Association between seroprevalence of measles virus in monkeys and degree of human-monkey contact in Bangladesh,OA,Gold OA,-,-,-,-,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.onehlt.2023.100571,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85161038864,"Bangladesh, Macaca mulatta, Measles, One health, Seroprevalence, Spillback, Zooanthroponosis","Measles infections can cause significant morbidity and mortality in human and monkey populations. The endemicity of measles in human populations and viral circulation within populations of free-living monkeys may have important repercussions for potential zoonotic transmission events and for the long-term health of monkey populations. Yet, there has not yet been a rigorous investigation of the dynamics of measles transmission where human and monkey populations coexist. In this study, to determine the difference in seroprevalence of the measles virus across different contexts of human-monkey contact, we analyzed serum samples collected from 56 apparently healthy Macaca mulatta monkeys who occupied diverse contexts, with different degrees of human-monkey contact, in Bangladesh. This is the first report of measles virus seroprevalence in monkeys in Bangladesh. We found a clear association between measles virus seropositivity in monkeys and the context in which they interact with humans. Seroprevalence was the lowest in wild areas (0.0%) and increased in shrines (4.8%), urban areas (5.9%), and was highest among monkeys who are used as performance animals (50.0%). This work suggests that a One Health approach informed by local interspecies transmission dynamics is necessary to develop strategies that both improve measles vaccination coverage, achieve long-term surveillance in monkey populations, and prevent measles spillback to monkeys. This approach aims to inform conservation efforts and protect the long-term health of human and monkey populations.",100571,10.1016/j.onehlt.2023.100571,23527714,,,,85161038864 (Scopus),,,,2023-12-01,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.onehlt.2023.100571,One Health,17
"Composition and function of the Galapagos penguin gut microbiome vary with age, location, and a putative bacterial pathogen",OA,Gold OA,-,-,Green Final OA,-,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-31826-y,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85151320423,,"Microbial colonization plays a direct role in host health. Understanding the ecology of the resident microbial community for a given host species is thus an important step for detecting population vulnerabilities like disease. However, the idea of integrating microbiome research into conservation is still relatively new, and wild birds have received less attention in this field than mammals or domesticated animals. Here we examine the composition and function of the gut microbiome of the endangered Galapagos penguin (Spheniscus mendiculus) with the goals of characterizing the normal microbial community and resistome, identifying likely pathogens, and testing hypotheses of structuring forces for this community based on demographics, location, and infection status. We collected fecal samples from wild penguins in 2018 and performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing and whole genome sequencing (WGS) on extracted DNA. 16S sequencing revealed that the bacterial phyla Fusobacteria, Epsilonbacteraeota, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria dominate the community. Functional pathways were computed from WGS data, showing genetic functional potential primarily focused on metabolism—amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and energy metabolism are the most well-represented functional groups. WGS samples were each screened for antimicrobial resistance, characterizing a resistome made up of nine antibiotic resistance genes. Samples were screened for potential enteric pathogens using virulence factors as indicators; Clostridium perfringens was revealed as a likely pathogen. Overall, three factors appear to be shaping the alpha and beta diversity of the microbial community: penguin developmental stage, sampling location, and C. perfringens. We found that juvenile penguins have significantly lower alpha diversity than adults based on three metrics, as well as significantly different beta diversity. Location effects are minimal, but one site has significantly lower Shannon diversity than the other primary sites. Finally, when samples were grouped by C. perfringens virulence factors, we found dramatic changes in beta diversity based on operational taxonomic units, protein families, and functional pathways. This study provides a baseline microbiome for an endangered species, implicates both penguin age and the presence of a potential bacterial pathogen as primary factors associated with microbial community variance, and reveals widespread antibiotic resistance genes across the population.",5358,10.1038/s41598-023-31826-y,20452322,,National Science Foundation,2018.02,85151320423 (Scopus),,1,,2023-12-01,37005428.0,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-31826-y,Scientific Reports,13

Methods: Participants of this study were 91 addiction treatment providers (e.g., therapists, physicians, community support specialists, administrative staff) recruited from various treatment facilities (e.g., inpatient and outpatient settings). Mixed method analyses were conducted to assess self-reported burnout, sources of work-related stress, and perceived work quality during the pandemic. Responses from providers reporting COVID-19 related decreases in work quality were compared to responses from providers who reported their quality of work had increased or remained the same. Results: Results demonstrated half of providers (51%) reported their quality of work had decreased. This perceived decrease in quality of work was associated with higher levels of emotional exhaustion (M = 17.41 vs. M = 12.48, p = 0.002), workplace stress (M = 42.80 vs. M = 30.84, p = 0.001), as well as decreased enjoyment of work (83% vs. 51%, p = 0.001) and decreased personal accomplishment (M = 20.64 vs. M = 23.05 p = 0.001). Qualitative investigations further illustrated that increased hours, changes in work schedules, work-life balance challenges, difficulties with client communication, and increased client needs were contributing factors increasing stress/burnout and decreasing perceived work quality. Conclusions: Addiction treatment providers experience high levels of burnout and workplace stress.

Methods: Focus groups were conducted with stakeholders providing substance use prevention services in Black communities in St. Louis, MO (n = 14). One focus group included peer advocates and volunteers conducting outreach-based services and one included active community health workers. Focus groups were held at community partner organizations familiar to participants. Data collection was facilitated by an interview guide with open-ended prompts. Focus groups were audio recorded and professionally transcribed. Transcripts were analyzed using grounded theory to abstract line-by-line codes into higher order themes and interpret their associations. Results: A core theme was identified from participants’ narratives suggesting that opioid overdose death among Black individuals is driven by unmet needs for safety, security, stability, and survival (The 4Ss). A lack of The 4Ss was reflective of structural disinvestment and healthcare and social service barriers perpetuated by systemic racism. Participants unmet 4S needs are associated with health and social consequences that perpetuate overdose and detrimentally impact recovery efforts. Participants identified cultural and relationship-based strategies that may address The 4Ss and mitigate overdose in Black communities.

More than two thousand MVC survivors were enrolled in the emergency department (ED) and completed a rotating battery of brief smartphone-based surveys over a 2-month period. Measurement models developed from survey item responses were used in latent growth curve/mixture modeling to characterize homogeneous symptom trajectories. Associations between individual trajectories and pre-trauma and peritraumatic characteristics and traditional outcomes were compared, along with associations within and between trajectories. APNS across all ten symptom domains were common in the first two months after trauma. Many risk factors and associations with high symptom burden trajectories were shared across domains. Both across and within traditional diagnostic boundaries, APNS trajectory intercepts, and slopes were substantially correlated. Across all domains, symptom severity in the immediate aftermath of trauma (trajectory intercepts) had the greatest influence on the outcome.

The analysis focuses on the widely used ‘weight and rate’ method of multicriteria decision-making, but the findings also provide perspectives on scale dependence in numerous settings. We introduce a simulation method to generate ‘weight and rate’ decisions uniformly and use simulation to characterize the sensitivity of the obtained rankings to monotonic transformations. We define a weight-rate function and cumulative weight-rate function to characterize decision alternatives and draw on the results of stochastic dominance to address the sensitivity of the rankings to the choice of the constructed scale analytically for certain classes of decisions. We define absolute, first-order, and second-order weight-rate dominance conditions. We also define a special case where the domain of the weight-rate function of one alternative is contained within the domain of another. We show that this special case is especially sensitive to the constructed scale. We also show via simulations that increasing the number of attributes or the number of alternatives increases sensitivity to the constructed ratings scale. The numerical and theoretical results show the ranking of decision alternatives is sensitive to the constructed scale, except in limited cases such as absolute and first-order weight-rate dominance.

Evenness mediates the global relationship between forest productivity and richness,OA,-,Hybrid Gold OA,-,-,-,https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.14098,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85159045617,"diversity, ecosystem function and services, evenness, forests, global, productivity, species richness","1. Biodiversity is an important component of natural ecosystems, with higher species richness often correlating with an increase in ecosystem productivity. Yet, this relationship varies substantially across environments, typically becoming less pronounced at high levels of species richness. However, species richness alone cannot reflect all important properties of a community, including community evenness, which may mediate the relationship between biodiversity and productivity. If the evenness of a community correlates negatively with richness across forests globally, then a greater number of species may not always increase overall diversity and productivity of the system. Theoretical work and local empirical studies have shown that the effect of evenness on ecosystem functioning may be especially strong at high richness levels, yet the consistency of this remains untested at a global scale. 2. Here, we used a dataset of forests from across the globe, which includes composition, biomass accumulation and net primary productivity, to explore whether productivity correlates with community evenness and richness in a way that evenness appears to buffer the effect of richness. Specifically, we evaluated whether low levels of evenness in speciose communities correlate with the attenuation of the richness–productivity relationship. 3. We found that tree species richness and evenness are negatively correlated across forests globally, with highly speciose forests typically comprising a few dominant and many rare species. Furthermore, we found that the correlation between diversity and productivity changes with evenness: at low richness, uneven communities are more productive, while at high richness, even communities are more productive. 4. Synthesis. Collectively, these results demonstrate that evenness is an integral component of the relationship between biodiversity and productivity, and that the attenuating effect of richness on forest productivity might be partly explained by low evenness in speciose communities. Productivity generally increases with species richness, until reduced evenness limits the overall increases in community diversity. Our research suggests that evenness is a fundamental component of biodiversity–ecosystem function relationships, and is of critical importance for guiding conservation and sustainable ecosystem management decisions.",,10.1111/1365-2745.14098,13652745,1308,Villum Fonden,16549,85159045617 (Scopus),00220477,6,1326,2023-06-01,,https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.14098,Journal of Ecology,111

Creating a new conceptual and normative model of the ethics of precision health can ensure that good medicine is also excellent and that excellent medicine is also good by providing a resource to scientists and clinicians. First, I propose a new conceptual analysis of precision health. I argue that precision health is defined primarily by targeted medical interventions and not by stratification, as others have asserted. Next, I argue that failure to be adequately responsive to this conceptual analysis explains common ethical abuses in the field. Third, I argue that this conceptual analysis can also pave the way for future research heretofore overlooked.

Such complicated noise may reduce the quality of the obtained HSIs and limit the accuracy of the subsequent processing. By using the low-rank prior of the tensor formed by spatial and spectral information and further exploring the intrinsic structure of the underlying HSI from noisy observations, in this paper, we propose a new nonconvex low-rank tensor approximation method including optimization model and efficient iterative algorithm to eliminate multiple types of noise. The proposed mathematical model consists of a nonconvex low-rank regularization term using the γ nuclear norm, which is nonconvex surrogate to Tucker rank, and two data fidelity terms representing sparse and Gaussian noise components, which are regularized by the ℓ 1 -norm and the Frobenius norm, respectively. To solve this model, we propose an efficient augmented Lagrange multiplier algorithm. We also study the convergence and parameter setting of the algorithm.

The predictive ability of rating gaps is greater for more opaque and volatile issuers. Such predictability was more pronounced during the 2008 financial crisis but weakened in the post–Dodd–Frank Act period. This finding is consistent with credit rating agencies’ efforts to improve their performance when facing regulatory pressure. Moreover, our analysis identifies rating-gap signals that do (do not) lead to subsequent Moody's actions to place issuers on negative outlook and watchlists. We find that negative signals from MIR gaps have a real economic impact on issuers’ fundamentals such as profitability, leverage, investment, and default risk, thus supporting the recovery-efforts hypothesis.",,10.1111/jfir.12325,14756803,251,"Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee",LU13501214,85153478036 (Scopus),02702592,2,289,2023-06-01,,https://doi.org/10.1111/jfir.12325,Journal of Financial Research,46

For each species, I provide an image of a representative female face, as well as information on intraspecific variation in female facial color patterns, and sexual dimorphism of facial color patterns, when available. Facial color patterns were common across species and were composed of a mixture of yellow, red-brown, and black pigments. Patterns were similar in visible and UV images. Spectral sensitivity curves for yellow, red-brown, and black pigmented regions have a similar shape for all Polistes species measured.

Here, we used a mobilizable, highly responsive genetically encoded fluorescent indicator, green fluorescent protein (GFP)–N160RbohD, to monitor PA dynamics in living cells. The majority of GFP–N160RbohD accumulated at the plasma membrane and sensitively responded to changes in PA levels. Cellular, pharmacological, and genetic analyses illustrated that both salinity and abscisic acid rapidly enhanced GFP–N160RbohD fluorescence at the plasma membrane, which mainly depended on hydrolysis of phospholipase D. By contrast, heat stress induced nuclear translocation of PA indicated by GFP–N160RbohD through a process that required diacylglycerol kinase activity, as well as secretory and endocytic trafficking. Strikingly, we showed that gravity triggers asymmetric PA distribution at the root apex, a response that is suppressed by PLDζ2 knockout.

Currently, there are limited pathogen control alternatives that are environment friendly and economically accessible. The use of fungi isolated from the plant endomycobiota in their native habitats is on the rise because studies show their great potential for biological control. To begin to generate a green alternative to control M. citricolor, the objectives of the present study were to (i) collect, identify, screen (in vitro and in planta), and select endophytic fungi from wild Rubiaceae collected in old-growth forests of Costa Rica; (ii) confirm endophytic colonization in coffee plantlets; (iii) evaluate the effects of the endophytes on plantlet development; and (iv) corroborate the antagonistic ability in planta.

Although medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) is the standard of treatment, utilization among PPWP has remained low because of MOUD stigma and misconceptions. The current report examined general and pregnancy-related MOUD attitudes, norms, and self-efficacy among PPWP seeking treatment. METHODS: Participants (n = 33) receiving MOUD at a Midwestern clinic reported beliefs about MOUD in general using the Attitudes toward Methadone Questionnaire (modified to include all MOUD) and during pregnancy/postpartum using an investigator-generated scale based on previous research. Participants responded using a 5-point scale from ""strongly agree"" to ""strongly disagree"" with higher scores indicating more positive attitudes. Analyses examined the bivariate association of attitudes with MOUD subjective norms and self-efficacy, also measured via investigator-generated scales. RESULTS: Respondents reported positive attitudes toward MOUD use during pregnancy, with most agreeing it was safe. However, up-to-half of participants reported uncertainty regarding the appropriate dosage of MOUD and its impact on the fetus and/or neonate. Both general and pregnancy/postpartum-related MOUD attitudes were positively associated with subjective norms toward MOUD. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant and postpartum women and people reported high uncertainty about MOUD use despite currently using it, emphasizing the need for strategies that assess and mitigate MOUD-related stigma.

We explored several ecological drivers potentially affecting the local prevalence and richness of avian malaria parasite lineages in native and introduced house sparrows (Passer domesticus) populations. Location: Global. Time period: 2002–2019. Major taxa studied: Avian Plasmodium parasites in house sparrows. Methods: We analysed data from 2,220 samples from 69 localities across all continents, except Antarctica. The influence of environment (urbanization index and human density), geography (altitude, latitude, hemisphere) and time (bird breeding season and years since introduction) were analysed using generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) and random forests. Results: Overall, 670 sparrows (30.2%) were infected with 22 Plasmodium lineages. In native populations, parasite prevalence was positively related to urbanization index, with the highest prevalence values in areas with intermediate urbanization levels. Likewise, in introduced populations, prevalence was positively associated with urbanization index; however, higher infection occurred in areas with either extreme high or low levels of urbanization. In introduced populations, the number of parasite lineages increased with altitude and with the years elapsed since the establishment of sparrows in a new locality. Here, after a decline in the number of parasite lineages in the first 30 years, an increase from 40 years onwards was detected. Main conclusions: Urbanization was related to parasite prevalence in both native and introduced bird populations. In invaded areas, altitude and time since bird introduction were related to the number of Plasmodium lineages found to be infecting sparrows.",,10.1111/geb.13651,14668238,809,Horizon 2020 Framework Programme,844285,85150612224 (Scopus),1466822X,5,823,2023-05-01,,https://doi.org/10.1111/geb.13651,Global Ecology and Biogeography,32

They are known to form 1:1 complexes with 3β-hydroxysterols such as cholesterol causing membrane disruption. So far, the visual evidence showcasing the complexes formed between glycoalkaloids and sterols in monolayers has been mainly restricted to some earlier studies using Brewster angle microscopy which were of low resolution showing the formation of floating aggregates of these complexes. This study is aimed at using atomic force microscopy (AFM) for topographic and morphological analysis of the aggregates of these sterol-glycoalkaloid complexes. Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) transfer of mixed monolayers of the glycoalkaloid α-tomatine, sterols, and lipids in varying molar ratios onto mica followed by AFM examination was performed. The AFM method allowed visualization of the aggregation of sterol-glycoalkaloid complexes at nanometer resolution. While aggregation was observed in mixed monolayers of α-tomatine with cholesterol and in mixed monolayers with coprostanol, no sign of complexation was observed for the mixed monolayers of epicholesterol and α-tomatine, confirming their lack of interaction found in prior monolayer studies. Aggregates were observed in transferred monolayers of ternary mixtures of α-tomatine with cholesterol and the phospholipids 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) or egg sphingomyelin (egg SM). The formation of aggregates was found to be less prevalent for mixed monolayers of DMPC and cholesterol containing α-tomatine than it was for mixed monolayers containing egg SM and cholesterol with α-tomatine.

This challenge can be compounded by collection biases, which may downweight specimens morphologically intermediate between traditional species. Additionally, mismatch between named species and observable phenotypes can compromise species conservation.

We employed two novel approaches: sampling ex situ collections to detect phenotypic plasticity caused by environmental variation and comparing random field samples with historical herbarium samples to identify collection biases that might undermine species delimitation. To provide genetic evidence, we also performed molecular analyses on genome-wide SNPs. Quercus acerifolia shows distinctive morphological, ecological, and genomic characteristics, rejecting the hypothesis that Q. acerifolia is a phenotypic variant of Q. shumardii.

To realize the potential for sustainable production of camelina, a better understanding of how camelina seed oil production and composition respond to low input environments is desired. Phosphorus (P) is one of the least available essential macronutrients to plants with finite worldwide supply. This study investigated seed oil production and lipid composition of camelina in field settings and under greenhouse conditions in response to P deficiency. Lipidomic profiling reveals that P deficiency in field settings triggered extensive leaf lipid remodeling that decreased the ratio of phospholipids to non-P-containing galactolipids from 30% to 5% under P sufficient to deficient conditions. P deficiency increased seed oil content per seed weight by approximately 25% and 20% in field and greenhouse settings, respectively. In addition, P deficiency altered seed fatty acid composition, with increases in monounsaturated 18:1 and 20:1 and decreases in polyunsaturated 18:3. Total seed production was decreased by 10- to 15-fold under P deficiency and the decrease resulted from reduced seed numbers without affecting seed weight. The results from field and greenhouse conditions indicate that P deficiency increases seed oil content, alters fatty acid composition, and decreases greatly seed production, suggesting that achieving a high yield and quality of camelina seed oil is positively linked to P status of soil.",111636,10.1016/j.plantsci.2023.111636,18732259,,National Institutes of Health,1022148,85148352354 (Scopus),01689452,,,2023-05-01,36791961.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2023.111636,Plant Science,330

We consider how the combination of monetary sanctions, warrants, incarceration, and overpolicing in the region affects avoidance behaviors, particularly for people of color. Our findings suggest that the frequently unpredictable nature of police contacts and the parochial and often profit-focused structure of policing organizations in the region leads individuals to modify the ways in which they move through the region and, for some, to isolate.

We find that court actors hold gendered attributions of girls’ delinquency, in turn informing their decision-making about how to treat and sanction girls. Paternalism remains a persistent feature in how the system locates, defines, and responds to girls through varying gendered attributions.

The aim of this study was to quantify the effects of comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease and adverse social determinants of health on brain ageing in people with HIV and people without HIV. Methods: In this retrospective case-control study, people with HIV from Washington University in St Louis, MO, USA, and people without HIV identified through community organisations or the Research Participant Registry were clinically characterised and underwent 3-Tesla T1-weighted MRI between Dec 3, 2008, and Oct 4, 2022. Exclusion criteria were established by a combination of self-reports and medical records. DeepBrainNet, a publicly available machine learning algorithm, was applied to estimate brain-predicted age from MRI for people with HIV and people without HIV. The brain-age gap, defined as the difference between brain-predicted age and true chronological age, was modelled as a function of clinical, comorbid, and social factors by use of linear regression. Variables were first examined singly for associations with brain-age gap, then combined into multivariate models with best-subsets variable selection. Findings: In people with HIV (mean age 44·8 years [SD 15·5]; 78% [296 of 379] male; 69% [260] Black; 78% [295] undetectable viral load), brain-age gap was associated with Framingham cardiovascular risk score (p=0·0034), detectable viral load (>50 copies per mL; p=0·0023), and hepatitis C co-infection (p=0·0065). After variable selection, the final model for people with HIV retained Framingham score, hepatitis C, and added unemployment (p=0·0015). Educational achievement assayed by reading proficiency was linked with reduced brain-age gap (p=0·016) for people without HIV but not for people with HIV, indicating a potential resilience factor. When people with HIV and people without HIV were modelled jointly, selection resulted in a model containing cardiovascular risk (p=0·0039), hepatitis C (p=0·037), Area Deprivation Index (p=0·033), and unemployment (p=0·00010). Male sex (p=0·078) and alcohol use history (p=0·090) were also included in the model but were not individually significant. Interpretation: Our findings indicate that comorbid and social determinants of health are associated with brain ageing in people with HIV, alongside traditional HIV metrics such as viral load and CD4 cell count, suggesting the need for a broadened clinical perspective on healthy ageing with HIV, with additional focus on comorbidities, lifestyle changes, and social factors.

We investigated the relationship between HIV-1 subtype C Vpr sequence variation and HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment as measured by global deficit score (GDS) in treatment-naive individuals. We used different bioinformatic tools and statistical models to correlate vpr variation and cognitive function. We identified a tyrosine at position 45 (45Y) as a signature for neurocognitive impairment and histidine (45H) as a signature in the non-impaired individuals. The presence of signature 45Y was associated by 3.66 times higher GDS, 525 times higher plasma viral load, 15.84 times higher proviral load, and 60% lower absolute CD4-T cell count compared with those without the signature. Additionally, we identified four conserved Vpr fragment sequences, PEDQGPQREPYNEWTLE (5-21), LGQYIY (42-47), TYGDTW (49-54), and PEDQGPQREPYNEW (5-18), that were associated with higher plasma viral load and proviral load. The implication of these findings is that variation of Vpr leads to neurocognitive impairment in HIV infection and worsens the progression of disease in general by promoting the production of provirus, promoting HIV replication and depletion of CD4+ T cells in the periphery.",,10.1089/aid.2022.0022,19318405,166,National Research Foundation,17/07,85146249310 (Scopus),08892229,4,175,2023-04-01,36401355.0,https://doi.org/10.1089/aid.2022.0022,AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses,39
The Role of Dimensions of Emotion Dysregulation Following Exposure to Maltreatment and Adult Victimization,-,-,-,-,-,-,https://doi.org/10.1177/08862605221127188,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85139633576,"dimensions of emotion regulation, emotion dysregulation, maltreatment, posttraumatic stress symptoms, victimization","Child maltreatment is related to a host of negative consequences, including difficulties with emotion regulation (ER), posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), and greater risk for revictimization. Yet, the literature has largely focused on sexual revictimization, while relations between maltreatment and other adult victimization types (e.g., intimate partner violence [IPV]) are less clear. Further, associations between emotion dysregulation and both child and adult trauma exposure have been identified, but aspects of dysregulation (i.e., nonacceptance of emotional responses, difficulties engaging in goal-directed behavior, impulsivity, lack of emotional awareness, limited access to ER strategies, and lack of emotional clarity) have received less attention. This study aimed to: (1) investigate the associations between maltreatment and adult victimization and the six ER dimensions while accounting for PTSS, and (2) determine whether there are indirect effects between maltreatment and adult victimization through each ER component. Seven hundred and forty-four undergraduates from two universities participated in the study (Mage = 21.48, SD = 4.12; 80.9% women; 56.2% white). Maltreatment and PTSS were directly linked with adult victimization (B = 0.14, B = 0.01, respectively). PTSS was inversely associated with each ER aspect (Bs = 0.02–0.10). Unexpectedly, neither maltreatment nor adult victimization was related to the ER dimensions, and no indirect effects were observed between maltreatment and adult victimization through emotion dysregulation. These findings suggest that specific components of emotion dysregulation may not be tied to trauma exposure outside of PTSS. Further, it may be that the ER dimensions are not differentially related to increased risk for adult victimization.",,10.1177/08862605221127188,15526518,5661,,,85139633576 (Scopus),08862605,7-8,5681,2023-04-01,36205437.0,https://doi.org/10.1177/08862605221127188,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,38

Randomization plays a vital role in defining the convergence rate and performance of the algorithm. However, excessive use of randomization may adversely affect the performance of the algorithm. Therefore, a proper balance in randomization, exploitation, and exploration is required to improve the convergence rate of the algorithm. One of the methods to solve the optimization problems is Environmental Adaptation Method. It is a randomized algorithm that works on the theory of adaptive learning. It was followed by an enhanced version named Improved Environmental Adaptation Method. Both of these algorithms used binary encoding to represent the solutions. Since binary encoding requires extra efforts to convert a binary solution to a real solution, a real parameter version of the algorithm will be a good alternative to solve problems. In this paper, we present a new real parameter algorithm named Advanced Environmental Adaptation Method with a novel approach to balance randomization, exploitation, and exploration. This is achieved using operators that make it efficient to search for optimal global solutions. We compare the performance of this new algorithm with other state-of-the-art algorithms.

Although criminological datasets are used to study and document the extent of such disparities, they often lack key information, including arrestees’ racial identification. As AI technologies are increasingly used by criminal justice agencies to make predictions about outcomes in bail, policing, and other decision-making, a growing literature suggests that the current implementation of these systems may perpetuate racial inequalities. In this paper, we argue that AI technologies should be investigated to understand how they recognize racial categories and whether they can be harnessed to fill missing race data. By bridging this gap, we can work towards better understanding racial inequalities in a wide range of contexts, most notably criminal justice. Using a multidisciplinary perspective, we rethink the design and methodology used in facial processing technology (FPT) based on supervised deep learning model (DLM) image classification. By modifying standard FPT pipelines to tackle multiple sources of DLM bias, we propose an experimental methodology based on ethical AI principles to generate binary (Black and White) racial categories using mugshots. We go beyond simply reporting DLM accuracies and address fundamental issues such as generalizability and interpretability by using a “self-auditing” approach. First, we evaluate the inference performances of 42 fine-tuned DLMs using unseen test images from the same dataset but subject to varying data augmentations. Next, to interpret and validate our methodological approach, we apply gradient-based saliency maps to assess the consistency of facial region relevance and attribution. Finally, drawing upon insights from three areas (computer science, sociology, and law), we investigate the efficacy of our DLM-based method as a tool for detecting racial inequalities in criminal justice.",,10.1007/s00146-022-01440-z,14355655,897,,,85129562355 (Scopus),09515666,2,918,2023-04-01,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00146-022-01440-z,AI and Society,38

Recent research however has not observed consistent racial/ethnic differences in posttraumatic stress in the early aftermath of trauma, suggesting that such differences in chronic PTSD rates may be related to differences in recovery over time. Methods As part of the multisite, longitudinal AURORA study, we investigated racial/ethnic differences in PTSD and related outcomes within 3 months after trauma. Participants (n = 930) were recruited from emergency departments across the USA and provided periodic (2 weeks, 8 weeks, and 3 months after trauma) self-report assessments of PTSD, depression, dissociation, anxiety, and resilience. Linear models were completed to investigate racial/ethnic differences in posttraumatic dysfunction with subsequent follow-up models assessing potential effects of prior life stressors. Results Racial/ethnic groups did not differ in symptoms over time; however, Black participants showed reduced posttraumatic depression and anxiety symptoms overall compared to Hispanic participants and White participants. Racial/ethnic differences were not attenuated after accounting for differences in sociodemographic factors. However, racial/ethnic differences in depression and anxiety were no longer significant after accounting for greater prior trauma exposure and childhood emotional abuse in White participants. Conclusions The present findings suggest prior differences in previous trauma exposure partially mediate the observed racial/ethnic differences in posttraumatic depression and anxiety symptoms following a recent trauma. Our findings further demonstrate that racial/ethnic groups show similar rates of symptom recovery over time.

However, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a rapid shift to telehealth services, pushing patients and providers to adapt to therapy in an online format. Only a few studies have assessed providers’ attitudes about the transition of DBT to telemedicine during COVID-19, identifying both challenges and advantages. Using an online self-report survey, the current study assessed DBT therapists’ experiences with telehealth use for DBT implementation, with an emphasis on clinicians’ fear of treating suicidal patients (N = 99). Despite endorsing some challenges with telehealth, almost all therapists reported they will continue implementing some DBT via telehealth post-COVID, highlighting both clinicians’ perceived benefits and challenges of telehealth. Fear of treating suicidal patients was associated with higher perceived telehealth challenges and higher reported future telehealth use. Several other descriptive patterns are discussed. This study provides important preliminary findings about DBT therapists’ telehealth practices and experiences, suggesting future directions for research and practice.

Pain, depression, avoidance of trauma reminders, reexperiencing trauma, anxiety, hyperarousal, sleep disruption, and nightmares have been reported. Wrist-wearable devices with accelerometers capable of assessing 24-hour rest-activity characteristics are prevalent and may have utility in measuring these outcomes. Objective: To evaluate whether wrist-wearable devices can provide useful biomarkers for recovery after traumatic stress exposure. Design, Setting, and Participants: Data were analyzed from a diverse cohort of individuals seen in the emergency department after experiencing a traumatic stress exposure, as part of the Advancing Understanding of Recovery After Trauma (AURORA) study. Participants recruited from 27 emergency departments wore wrist-wearable devices for 8 weeks, beginning in the emergency department, and completed serial assessments of neuropsychiatric symptoms. A total of 19019 patients were screened. Of these, 3040 patients met study criteria, provided informed consent, and completed baseline assessments. A total of 2021 provided data from wrist-wearable devices, completed the 8-week assessment, and were included in this analysis. The data were randomly divided into 2 equal parts (n = 1010) for biomarker identification and validation. Data were collected from September 2017 to January 2020, and data were analyzed from May 2020 to November 2022. Exposures: Participants were recruited for the study after experiencing a traumatic stress exposure (most commonly motor vehicle collision). Main Outcomes and Measures: Rest-activity characteristics were derived and validated from wrist-wearable devices associated with specific self-reported symptom domains at a point in time and changes in symptom severity over time. Results: Of 2021 included patients, 1257 (62.2%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 35.8 (13.0) years. Eight wrist-wearable device biomarkers for symptoms of adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae exceeded significance thresholds in the derivation cohort. One of these, reduced 24-hour activity variance, was associated with greater pain severity (r = -0.14; 95% CI, -0.20 to -0.07). Changes in 6 rest-activity measures were associated with changes in pain over time, and changes in the number of transitions between sleep and wake over time were associated with changes in pain, sleep, and anxiety. Simple cutoffs for these biomarkers identified individuals with good recovery for pain (positive predictive value [PPV], 0.85; 95% CI, 0.82-0.88), sleep (PPV, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.59-0.67, and anxiety (PPV, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.72-0.80) with high predictive value.

Data was derived from adults diagnosed with OUD (N = 389). To analyze the covariance between the 11 items of the FHAM, principal component analysis was applied to infer principal components (PC) scores. Log-binominal regression was conducted to quantify the associations between PC scores and mental health symptoms (e.g., lifetime suicidal attempt, P30D suicidal ideation, depression, and anxiety). Analyses revealed that the first 3 three PCs could account for 56% of the total variance of the FHAM items within the data. Family history of substance misuse (PC1) was positively associated with lifetime suicide attempts and severe anxiety. Family history of serious mental illness (PC2) and of suicidal behavior (PC3) were not significantly associated with any outcomes. Our findings suggest current suicide risk is associated with an array of familial psychiatric issues among people with OUD. However, family history of suicide attempts and death by suicide has less bearing on current suicide risk in OUD patients whereas family history of substance use confers significant risk.

The primary outcome was substantial posttraumatic stress symptoms at 3 months (Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 ≥38). Logistic regression derivation models were evaluated for discriminative ability using the area under the curve and the accuracy of predicted risk probabilities (Brier score). Candidate posttraumatic stress predictors assessed in these models (n=265) spanned a range of sociodemographic, baseline health, peritraumatic, and mechanistic domains. The final model selection was based on performance and ease of administration. Results: Significant 3-month posttraumatic stress symptoms were common in the derivation (27%) and validation (26%) cohort.

However, the enzymes and mechanisms underlying such metabolism are still largely unknown. We previously reported that the Cyclophostin & Cyclipostins (CyC) analogues, a new family of potent antimycobacterial molecules, react specifically and covalently with (Ser/Cys)-based enzymes mostly involved in bacterial lipid metabolism. Here, we report the synthesis of new CyC alkyne-containing inhibitors (CyCyne) and their use for the direct fishing of target proteins in M. tb culture via bio-orthogonal click-chemistry activity-based protein profiling (CC-ABPP). This approach led to the capture and identification of a variety of enzymes, and many of them involved in lipid or steroid metabolisms. One of the captured enzymes, HsaD (Rv3569c), is required for the survival of M. tb within macrophages and is thus a potential therapeutic target. This prompted us to further explore and validate, through a combination of biochemical and structural approaches, the specificity of HsaD inhibition by the CyC analogues. We confirmed that the CyC bind covalently to the catalytic Ser114 residue, leading to a total loss of enzyme activity. These data were supported by the X-ray structures of four HsaD-CyC complexes, obtained at resolutions between 1.6 and 2.6 Å.

We use these estimates to predict the severity of charges at arrest and filing, and examine differences in the severity of charges between stages. Results: Compared to White non-Latinx people, police charge Black Latinx people with drug crimes that are 1.8 times more severe and Black non-Latinx people with drug crimes that are 1.6 times more severe at arrest. These inequalities are maintained throughout the charging trajectory. Greater charge reductions occur between arrest and filing than between filing and conviction, highlighting the importance of police in charging trajectories. We find small increases in charging trajectory, where racial-ethnic disparities persist at conviction.

It is envisioned that the future Edge-IoT systems will incorporate heterogeneous IoT devices distributed over multiple geographical zones of certain institutions with edge resource demands that vary according to time and location. Edge servers (resource facilitators) are with limited resources and are susceptible to 'outlandish' situations, such as service overloading, outage, and external attacks; they may also have to handle the roaming of IoT devices among different zones. These situations induce the need for alternative edge servers using an adaptive resource facilitation scheme to fulfill the demands of the IoT applications. In this article, we develop a novel intelligent and hierarchical resource facilitation framework named I-HARF that adapts to dynamic Edge-IoT situations, including outlandish situations, mobility, application's sensitivity, and varying resource demand of IoT applications based on time and location. I-HARF achieves an adaptive facilitation and holistically addresses the facilitation technical barriers by: 1) adopting the hierarchical structure which efficiently migrates the resource facilitation from intrazone to interzone levels; 2) extending novel intrazone and interzone optimization models to boost the utilities of the edge servers and the IoT applications; and 3) developing a novel and unique actor dual-critic and collective actor-critic deep reinforcement learning (DRL) designs that intelligently facilitate the edge resources in both intrazone and interzone, respectively.

We also examine whether these patterns are robust for different regions of the city and racial/ethnic compositions of neighborhoods. Methods: Using longitudinal neighborhood data over 40 years in St. Louis, Missouri, we test whether education has consequences for violent crime with a series of two-way fixed effects models. Results: Neighborhoods with more college degrees in more recent time periods are generally associated with reductions in violent crime, especially in the white, southern region of the city. In contrast, neighborhoods with greater reliance on high school degrees were associated with violence reduction in the past, especially in the Black, northern part of the city, but the relationship no longer holds in the modern era. Both time and place therefore matter for education’s association with crime in neighborhoods.

As the subjective dimension of interoception, interoceptive sensibility plays a key role in individuals’ health. Self-objectification, a process by which individuals tend to adopt a third-person's perspective of their physical self, leads to decreased interoceptive sensibility. However, few studies regarding the neural basis of interoceptive sensibility and the underlying mechanism of the relationship between self-objectification and interoceptive sensibility have been conducted. In this study, we assessed the resting-state brain activity (fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation, fALFF) and connectivity (resting-state functional connectivity, RSFC) of 442 college students. Whole-brain correlation analyses revealed that a higher level of interoceptive sensibility was linked to higher fALFF in the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and left cerebellum and to lower fALFF in the left paracentral lobule and left superior/middle temporal gyrus. Interoceptive sensibility also was negatively associated with the RSFC between the right IFG and the right secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) and the right IFG and the ventral premotor cortex (VPC).

In addition to mitigating water runoff and regulating building temperatures, green roofs can provide food and nesting resources for wildlife. Rooftop gardens can also be utilized to cultivate food crops, giving them the potential to attenuate instances of food insecurity which are commonplace in many urban areas. Given that many crops depend on bee pollination, it is imperative to characterize the rooftop bee community. Therefore, we sampled three urban food roofs near downtown St. Louis, MO during the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons. We found 38 bee species utilizing the rooftop farms. We then compared the rooftop bee communities to those of two nearby ground-level community gardens. The roofs had lower abundances of Bombus species than the ground-level sites while non-native cavity nesters in the genus Megachile were overrepresented. These results indicate that the rooftop bee communities represent a nested subset of the species found at ground level. This has important implications for the management of green roofs for growing crops, as this shift in bee community structure may play a role in determining which crops can be adequately supported with pollination services.",1100470,10.3389/frsc.2023.1100470,26249634,,Saint Louis University,,85148413538 (Scopus),,,,2023-02-03,,https://doi.org/10.3389/frsc.2023.1100470,Frontiers in Sustainable Cities,5
Versatile Technique to Produce a Hierarchical Design in Nanoporous Gold,-,-,-,-,-,-,https://doi.org/10.3791/65065,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85149049833,,"The potential to generate variable pore sizes, simplistic surface modification, and a breadth of commercial uses in the fields of biosensors, actuators, drug loading and release, and the development of catalysts have unquestionably accelerated the usage of nanoporous gold (NPG)-based nanomaterials in research and development. This article describes the process of the generation of hierarchical bimodal nanoporous gold (hb-NPG) by employing a step-wise procedure involving electrochemical alloying, chemical dealloying techniques, and annealing to create both macro-and mesopores. This is done to improve the utility of NPG by creating a bicontinuous solid/void morphology. The area available for surface modification is enhanced by smaller pores, while molecular transport benefits from the network of larger pores. The bimodal architecture, which is the result of a series of fabrication steps, is visualized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) as a network of pores that are less than 100 nm in size and connected by ligaments to larger pores that are several hundred nanometers in size. The electrochemically active surface area of the hb-NPG is assessed using cyclic voltammetry (CV), with a focus on the critical roles that both dealloying and annealing play in creating the necessary structure. The adsorption of different proteins is measured by solution depletion technique, revealing the better performance of hb-NPG in terms of protein loading. By changing the surface area to volume ratio, the created hb-NPG electrode offers tremendous potential for biosensor development. The manuscript discusses a scalable method to create hb-NPG surface structures, as they offer a large surface area for the immobilization of small molecules and improved transport pathways for faster reactions.",e65065,10.3791/65065,,,National Institute of General Medical Sciences,GM111835,85149049833 (Scopus),1940087X,192,,2023-02-01,36847406.0,https://doi.org/10.3791/65065,Journal of Visualized Experiments,2023

A cancer diagnosis provides an opportunity to assist with smoking cessation; however, supportive oncology trials frequently exclude patients with SMI. To fill this gap, we examined differences in engagement and tobacco cessation in a pragmatic clinical trial.METHODS:We recruited 303 participants from two National Cancer Institute-designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers, of which 10% had prior diagnoses of SMI (major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia spectrum disorders). We compared self-reported smoking behaviors, patient attitudes and beliefs about cessation, and rates of trial completion, engagement, and smoking abstinence among recently diagnosed patients with cancer with and without SMI. Six months after trial completion, we completed qualitative interviews on barriers and facilitators to tobacco cessation in a random sample of participants with SMI.RESULTS:Trial participants with SMI had similar motivation to quit smoking as those without SMI. Additionally, participants with SMI had a similar ability to engage in a tobacco treatment trial (6.5 counseling sessions completed v 7.3 sessions) and benefit from tobacco treatment as those without SMI (32.3% v 27.8% 6-month quit rates).CONCLUSION:Patients with cancer and SMI were able to engage in and benefit from a tobacco cessation trial integrated into cancer care.

Motivated by the widespread adoption of drones in last-mile delivery, we introduce the minimum cost traveling salesman problem with multiple drones, where a truck and multiple drones work in synchronization to deliver parcels to customers. In this problem, we aim to find an optimal delivery plan for the truck and drones operating in tandem with the objective of minimizing the total operational cost including the vehicles’ operating and waiting costs. Unlike most studies in the literature where the objective is to minimize completion time, which means one needs to know only the arrival time of the latest arriving vehicle (truck or drone) at each synchronization point, we need to keep track of all the individual waiting times of the truck and the drones to properly account for waiting costs, which makes it more challenging to handle the synchronization. We provide a flow based and two cut based mixed integer linear programming formulations strengthened with valid inequalities. For non-compact models, we devise a variety of branch-and-cut schemes to solve our problem to optimality. To compare our formulations/algorithms and to demonstrate their competitiveness, we conduct computational experiments on a range of instances. The results indicate the superiority of utilizing branch-and-cut methodology over a flow based formulation. We also use our model to conduct sensitivity analyses with several problem parameters and to explore the benefits of launch and retrieval at the same node, the tradeoff between the number of drones and the operational cost, and the special case with a minimize completion objective with one drone.

Methods: A retrospective cohort design examined the effect of MOUD while incarcerated on 12 months post-release treatment engagement and retention, overdose mortality, and recidivism. Individuals (N = 1600) who participated in the Rhode Island Department of Corrections (RIDOC) MOUD program (the United States’ first statewide program) and were released from incarceration from December 1, 2016, to December 31, 2018, were included.

Methods: This study (n = 191) examined how developmental, sociodemographic and parent factors at age 2 were associated with parent reporting the child being evaluated by age 3. Two logistic regression analyses were conducted. The first model included children at age 2 with scores at least in the monitoring zone of developmental risk, and the second model included children with high developmental risk. Results: The first model found that children in the monitoring zone of developmental risk were more likely to be evaluated per parent report if they were born preterm, male, with increased behaviour problems, higher economic risk, increased maternal education, increased parental depressive symptoms and in urban areas and less likely if they were of Black or Hispanic/Latino ethnicity, had no health insurance or more home disorganisation. The second model found that children with high developmental risk were less likely to be evaluated per parent report if they were female, of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity, had better language skills and increased home disorganisation and more likely if their parents reported increased depressive symptoms or less economic risk.

Platyrrhines (monkeys in the Americas) exhibit a remarkable color vision polymorphism that may have been selected by both natural and sexual selection, but sociosexual color signaling among platyrrhines has received almost no attention. Here, we study the color of reproductive skin among different reproductive classes in free-ranging female saddleback (Leontocebus weddelli) and emperor (Saguinus imperator) tamarins, modeling color spaces, and contrasts for the different visual systems. We find that the chromatic saturation and luminance of genital color vary between reproductive classes in saddleback tamarins. Chromatic contrast between the vulva and belly is lower in the parous females (PFs) relative to adult but not currently breeding females, while achromatic contrast is higher in PFs in saddleback tamarins relative to nonparous females. However, in emperor tamarins, genital color (saturation, hue, and luminance) does not vary between reproductive classes. Overall, genital skin color variation is present in tamarins and may play a role in sexual signaling. Nevertheless, the patterns are inconsistent between species, suggesting interspecific variation.

The International Classification of Diseases, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) introduced codes to document HT in June 2018. The aim of this study is to identify characteristics of ED patients who experienced forced labor or sexual exploitation as a documented external cause of morbidity in US visits. Methods: Nationally representative surveillance based on patient visits to 989 hospital-owned EDs in the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample in 2019 became available in 2021. Eight ICD-10-CM codes to classify HT as an external cause of morbidity were combined into one HT variable for analysis in 2021–2022. Results: A weighted count of 517 of 33.1 million ED visits (0.0016%) documented HT as an external cause of morbidity. Of them, sexual exploitation (71.6%) was documented more frequently than labor exploitation (28.4%). Most HT-related codes were visits by females (87.3%) from large metropolitan areas, and identified as white. Approximately 40% of visits were from ZIP codes with a median household income less than $48,000 annually. Relative to all other ED visits, patients with HT as an external cause of morbidity had higher odds of being female (OR = 6.54, 95% CI:3.59, 11.92) and being a minor (OR = 1.76, 95% CI:1.02, 3.04). Conclusion: HT was rarely documented as an external cause of morbidity in 989 hospitals' ED visits from a nationally representative sample in 2019. Documentation of recently added HT ICD-10-CM codes does not appear to have been implemented sufficiently to yield an unbiased representation of those who experienced HT and presented in the ED. Efforts to enhance the utility of ICD-10-CM HT codes for surveillance and documentation must first address ED personnel training on identification and response to HT. In doing so, ED personnel also need to address ethical concerns (e.g. stigma, confidentiality, risk of patient harm) and allow for informed consent among trafficked patients in order to be scaled up responsibly.",,10.1016/j.ajem.2022.11.017,15328171,37,,,85142378712 (Scopus),07356757,,42,2023-02-01,36435008.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2022.11.017,American Journal of Emergency Medicine,64

In two experiments in a Missouri (USA) deciduous forest we quantified the impact of leaf tie construction and changes to leaf quality on subsequent leaf damage. First, using eight Quercus species, we compared damage to single leaves versus experimental leaf ties that had been stocked with either Pseudotelphusa quercinigracella (Gelechiidae) or Psilocorsis cryptolechiella (Depressariidae) to determine how initial leaf quality (total phenolics) influenced damage caused by shelter inhabitants. Skeletonization by leaf tying caterpillars and leaf edge chewing by free feeding species were 12.2× and 1.3× greater on tied than on non-tied leaves, respectively. July and September leaf phenolic content had a slight positive effect on the probability of skeletonization, none on the probability of edge damage, and a weakly positive or negative effect on the intensity of skeletonization and edge damage, depending on leaf position. Second, we created experimental leaf ties, protected from herbivores, on the same Quercus species to determine whether tie formation changes leaf quality (total phenolics, nitrogen, water, toughness). Tie formation decreased phenolics, but this change was predicted to add only 0.8% leaf area loss. Synthesis. Herbivory increased dramatically when leaves were in ties, with the effect mostly due to the tie itself rather than a change in leaf quality. We predict that the advantages of building and using leaf ties in this system are more likely to be escape from natural enemies and changes in abiotic factors.",,10.1111/een.13202,13652311,69,National Science Foundation,DEB 0614397,85141435428 (Scopus),03076946,1,80,2023-02-01,,https://doi.org/10.1111/een.13202,Ecological Entomology,48

Academic interest in officers’ use of deadly force includes attention to how officers make the decision to discharge their firearms during encounters with citizens. Binder and Scharf posited that actions and decisions made by officers early in a high-risk police-citizen encounter can impact their decision to use deadly force at the conclusion of the encounter. This decision-making model, however, has been subject to very little empirical scrutiny in the decades since it was proposed (see Fridell & Binder; Scharf & Binder for notable exceptions). To bring their comprehensive framework back to the forefront and provide additional empirical assessment, the authors used the Binder and Scharf model as a framework to examine 82 officers’ decisions to shoot or hold fire in incidents that involved multiple officers who ultimately made different decisions regarding lethal force. Results from the qualitative analysis suggest that the presence and actions of other officers on scene can have a notable impact on officers’ decision-making during a high-risk police-citizen encounter.

Therefore, understanding why vulnerability to infection varies within a host clade is a crucial task for conservation biology and for understanding macroecological life-history patterns. Here, we studied the relationship of avian life-history traits and climate on the prevalence of Plasmodium and Parahaemoproteus parasites. We sampled 3569 individual birds belonging to 53 species of the family Thraupidae. Individuals were captured from 2007 to 2018 at 92 locations. We created 2 phylogenetic generalized least-squares models with Plasmodium and Parahaemoproteus prevalence as our response variables, and with the following predictor variables: climate PC1, climate PC2, body size, mixed-species flock participation, incubation period, migration, nest height, foraging height, forest cover, and diet. We found that Parahaemoproteus and Plasmodium prevalence was higher in species inhabiting open habitats. Tanager species with longer incubation periods had higher Parahaemoproteus prevalence as well, and we hypothesize that these longer incubation periods overlap with maximum vector abundances, resulting in a higher probability of infection among adult hosts during their incubation period and among chicks. Lastly, we found that Plasmodium prevalence was higher in species without migratory behaviour, with mixed-species flock participation, and with an omnivorous or animal-derived diet.

Identifying which CAs put individuals at greatest risk for these adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae (APNS) is important for targeting prevention interventions. Methods Data came from n = 999 patients ages 18-75 presenting to 29 U.S. emergency departments after a motor vehicle collision (MVC) and followed for 3 months, the amount of time traditionally used to define chronic PTSD, in the Advancing Understanding of Recovery After Trauma (AURORA) study. Six CA types were self-reported at baseline: physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, physical neglect, emotional neglect and bullying. Both dichotomous measures of ever experiencing each CA type and numeric measures of exposure frequency were included in the analysis. Risk ratios (RRs) of these CA measures as well as complex interactions among these measures were examined as predictors of APNS 3 months post-MVC. APNS was defined as meeting self-reported criteria for either PTSD based on the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 and/or MDE based on the PROMIS Depression Short-Form 8b. We controlled for pre-MVC lifetime histories of PTSD and MDE. We also examined mediating effects through peritraumatic symptoms assessed in the emergency department and PTSD and MDE assessed in 2-week and 8-week follow-up surveys. Analyses were carried out with robust Poisson regression models. Results Most participants (90.9%) reported at least rarely having experienced some CA. Ever experiencing each CA other than emotional neglect was univariably associated with 3-month APNS (RRs = 1.31-1.60). Each CA frequency was also univariably associated with 3-month APNS (RRs = 1.65-2.45). In multivariable models, joint associations of CAs with 3-month APNS were additive, with frequency of emotional abuse (RR = 2.03; 95% CI = 1.43-2.87) and bullying (RR = 1.44; 95% CI = 0.99-2.10) being the strongest predictors. Control variable analyses found that these associations were largely explained by pre-MVC histories of PTSD and MDE.

Maintaining and promoting the coach–athlete relationship to meet athletes’ basic psychological needs is one way to reduce burnout. Existing studies of the correlation between coach-athlete relationships and athlete burnout have mainly focused on the coaches’ leadership style, with little attention given to relationship-maintenance strategies and the mechanism of athlete burnout from the athletes’ perspective. Methods: Using an online survey of 256 adolescent athletes, we explore the relationship between relationship-maintenance strategies and athlete burnout, including the potential mediating effects of the coach–athlete relationship and basic psychological needs satisfaction. Results: (1) Athletes’ relationship-maintenance strategies negatively predicted athlete burnout. (2) Besides the direct effect, we found evidence to support three mediation paths: (a) the coach–athlete relationship, (b) basic psychological needs satisfaction, and (c) both as serial mediators.

Therefore, several methods adopt random/uniform frame sampling or key-frame selection techniques. Unfortunately, most of the learnable frame selection methods are customized for specific models and lack generality, independence, and scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage video-to-video summarization method termed FastPicker, which can efficiently select the most discriminative and representative frames for better action recognition. Independently, the discriminative frames are selected in the first stage based on the inter-frame motion computation, whereas the representative frames are selected in the second stage using a novel Transformer-based model. Learnable frame embeddings are proposed to estimate each frame contribution to the final video classification certainty. Consequently, the frames with the largest contributions are the most representative. The proposed method is carefully evaluated by summarizing several action recognition datasets and using them to train various deep models with several backbones. The experimental results demonstrate a remarkable performance boost on Kinetics400, Something-Something-v2, ActivityNet-1.3, UCF-101, and HMDB51 datasets, e.g., FastPicker downsizes Kinetics400 by 78.7% of its size while improving the human activity recognition.",,10.1016/j.neucom.2022.10.037,18728286,231,Army Research Office,W911NF2110218,85143804559 (Scopus),09252312,,244,2023-01-07,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2022.10.037,Neurocomputing,516

We investigated pollen transfer between sympatric bat-pollinated Burmeistera species and their response to heterospecific pollen deposition from each other. Methods: We quantified conspecific and heterospecific pollen deposition for two populations of B. ceratocarpa, a recipient species in heterospecific pollen transfer interactions, that co-occur with different donor relatives (B. borjensis and B. glabrata). We then used a cross-pollination scheme using pollen mixtures to assess the species' responses to heterospecific pollen deposition in terms of fruit abortion and seed production. Results: Burmeistera ceratocarpa received significantly more heterospecific pollen from its relatives at both sites than its own pollen was deposited on its relatives. However, heterospecific pollen deposition only affected seed production by B. borjensis and B. glabrata, but not by B. ceratocarpa, suggesting that early acting post-pollination barriers buffer the latter against reproductive interference. Crosses between sympatric and allopatric populations suggest that the study species are fully isolated in sympatry, while isolation between allopatric populations is strong but incomplete. Conclusions: We did not observe evidence of reproductive interference among our study species, because either heterospecific pollen deposition did not affect their seed production (B. ceratocarpa) or they receive heterospecific pollen only rarely (B. borjensis and B. glabrata). Frequent heterospecific pollen deposition might favor the evolution of barriers against foreign pollen (as in B. ceratocarpa) that alleviate the competitive costs of sharing low fidelity pollinators with co-occurring species.",,10.1002/ajb2.16199,15372197,,,DEB‐1754802,85161904917 (Scopus),00029122,,,2023-01-01,,https://doi.org/10.1002/ajb2.16199,American Journal of Botany,

Dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT), an evidence-based treatment for complex transdiagnostic conditions presenting with high emotion dysregulation, may be beneficial to manage and mitigate the emotional and sensory aspects of chronic pain. Increasingly, DBT skills training as a key component of standard DBT is being delivered as a stand-alone intervention without concurrent therapy to help develop skills for effective emotion regulation. A previous repeated-measure single-case trial investigating a novel technologically driven DBT skills training, internet-delivered DBT skills training for chronic pain (iDBT-Pain), revealed promising findings to improve both emotion dysregulation and pain intensity. Objective: This randomized controlled trial aims to examine the efficacy of iDBT-Pain in comparison with treatment as usual to reduce emotion dysregulation (primary outcome) for individuals with chronic pain after 9 weeks and at the 21-week follow-up. The secondary outcomes include pain intensity, pain interference, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, perceived stress, posttraumatic stress, harm avoidance, social cognition, sleep quality, life satisfaction, and well-being. The trial also examines the acceptability of the iDBT-Pain intervention for future development and testing. Methods: A total of 48 people with chronic pain will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 conditions: treatment and treatment as usual. Participants in the treatment condition will receive iDBT-Pain, consisting of 6 live web-based group sessions led by a DBT skills trainer and supervised by a registered psychologist and the iDBT-Pain app. Participants in the treatment-as-usual condition will not receive iDBT-Pain but will still access their usual medication and health interventions. We predict that iDBT-Pain will improve the primary outcome of emotion dysregulation and the secondary outcomes of pain intensity, pain interference, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, perceived stress, harm avoidance, social cognition, sleep quality, life satisfaction, and well-being. A linear mixed model with random effects of individuals will be conducted to investigate the differences between the baseline, 9-week (primary end point), and 21-week (follow-up) assessments as a function of experimental condition. Results: Recruitment started in February 2023, and the clinical trial started in March 2023. Data collection for the final assessment is planned to be completed by July 2024. Conclusions: If our hypothesis is confirmed, our findings will contribute to the evidence for the efficacy and acceptability of a viable intervention that may be used by health care professionals for people with chronic pain.

Design/methodology/approach: In total, 381 managers representing 31 relationships participated in one-and-a-half-day partnership meetings, and the authors analyzed how the management components were implemented in each relationship compared to the recommendations in the Partnership Model. Findings: Managers did not differentiate types of partnerships which led to over-resourcing relationships with low potential and under-resourcing those with the highest potential for creating value. The principles of contingency theory and strategic fit were not used for managing relationships. Research limitations/implications: Contingency theory combined with the relationship view suggests that management components should not be implemented at the same level for all relationships, but in the 31 relationships studied different partnership types were not managed based on their potential. Practical implications: The research reinforces the need for a formal structure like the Partnership Model to establish joint goals for a relationship and guide management in implementation. Originality/value: Effective supply chain management depends on the ability of managers to differentiate among partnership types and fit relational mechanisms that are appropriate.

It is essential to extract a time-frequency (TF) characteristics in such signals for an accurate description. Two parameters are usually applied to quantify the TF characteristics of a nonstationary signal, i.e., instantaneous frequency (IF) and group delay (GD). A post-processing strategy was adopted by two recently developed techniques, the synchrosqueezing transform (SST) and the time-reassigned SST (TSST) to accurately capture the change rules of IF and GD respectively. However, due to the diversity of modes in complex nonstationary signals, no existing technique has been used to effectively estimate both IF and GD simultaneously. To solve this problem, a post-processing analysis technique termed as time-frequency-multisqueezing transform (TFMST) is proposed in this paper where a so-called chirp rate (CR) discrimination criterion is established by considering the Gaussian window in the short-time Fourier transform.

Despite this racialized shift in opioid availability, little research has examined how the spatial epidemiology of opioid overdose death has also shifted. The current study examines the differential geography of OOD by race and time (i.e., pre-fentanyl versus fentanyl era) in St. Louis, Missouri. Data included decedent records from the local medical examiners suspected to involve opioid overdose (N = 4420). Analyses included calculating spatial descriptive analyses and conducting hotspot analyses (i.e., Gettis-Ord Gi*) stratified by race (Black versus White) and time (2011–2015 versus 2016–2021). Results indicated that fentanyl era overdose deaths were more densely clustered than pre-fentanyl era deaths, particularly those among Black decedents. Although hotspots of overdose death were racially distinct pre-fentanyl, they substantially overlapped in the fentanyl era, with both Black and White deaths clustering in predominantly Black neighborhoods. Racial differences were observed in substances involved in cause of death and other overdose characteristics. The third wave of the opioid crisis appears to involve a geographic shift from areas where White individuals live to those where Black individuals live. Findings demonstrate racial differences in the epidemiology of overdose deaths that point to built environment determinants for future examination.

Method: A racially and economically diverse sample of mothers (n = 94; 39% African American, 52% White) of preterm infants (≤30 weeks of gestation) completed validated questionnaires assessing depression, anxiety (state and trait), NICU stress, and life stress at NICU discharge of their infant. Mothers reported on their own and their children's symptomatology at child age 5. A latent profile analysis was conducted to categorize maternal symptomatology. Results: Latent profile analysis yielded 4 distinct maternal profiles: low symptomatology, high NICU stress, high depression and anxiety, and high state anxiety. Social determinants of health factors including age, education, neighborhood deprivation, and infant clinical risk distinguished the profiles. Mothers in the high depression and anxiety profile reported more anxiety and life stress at follow-up and reported their children experienced more anxious/depressed symptoms. Conclusion: Existing literature has gaps related to examining multiple dimensions of NICU distress and understanding how patterns of mood/affective symptoms, life stressors, and related social determinants of health factors vary across mothers. In this study, one specific profile of maternal NICU distress demonstrated enduring risks for poorer maternal and child mental health outcomes. This new knowledge underscores sources of disparate health outcomes for mothers of preterm infants and the infants themselves. Universal screening is needed to identify at-risk dyads for poor health outcomes in need of individualized interventions that address both maternal and child well-being.

Family history of alcohol problems (FH) and impulsivity are well-documented risk factors for alcohol use outcomes, but no research has examined the role of organized sports participation in moderating these associations. This study examined the associations between FH, alcohol consumption and alcohol use disorder (AUD) symptoms, the role of UPPS-P (Urgency, Premeditation, Perseverance, Sensation Seeking, Positive Urgency impulsive behavior scale) impulsivity dimensions in mediating the association between FH and alcohol use outcomes, and whether these associations vary by students’ organized sports participation. Method: Participants (N = 3,959, 64.7% female, 51.8% White; Mean age = 18.48 years, SD =.40) were recruited from a large, public university and completed an online survey in the fall and spring semesters of their first year in college. Path analyses were conducted in Mplus. Results: FH was associated with higher levels of alcohol consumption and more AUD symptoms. Lack of premeditation, lack of perseverance, and negative urgency partially mediated the associations between FH and alcohol consumption and AUD symptoms. The association between negative urgency and AUD symptoms was stronger for organized sports participants. Conclusions: Impulsivity dimensions are risk factors for both alcohol consumption and AUD symptoms and serve as important pathways for the transmission of risk between generations.

Experiment 2 (N = 114) examined the role of confrontation in response to sexism, with women instructed to suppress confrontation during a sexist interaction exhibiting longer reaction times and lower ERN amplitudes.

Second, we explicitly account for the spatial distribution of ties, and find that it is not just local neighborhood ties that increase a sense of cohesion or informal social control, but that more spatially distant ties also matter.

Design/methodology/approach: Eleven challenges (variables) were identified after a comprehensive review of the existing literature. The contextual interactions among these variables were analysed from the perspectives of health-care stakeholders in two sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) countries (Nigeria and Uganda), using Delphi-interpretive structural modelling-cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification (MICMAC) techniques. Findings: The findings reveal that weak regulatory frameworks, insufficient information systems and a lack of necessary skills make it challenging for critical actors to perform the tasks effectively. The interaction effects of these challenges weaken organ supply chains and make it less efficient, giving rise to negative externalities such as black markets for donated organs and organ tourism/trafficking. Research limitations/implications: This paper establishes a solid foundation for a critical topic that could significantly impact human health and life once the government or non-profit ecosystem matures. The MICMAC analysis in this paper provides a methodological approach for future studies wishing to further develop the organ supply chain structural models. Practical implications: The study provides valuable insights for experts and policymakers on where to prioritise efforts in designing interventions to strengthen organ transplantation supply chains in developing countries.

The literature has largely focused on CV exposure among higher-risk, urban youth, while the impact of CV on emerging adults in university settings remains poorly understood, even though this developmental period is associated with heightened risk. Much of the extant research has utilized a cumulative approach to study CV, thus, little is known about how different dimensions of CV (i.e., direct, witnessed, learned about) may be uniquely related to functioning. Method: The goals of this study were to: (a) examine the associations between cumulative CV and both adverse (i.e., posttraumatic stress symptoms [PTSS], anger, emotion dysregulation) and adaptive (i.e., resilience) clinical outcomes and (b) investigate the distinct ties between the three CV dimensions and these constructs. This study included 547 emerging adults from two universities that are located in two U.S. cities with high crime rates (Mage = 20.31, SD = 2.08, range =18–28; 80.8% female; 57.8% white). Results: Cumulative CV was related to higher levels of PTSS as well as resilience. For the specific CV dimensions, direct CV was positively linked with PTSS, anger, and emotion dysregulation, whereas witnessed CV inversely corresponded with emotion dysregulation and resilience. Learning about CV was unrelated to clinical outcomes. Conclusions: Students in high crime areas are at heightened risk for CV, which may contribute to both psychological difficulties and resilience.

Method: This study utilized a descriptive observational design. Participants indicated what form of adverse reproductive events they had experienced (with options including infertility, miscarriage, stillbirth, premature birth, complicated pregnancy, and distress during delivery), and then completed the PCL-V regarding their experience with this event. These data were compared with a PCL-V normative sample using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) models. Results: Significant mean differences between the reproductive trauma groups and the normative group were found for at least one subscale (intrusion, avoidance, arousal, or changes in mood and cognition) for the infertility group, multiple miscarriages, stillbirth, complicated pregnancy, premature birth, and distress during delivery.

Yak1p deletion alters the half-life of Puf3p target mRNAs. Our findings outline a metabolism-driven regulatory switch, whereby, in mitochondria-independent conditions, Puf3p recruits Pop2p and the decay machinery to bound mRNAs for rapid decay.

A new class of monoclonal Aβ antibodies selectively targets and triggers deposition of Aβ protofibrils,-,-,-,-,-,-,https://doi.org/10.1111/jnc.15817,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85153370852,"amyloid-beta, conformation-selective, monoclonal antibody, protofibrils","Aggregation and accumulation of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) are a critical trigger for the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). While the plaques are the most outstanding Aβ pathological feature, much of the recent research emphasis has been on soluble Aβ species because of their diffusible, proinflammatory, and toxic properties. The focus on soluble aggregated Aβ species has also increased the interest in antibodies that are selective for different Aβ conformations. In the current study, we developed and characterized a new class of monoclonal antibodies (referred to as mAbSL) that are selective for Aβ protofibrils. Cloning and sequencing of the heavy and light chain variable regions for multiple antibodies identified sequence characteristics that may impart the conformational selectivity by the antibodies. Transfection of FreeStyle 293F cells with the plasmids permitted in-house expression and purification of mAbSL antibodies along with non-conformation-selective Aβ monoclonal antibodies (Aβ mAbs). Several of the purified mAbSL antibodies demonstrated significant affinity and selectivity for Aβ42 protofibrils compared with Aβ42 monomers and Aβ42 fibrils. Competition ELISA assays assessing the best overall antibody, mAbSL 113, yielded affinity constants of 7 nM for the antibody-Aβ42 protofibril interaction, while the affinity for either Aβ42 monomers or Aβ42 fibrils was roughly 80 times higher. mAbSL 113 significantly inhibited Aβ42 monomer aggregation by a unique mechanism compared with the inhibition displayed by Aβ mAb 513. Aβ42 protofibril dynamics were also markedly altered in the presence of mAbSL 113, whereby insoluble complex formation and protofibril deposition were stimulated by the antibody at low substoichiometric molar ratios. As the field contemplates the therapeutic effectiveness of Aβ conformation-selective antibodies, the findings presented here demonstrate new information on a monoclonal antibody that selectively targets Aβ protofibrils and impacts Aβ dynamics.

The relationships between these profiles and COS endorsement were then examined. A 4 class model emerged as the best fit: High CVE (5.0%), Low Support (16.7%), Moderate CVE and High Support (23.9%) and Low CVE (54.4%). Profiles significantly differed in relation to COS, with High CVE participants reporting the highest COS endorsement.

We investigated longitudinal posttraumatic dysfunction and amygdala functional dynamics following admission to an emergency department for new primarily nonsexual trauma in participants with and without previous ST. Methods: Participants (N = 2178) were recruited following acute trauma exposure (primarily motor vehicle collision). A subset (n = 242) completed magnetic resonance imaging that included a fearful faces task and a resting-state scan 2 weeks after the trauma. We investigated associations between prior ST and several dimensions of posttraumatic symptoms over 6 months. We further assessed amygdala activation and connectivity differences between groups with or without prior ST. Results: Prior ST was associated with greater posttraumatic depression (F1,1120 = 28.35, p = 1.22 × 10−7, ηp2 = 0.06), anxiety (F1,1113 = 17.43, p = 3.21 × 10−5, ηp2 = 0.05), and posttraumatic stress disorder (F1,1027 = 11.34, p = 7.85 × 10−4, ηp2 = 0.04) severity and more maladaptive beliefs about pain (F1,1113 = 8.51, p = .004, ηp2 = 0.02) but was not related to amygdala reactivity to fearful versus neutral faces (all ps > .05). A secondary analysis revealed an interaction between ST and lifetime trauma load on the left amygdala to visual cortex connectivity (peak Z value: −4.41, corrected p < .02). Conclusions: Findings suggest that prior ST is associated with heightened posttraumatic dysfunction following a new trauma exposure but not increased amygdala activity.

However, people living with HIV are at greater risk of experiencing cognitive impairment and reduced brain integrity despite well-controlled viremia. A robust literature supports exercise interventions as a method of improving cognition and structural brain integrity in older individuals without HIV. The effects of exercise on cardiometabolic, neurocognitive, and neural structures in middle-aged to older people living with HIV are less well known, with few prospective studies examining these measures. Objective: This prospective randomized clinical trial will examine the effects of a 6-month exercise training intervention compared to a 6-month stretching intervention (control) on cardiorespiratory fitness, physical function and strength, cognition, and neuroimaging measures of brain volumes and cerebral blood flow in people living with HIV. Methods: Sedentary middle-aged to older people living with HIV (ages≥40; n=150) with undetectable HIV viral load (<20 copies/mL) will be enrolled in the study. At the baseline and final visit, fasting plasma lipid, insulin, glucose, and brain neurotrophic factor concentrations; cardiorespiratory fitness; cognitive performance; brain volumes; and cerebral blood flow via a magnetic resonance imaging scan will be measured. Participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either the exercise or control stretching intervention. All participants will complete their assigned programs at a community fitness center 3 times a week for 6 months. A professional fitness trainer will provide personal training guidance at all sessions for individuals enrolled in both arms. Individuals randomized to the exercise intervention will perform endurance and strength training exercises, while those randomized to the control intervention will perform stretches to increase flexibility. A midpoint visit (at 3 months) will assess cognitive performance, and at the end point visit, subjects will undergo cardiorespiratory fitness and cognition testing, and a magnetic resonance imaging scan. Physical activity throughout the duration of the trial will be recorded using an actigraph. Results: Recruitment and data collection are complete as of December 2020. Data processing, cleaning, and organization are complete as of December 2021. Data analysis began in January 2022, with the publication of study results for primary aims 1 and 2 expected by early 2023. Conclusions: This study will investigate the effects of a 6-month aerobic and resistance exercise training intervention to improve cardiometabolic risk factors, cognitive performance, cerebral structure, and blood flow in sedentary people living with HIV. Results will inform clinicians and patients of the potential benefits of a structured aerobic exercise training program on the cognitive, functional, and cardiometabolic health status of older people living with HIV.

It proposes the emotional content of a mission statement moderates money spent and earned to ultimately to impact how much revenue a nonprofit makes through fundraising. Design/methodology/approach: The manuscript evaluates the qualitative turned quantitative data (via text mining [TM]) in mission statements from 200 nonprofits serving the homeless sector via a moderation analysis. After segmenting the sampled nonprofits by gross revenue, the authors analyze the impact of the positive and negative emotional tone in each group to determine how the content of a mission statement impacts organizational revenue. Findings: The paper provides empirical insights about how the emotional polarity of a mission statement influences money earned through fundraising. However, the positive and negative tone of a mission statement impacts organizations differently based on size. For nonprofits that report an annual revenue of less than $1 million, a positive tone in the mission statement results in higher revenue. Conversely, nonprofits that report over $1 million earn less revenue with a positive tone in their mission statement. Research limitations/implications: Owing to the specialized group sampled, the findings possibly only apply to the sampled group. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to test the relationships found in other areas of nonprofits. However, the implications of mission statement polarity influencing financial performance in any population should be of keen interest to practitioners when crafting mission statements. Practical implications: The finding that mission statement emotional tone influences the financial performance of a nonprofit has direct implications for the effective delivery of services in the nonprofit realm. Leaders of nonprofits can use the study’s findings to position their organizations to capture potential needed revenue in the crafting of their mission statements.

However, limited research has investigated the impact of childhood trauma on brain structure linked to later posttraumatic dysfunction. We investigated the effect of childhood trauma on white matter microstructure after recent trauma and its relationship with future posttraumatic dysfunction among trauma-exposed adult participants (n = 202) recruited from emergency departments as part of the AURORA Study. Participants completed self-report scales assessing prior childhood maltreatment within 2-weeks in addition to assessments of PTSD, depression, anxiety, and dissociation symptoms within 6-months of their traumatic event. Fractional anisotropy (FA) obtained from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) collected at 2-weeks and 6-months was used to index white matter microstructure. Childhood maltreatment load predicted 6-month PTSD symptoms (b = 1.75, SE = 0.78, 95% CI = [0.20, 3.29]) and inversely varied with FA in the bilateral internal capsule (IC) at 2-weeks (p = 0.0294, FDR corrected) and 6-months (p = 0.0238, FDR corrected). We observed a significant indirect effect of childhood maltreatment load on 6-month PTSD symptoms through 2-week IC microstructure (b = 0.37, Boot SE = 0.18, 95% CI = [0.05, 0.76]) that fully mediated the effect of childhood maltreatment load on PCL-5 scores (b = 1.37, SE = 0.79, 95% CI = [−0.18, 2.93]). IC microstructure did not mediate relationships between childhood maltreatment and depressive, anxiety, or dissociative symptomatology. Our findings suggest a unique role for IC microstructure as a stable neural pathway between childhood trauma and future PTSD symptoms following recent trauma. Notably, our work did not support roles of white matter tracts previously found to vary with PTSD symptoms and childhood trauma exposure, including the cingulum bundle, uncinate fasciculus, and corpus callosum.

Specifically, responses that are commonly associated with inaccurate reporting practices–particularly, the 0%, 50%, and 100% categories–can be treated as partially identified. By doing so, scholars are able to bound the effect of perceived arrest risk on criminality, which provides more credible, although less precise, estimates of β1. Scholars can use this approach to not only produce more defensible findings, on the whole, but also gain insight into the possible threat posed by measurement misspecification. Methods: Point estimates of a perceived certainty effect were elicited via Quasi-Poisson regression using data derived from the Pathways to Desistance study. These estimates were subsequently bounded under progressively weaker measurement assumptions by a series of hill-climb algorithms. Results: In nine out of seventeen total algorithms, the worst-case bound remained in the expected direction and was statistically significant. For as long as a relatively minor level of response inaccuracy is assumed, supportive conclusions can be drawn. Conclusions: Support for a certainty effect can be found under relaxed measurement assumptions, up to a point.

Progress has been hindered, we argue, by presumptions about nonverbal behavior that follow from both received wisdom and faulty evidence. In this article, we document four persistent misconceptions about nonverbal communication—namely, that people communicate using decodable body language; that they have a stable personal space by which they regulate contact with others; that they express emotion using universal, evolved, iconic, categorical facial expressions; and that they can deceive and detect deception, using dependable telltale clues. We show how these misconceptions permeate research as well as the practices of popular behavior experts, with consequences that extend from intimate relationships to the boardroom and courtroom and even to the arena of international security. Notwithstanding these misconceptions, existing frameworks of nonverbal communication are being challenged by more comprehensive systems approaches and by virtual technologies that ambiguate the roles and identities of interactants and the contexts of interaction.",,10.1177/17456916221148142,17456924,,,,85148448936 (Scopus),17456916,,,2023-01-01,,https://doi.org/10.1177/17456916221148142,Perspectives on Psychological Science,

Bobolinks (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) breed in grasslands across northern North America and migrate from their breeding grounds toward the eastern Atlantic Coast and then proceed through the Caribbean to South America. However, a small but regular number of Bobolinks have been recorded on the Galapagos Islands. We collected genetic samples from nine Galapagos Bobolinks and performed double-digest restriction site-associated sequencing. We compared them with samples from seven locations across their breeding distribution to determine their population of origin. Galapagos Bobolinks shared the genetic structure of a cluster in the eastern portion of the breeding range that includes New Brunswick and Ontario, Canada, and Vermont, United States. Genetic assignment tests largely corroborated this finding, although slightly different results were obtained for the two methods. All individuals were assigned to the Ontario breeding population using AssignPop, while Rubias assigned six of the migrants to Ontario and three to a Midwest breeding population. Low average relatedness among Galapagos individuals indicates that they are not more related to one another than to individuals within a breeding population and are therefore likely not from a single, small isolated population. Our results do not support the probability hypothesis—that Galapagos Bobolinks originated from the region that includes the greatest proportion of their breeding range (Great Plains)—or the vagrant hypothesis—that migrants are displaced onto Galapagos due to weather events.

Participants from the AURORA study (n = 283), a multisite longitudinal study of trauma outcomes, completed functional magnetic resonance imaging and psychophysiology within approximately two-weeks of trauma exposure. Seed-based amygdala connectivity and amygdala reactivity during passive viewing of fearful and neutral faces were assessed during fMRI.

Histopathological images have proven to be a reliable way to find out if someone has breast cancer over time, however, it could be time consuming and require much resources when observed physically. In order to lessen the burden on the pathologists and save lives, there is need for an automated system to effectively analysis and predict the disease diagnostic. In this paper, a lightweight separable convolution network (LWSC) is proposed to automatically learn and classify breast cancer from histopathological images. The proposed architecture aims to treat the problem of low quality by extracting the visual trainable features of the histopathological image using a contrast enhancement algorithm. LWSC model implements separable convolution layers stacked in parallel with multiple filters of different sizes in order to obtain wider receptive fields. Additionally, the factorization and the utilization of bottleneck convolution layers to reduce model dimension were introduced. These methods reduce the number of trainable parameters as well as the computational cost sufficiently with greater non-linear expressive capacity than plain convolutional networks. The evaluation results depict that the proposed LWSC model performs optimally, obtaining 97.23% accuracy, 97.71% sensitivity, and 97.93% specificity on multi-class categories.

Methods The Quality of Life and Aging with HIV in Rural Uganda study enrolled people with and without HIV aged over 49 from October 2020 to October 2021. We collected data on COVID-19-related stressors (behavior changes, concerns, interruptions in health care, income, and food) and the participants’ QOL. We used linear regression to estimate the associations between COVID-19-related stressors and QOL, adjusting for demographic characteristics, mental and physical health, and time before vs after the lockdown during the second COVID-19 wave in Uganda. Interaction between HIV and COVID-19-related stressors evaluated effect modification. Results We analysed complete data from 562 participants. Mean age was 58 (standard deviation (SD) = 7); 265 (47%) participants were female, 386 (69%) were married, 279 (50%) had HIV, and 400 (71%) were farmers.

The effectiveness of these molecules against various cancer cells has been reported in the literature. One major problem that prevents their practical application is the hemolytic nature of GA. The possibility of employing mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) to circumvent this problem is explored. Amino-functionalized MSN (MSN-NH2) coated with polydopamine (PD), and polyethylene glycol (PEG) were synthesized. The hemolytic activity of the nanoparticles (NP) was tested. PD and PEG-coated MSN showed no sign of hemolysis. Furthermore, the PEGylation of these MSN resulted in reduced phagocytosis. GA tomatine was loaded inside the pores of MSN-NH2. Thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) indicated a loading of 4.2%. The drug release profile of the DDS was tested at two different pH. A pH-dependent drug release with 3 times more tomatine being released at acidic pH of 5.5 compared to neutral pH of 7.4 was observed. The developed drug delivery system (DDS) showed a significant decrease in the hemolytic activity of tomatine. The effectiveness of the DDS was tested against human liver cancer (HepG2) cells and normal liver cells (THLE-3) between the concentration range of 0.4–12.7 μg mL−1 of tomatine loaded. Cell viability measurements demonstrated a comparable level of toxicity between the developed DDS and free tomatine. Further, the DDS was less toxic to normal cells at mid-range concentrations of 1.6 and 3.2 μg mL−1. The cancerous cells showed signs of late apoptosis.

We test this in bumble bees (Apidae: Bombus), a clade of eusocial insects that produce individuals at different time points across their reproductive season and exhibit organ developmental plasticity in response to nutritional consumption. To accomplish this, we develop a theoretical model that simulates learning development across a reproductive season for a colony parameterized with observed life history data. Our model finds two qualitative seasonal trajectories of learning: (1) an increase in learning across the season and (2) no change in learning across the season. We also find these two qualitative trajectories revealed by empirical learning data; the proportion of workers successfully completing a learning test increases across a season for two bumble bee species (Bombus auricomus, Bombus pensylvanicus) but does not change for another three (Bombus bimaculatus, Bombus griseocollis, Bombus impatiens).

To understand what drives range-size variation, we established an integrative framework focusing on two causal pathways: the amount of currently suitable habitat (ASH) and range filling (i.e., the occupancy of ASH). Instead of testing different hypotheses in isolation, we linked four hypotheses to this unifying framework: we tested the niche breadth and niche position hypotheses, which explain range-size variation via effects on ASH; we also tested the colonization ability and post-glacial migration lag hypotheses, which explain range-size variation via range filling. Location: The Americas. Time period: Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to present. Major taxa studied: One hundred and eighty-three oak species. Methods: We extracted locality records and measured range size as the area of occupancy (AOO) and extent of occurrence (EOO). We used Maxent models and current environmental layers to quantify ASH, niche breadth and niche position. We used seven phenotypic traits as proxies of colonization ability. We calculated post-glacial accessibility to currently suitable habitat, in addition to the proportion of currently suitable habitat covered by LGM ice sheets. Using structural equation models and regression models, we tested the four hypotheses. Finally, we examined how ASH and range filling contributed interactively to range-size variation by quantifying variance and covariance. Results: Our results supported all four hypotheses. Additionally, we found that variance in ASH and range filling contributed to a similar extent to variance in AOO, with almost zero covariance between ASH and range filling. In contrast, range filling accounted for almost all the variance in EOO, and we detected a significant negative covariance between ASH and range filling. Main conclusions: In oaks, factors associated with range filling are at least as important as niche properties in determining range size. Our framework is generalizable to other study systems for testing the contributions of two pathways, ASH and range filling, to range-size variation.",,10.1111/geb.13610,14668238,95,Whitney R.

We examined if the proportional abundance of these dispersal modes could be explained by the availability of dispersal agents (disperser-availability hypothesis) and/or the availability of resources for constructing zoochorous fruits (resource-availability hypothesis). Time period: Tree-inventory plots established between 1934 and 2019. Major taxa studied: Trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) ≥ 9.55 cm. Location: Amazonia, here defined as the lowland rain forests of the Amazon River basin and the Guiana Shield. Methods: We assigned dispersal modes to a total of 5433 species and morphospecies within 1877 tree-inventory plots across terra-firme, seasonally flooded, and permanently flooded forests. We investigated geographic patterns in the proportional abundance of dispersal modes. We performed an abundance-weighted mean pairwise distance (MPD) test and fit generalized linear models (GLMs) to explain the geographic distribution of dispersal modes. Results: Anemochory was significantly, positively associated with mean annual wind speed, and hydrochory was significantly higher in flooded forests. Dispersal modes did not consistently show significant associations with the availability of resources for constructing zoochorous fruits. A lower dissimilarity in dispersal modes, resulting from a higher dominance of endozoochory, occurred in terra-firme forests (excluding podzols) compared to flooded forests. Main conclusions: The disperser-availability hypothesis was well supported for abiotic dispersal modes (anemochory and hydrochory). The availability of resources for constructing zoochorous fruits seems an unlikely explanation for the distribution of dispersal modes in Amazonia. The association between frugivores and the proportional abundance of zoochory requires further research, as tree recruitment not only depends on dispersal vectors but also on conditions that favour or limit seedling recruitment across forest types.",,10.1111/geb.13596,14668238,49,"Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación (COLCIENCIAS)",INV‐2021‐128‐2268,85140360968 (Scopus),1466822X,1,69,2023-01-01,,https://doi.org/10.1111/geb.13596,Global Ecology and Biogeography,32

Pollinators with restricted mobility are predicted to limit gene flow within and among populations, whereas pollinators that fly longer distances are likely to promote genetic cohesion. These predictions, however, remain poorly tested. We examined population genetic structure and fine-scale spatial genetic structure (FSGS) in six perennial understory angiosperms in Andean cloud forests of northwestern Ecuador. Species belong to three families (Gesneriaceae, Melastomataceae, and Rubiaceae), and within each family we paired one insect-pollinated with one hummingbird-pollinated species, predicting that insect-pollinated species have greater population differentiation (as quantified with the FST statistic) and stronger FSGS (as quantified with the SP statistic) than hummingbird-pollinated species. We confirmed putative pollinators through a literature review and fieldwork, and inferred population genetic parameters with a genome-wide genotyping approach. In two of the three species pairs, insect-pollinated species had much greater (>2-fold) population-level genetic differentiation and correspondingly steeper declines in fine-scale genetic relatedness. In the Gesneriaceae pair, however, FST and SP values were similar between species and to those of the other hummingbird-pollinated plants. In this pair, the insect pollinators are euglossine bees (as opposed to small bees and flies in the other pairs), which are thought to forage over large areas, and therefore may provide similar levels of gene flow as hummingbirds. Overall, our results shed light on how different animal pollination modes influence the spatial scale of plant gene flow, suggesting that small insects strongly decrease genetic cohesion.",e3845,10.1002/ecy.3845,19399170,,University of Missouri-St. Louis,,85140089802 (Scopus),00129658,1,,2023-01-01,36224746.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.3845,Ecology,104

The two most cited SCM frameworks for services have methodological and conceptual deficiencies. Drawing upon the service-dominant logic of marketing and using an empirical research approach, we developed supply chain structure maps for nine service firms. Our findings indicate that the supply chain structure maps of service companies are comparable to those in the product-based literature, which supports the service-dominant logic. Then, we identified the six key processes that constitute a framework to manage service supply chains. The customer relationship management and the supplier relationship management processes form the critical links in the supply chain, and the other four processes are coordinated through this linkage.

Since one goal of this policy is to improve perceptions of safety, it is important to understand how arming teachers impacts students. Using survey data from six Midwestern school districts, we apply Ferraro’s risk assessment model to explore how individual and school conditions impact feelings of safety if teachers carry guns in school. We find perceived risk of victimization decreases feelings of safety if teachers are armed, which is driven by self-reported and vicarious victimization. Self-reported delinquency, in contrast, is directly related to feeling safer if teachers are armed.

Though independence negotiations in 1960 ended political multiracialism, in cultural arenas, white sports officials – and their conservative allies in the International Olympic Committee – continued drawing on multiracialist ideologies to justify their disproportionate influence as heads of Kenya's sports organizations and as coaches. Kenyan sport during the midcentury thus reveals the unevenness and incompleteness of decolonization, as well as the specific means by which white settlers attempted to maintain power in the independent era. These efforts can be seen as part of a broader, global right-wing backlash to African nationalism. Though white Kenyans attempted to clutch onto power within the world of sport, Kenya's independent state actors intervened, nationalizing the sports administration and sidelining white-dominated institutions. While recent scholarship has examined African decolonization as a contested process, much of this work has centered on the formal mechanisms of transition.

The defense cascade model posits that individuals respond to stressors by progressing through a series of defensive reactions, with nonresponders having advanced to a shutdown response. It remains unclear whether dissociation is at the end of a continuum of passive behavior, indicating full shutdown, or if it comprises a distinct response. The present study aimed to address this uncertainty, using EFA to compare a two-factor (active, passive) and three-factor (active, passive, dissociative) model of defensive responding. Eighty-nine female physical and sexual assault survivors reported their peritraumatic reactions within 1 month of their assault, which were entered into the EFA. The three-factor model was superior, suggesting dissociation is a distinct category of peritraumatic coping. Peritraumatic use of both passive and dissociative coping strategies were each significantly associated with ongoing use of passive coping and increased PTSD symptoms 1-month posttrauma; surprisingly, the use of passive peritraumatic coping strategies was a better indicator than peritraumatic dissociation. The inclusion of depression as a covariate removed the association of passive (but not dissociative) coping with PTSD symptom severity. Active coping use was not significantly associated with any outcome, suggesting that the presence of shutdown responses is more informative than the presence or absence of any active coping.

Methods: We analyzed Phase 8 (2016-2018) Pregnant Risk Assessment Monitoring System data for 82,603 respondents who recently gave birth to a live infant. Uptake of influenza (33 states) or Tdap (19 states) vaccines was compared for rural versus urban areas of participating states. We compared the prevalence of immunization for rural versus urban areas by indicators of health care access using average marginal predictive values from multivariable regression models. Findings: Although nearly half (48.2%) of pregnant women in rural areas relied on Medicaid to fund prenatal care, rural-residing women were less likely to live in a state offering full coverage under Medicaid to pregnant women than urban-residing women (93.9% vs 98.0%, respectively).

Relatively little research has examined which individuals with PTSD are most likely to exhibit sleep state misperception. This study explored clinical predictors of sleep state misperception in a sample of 43 women with PTSD and clinically significant sleep impairment. Method: During a baseline assessment, participants’ PTSD symptoms were assessed using a clinical interview and their sleep was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Objective sleep, self-reported sleep, and PTSD symptoms were then assessed over a 1-week period using actigraphy and daily diaries. Results: Consistent with previous research, women in the study exhibited total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE), and sleep onset latency (SOL) sleep state misperception. For TST and SE, but not SOL, discrepancies between actigraphy and the PSQI were associated with each clinician-rated PTSD symptom cluster, whereas discrepancies between actigraphy and daily diary were only associated with clinician-rated reexperiencing symptoms. The only self-reported PTSD symptom that was uniquely associated with sleep state misperception was nightmares. This association was no longer significant after controlling for sleep-related anxiety.

For example, an aha! experience followed by sudden solutions for insight problems can enhance the later long-term memory for such solutions. However, whether there is a superior memory of ideas generated in open-ended creative problems, such as the alternative uses task (AUT), is unknown. Here, we performed two studies through four experiments to investigate the superior memory in the AUT and assessed the relationship between factors related to ideas (i.e., the aha! experience, emotional feeling, subjective novelty, and source) and the recognition accuracy of ideas. By manipulating the number of generated ideas, the study examined whether the effect could be observed in the single-idea (Experiments 1 and 2) and multi-idea (Experiments 3 and 4) versions of the AUT. Study 1 showed that subjective novelty positively predicted the recognition likelihood of ideas, but the aha! experience and emotional feeling were non-significant factors (Experiment 1).

Though a cadre of all youth experience various problem behaviors such as delinquency, interpersonal violence, and substance use, multiracial adolescents appear to be at an increased risk. Early work suggests that this risk may be predicated upon their multiracial background becoming more salient during the already challenging developmental period of adolescence.

Because M. abscessus infections are a major cause of clinical decline and morbidity in CF patients, improving treatment and the detection of this mycobacterium in the context of a polymicrobial culture represents a critical component to better manage patient care. We report here the synthesis of fluorescent Dansyl derivatives of four active cyclipostins and cyclophostin analogues (CyCs) and provide new insights regarding the CyC's lack of activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, and above all into their mode of action against intramacrophagic M. abscessus cells. Our results pointed out that the intracellularly active CyC accumulate in acidic compartments within macrophage cells, that this accumulation appears to be essential for their delivery to mycobacteria-containing phagosomes, and consequently, for their antimicrobial effect against intracellular replicating M. abscessus, and that modification of such intracellular localization via disruption of endolysosomal pH strongly affects the CyC accumulation and efficacy. Moreover, we discovered that these fluorescent compounds could become efficient probes to specifically label mycobacterial species with high sensitivity, including M. abscessus in the presence several other pathogens like Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.

A public health approach has called for population-level assessment; however, identification of TIP victims lacks a standardised operational definition. This study applied the Prevalence Reduction Innovation Forum (PRIF) statistical definitions, developed by the US Department of State, to a community survey in Cape Town, South Africa. DESIGNS: A high-risk sampling strategy was used. TIP screening questions from two instruments were matched with PRIF domain indicators to generate prevalence estimates. Sensitivity, specificity and receiver operating characteristics analyses were conducted to assess the performance of the two screeners. SETTING: Cross-sectional survey conducted in Cape Town, South Africa, from January to October 2021. PARTICIPANTS: South Africans and immigrants from other nations residing in Cape Town and its surrounding areas, aged 18 or older, who met the study inclusion criteria for a set of experiences that were identified as TIP risk factors. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measures were PRIF lifetime and past 12-month TIP positivity. Secondary outcome measures included individual and summary measures from the two screeners. RESULTS: Our PRIF algorithm yielded a TIP lifetime prevalence rate of 17.0% and past 12-month rate of 2.9%. Summary measures from each TIP screener showed an excellent range of predictive utility. The summary screener measures yielded statistically significant differences among some demographic and background categories. Several screener items were shown less predictive of the PRIF statistical definition criteria than others. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence estimates of probable TIP were higher than those reported elsewhere. Our TIP screeners yielded an excellent range of predictive utility for the statistical definitions, promising the potential for wider applications in global and regional TIP research and policymaking.

Studying the mechanisms behind habitat divergence is fundamental to understanding niche partitioning, species diversification, and other evolutionary processes. Recent studies found that soil microbes regulate the abundance and diversity of plant species. However, it remains unclear whether soil microbes can affect the habitat distributions of plants and drive habitat divergence. To fill in this knowledge gap, we investigated whether soil microbes might restrict habitat distributions of closely related oaks (Quercus spp.) in eastern North America. We performed a soil inoculum experiment using two pairs of sister species (i.e., the most closely related species) that show habitat divergence: Quercus alba (local species) vs. Q. michauxii (foreign), and Q. shumardii (local) vs. Q. acerifolia (foreign). To test whether host-specific soil microbes are responsible for habitat restriction, we investigated the impact of local sister live soil (containing soil microbes associated with local sister species) on the survival and growth of local and foreign species. Second, to test whether habitat-specific soil microbes are responsible for habitat restriction, we examined the effect of local habitat live soil (containing soil microbes within local sister's habitats, but not directly associated with local sister species) on the seedlings of local and foreign species. We found that local sister live soil decreased the survival and biomass of foreign species' seedlings while increasing those of local species, suggesting that host-specific soil microbes could potentially mediate habitat exclusion. In contrast, local habitat live soil did not differentially affect the survival or biomass of the local vs. foreign species. Our study indicates that soil microbes associated with one sister species can suppress the recruitment of the other host species, contributing to the habitat partitioning of close relatives. Considering the complex interactions with soil microbes is essential for understanding the habitat distributions of closely related plants.",e9614,10.1002/ece3.9614,20457758,,University of Missouri,,85145393221 (Scopus),,12,,2022-12-01,,https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.9614,Ecology and Evolution,12

An accurate assessment of the prevalence of chronic dyspepsia, as well as of the effectiveness of population-based screening and eradication of H. pylori are warranted. Objectives: We determined the prevalence of H. pylori and chronic dyspepsia within the general adult population in a region of eastern Uganda. Independent predictors of H. pylori infection were assessed. Finally, we evaluated the efficacy of standard triple therapy on H. pylori eradication. Methods: Of 400 randomly selected adult residents in eastern Uganda, 376 were administered a validated, chronic dyspepsia questionnaire and provided a stool sample for H. pylori testing. H. pylori-positive participants were given standard triple therapy and monitored for medication adherence. The efficacy of triple therapy on H. pylori eradication was determined by fecal antigen testing after treatment. Log-linear and logistic regression analyses identified predictors of H. pylori positivity and eradication failure. Results: H. pylori prevalence within the study population was 48%. The prevalence of chronic dyspepsia was 87%. The presence or severity of dyspepsia did not predict H. pylori infection. However, a higher level of education was an independent predictor of H. pylori infection. Standard triple therapy resulted in ∼90% eradication. Missing at least four doses of any of the triple therapy medications over the 14-day course predicted eradication failure.

Minority stress theory posits that this association is explained by sexual orientation victimization, which acts as a stressor to impact depression. For those vulnerable to the effects of stress, victimization may worsen depression by altering activity in neural reward systems. This study examines whether neural reward systems moderate the influence of sexual orientation victimization, a common and distressing experience in SMY, on depression. Methods: A total of 81 participants ages 15 to 22 years (41% SMY, 52% marginalized race) reported sexual orientation victimization, depression severity, and anhedonia severity, and underwent a monetary reward functional magnetic resonance imaging task. Significant activation to reward > neutral outcome (pfamilywise error < .05) was determined within a meta-analytically derived Neurosynth reward mask. A univariate linear model examined the impact of reward activation and identity on victimization–depression relationships. Results: SMY reported higher depression (p < .001), anhedonia (p = .03), and orientation victimization (p < .001) than heterosexual youth. The bilateral ventral striatum, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), anterior cingulate cortex, and right orbitofrontal cortex were significantly active to reward. mPFC activation moderated associations between sexual orientation victimization and depression (p = .03), with higher depression severity observed in those with a combination of higher mPFC activation and greater orientation victimization. Conclusions: Sexual orientation victimization was related to depression but only in the context of higher mPFC activation, a pattern observed in depressed youth. These novel results provide evidence for neural reward sensitivity as a vulnerability factor for depression in SMY, suggesting mechanisms for disparities, and are a first step toward a clinical neuroscience understanding of minority stress in SMY.",,10.1016/j.bpsc.2022.08.009,24519030,1289,National Institute of Mental Health,R01MH104418-02S1,85143510264 (Scopus),24519022,12,1297,2022-12-01,36064188.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsc.2022.08.009,Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging,7

Maladaptive and adaptive subtypes of rumination contribute to distinct outcomes, with brooding worsening negative mood and reflection related to fewer depression symptoms in healthy populations. Neuroimaging studies have implicated several cortical midline and lateral prefrontal brain regions in rumination. Recent research indicates that blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal variability may be a novel predictor of cognitive flexibility. However, no prior studies have investigated whether brooding and reflection are associated with distinct patterns of BOLD signal variability in depression. We collected resting-state fMRI data for 79 women with different depression histories: no history, past history, and current depression. We examined differences in BOLD signal variability (BOLDSD) related to rumination subtypes for the following regions of interest previously implicated in rumination: amygdala, medial prefrontal, anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (dlPFC). Rumination subtype was associated with BOLDSD in the dlPFC, with greater levels of brooding associated with lower BOLDSD in the dlPFC, even after controlling for depression severity. Depression history was related to BOLDSD in the dlPFC, with reduced BOLDSD in those with current depression versus no history of depression.

The current study draws on interviews (N = 15) with juvenile justice and child welfare practitioners operating in the St. Louis Metropolitan, Missouri area to examine the practices of those serving dual system youth. The findings demonstrate how the siloed nature of juvenile justice and child welfare influences decision-making in a way that routinely ‘transfers dual system youth back and forth between the two systems.

Many broader contextual factors have received little attention including caregiver's trauma history and social support, father involvement, family functioning, and neighborhood satisfaction. The links between types of and cumulative maltreatment have also been inconsistent, and prior work has not always accounted for children's symptoms. Objective: The current study examined child, caregiver, family, neighborhood, and maltreatment factors in relation to past-year mental health service use among at-risk eight-year-old children.

Participants/setting/method: Eight hundred and forty-five eight-year-old at-risk children (48.3 % male; 59.5 % Black) from the Longitudinal Studies in Child Abuse and Neglect (LONGSCAN) were included. Results: A small portion of children (12.4 %) received psychological help in the previous year. Children's externalizing symptoms, residing with a non-biological caregiver, cumulative maltreatment and sexual and emotional abuse were associated with seeking psychological services, whereas physical abuse, neglect, and domestic violence exposure were not.

The current study utilizes a large-scale, multi-site, prospective study of trauma survivors presenting to emergency departments. Hypotheses tested whether elevated anxiety sensitivity in the immediate posttrauma period is associated with more severe and persistent trajectories of common adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae in the eight weeks posttrauma. Participants from the AURORA study (n = 2,269 recruited from 23 emergency departments) completed self-report assessments over eight weeks posttrauma. Associations between heightened anxiety sensitivity and more severe and/or persistent trajectories of trauma-related symptoms identified by growth mixture modeling were analyzed. Anxiety sensitivity assessed two weeks posttrauma was associated with severe and/or persistent posttraumatic stress, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, pain, and somatic symptoms in the eight weeks posttrauma. Effect sizes were in the small to medium range in multivariate models accounting for various demographic, trauma-related, pre-trauma mental health-related, and personality-related factors. Anxiety sensitivity may be a useful transdiagnostic risk factor in the immediate posttraumatic period identifying individuals at risk for the development of adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae.

This study assessed the nature of substance use among survivors of all types of human trafficking and identified treatment barriers and needs, as reported by human trafficking service providers in one Midwest major metropolitan area. Methods: Participants were purposively selected from agencies that served foreign-born and domestic-born survivors of human trafficking. The study interviewed fifteen key informants across 13 agencies directly serving survivors of trafficking. Results: Providers highlighted frequent use of alcohol and marijuana, as well as polysubstance use. They noted survivors' significant use of opioids, associated concerns regarding fentanyl-related deaths, and increased frequency of stimulant use. Barriers for addressing substance use problems with survivors included low self-perceptions of need, lack of available residential or inpatient treatment options, and prioritizing basic needs such as housing over substance use treatment. Conclusions: Results underscore how broader trends in substance use and overdose in a region can mirror substance use patterns and treatment needs of human trafficking survivors. Further, a need exists for broader substance use screening and low-barrier referral services to address emergent needs of survivors of trafficking.",108897,10.1016/j.jsat.2022.108897,18736483,,University of Missouri,,85139325384 (Scopus),07405472,,,2022-12-01,36215910.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2022.108897,Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment,143

However, no studies have compared rsFC of WM brain regions in participants with mTBI versus PTSD. We used resting-state fMRI to investigate rsFC of WM networks in U.S. Service Members (n = 127; ages 18–59) with mTBI only (n = 46), PTSD only (n = 24), and an orthopedically injured (OI) control group (n = 57). We conducted voxelwise rsFC analyses with WM brain regions to test for differences in WM network connectivity in mTBI versus PTSD. Results revealed reduced rsFC between ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC), lateral premotor cortex, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) WM regions and brain regions in the dorsal attention and somatomotor networks in both mTBI and PTSD groups versus controls. When compared to those with mTBI, individuals with PTSD had lower rsFC between both the lateral premotor WM seed region and middle occipital gyrus as well as between the dlPFC WM seed region and paracentral lobule. Interestingly, only vlPFC connectivity was significantly associated with WM performance across the samples. In conclusion, we found primarily overlapping patterns of reduced rsFC in WM brain regions in both mTBI and PTSD groups.

Structural covariance of the ventral visual stream predicts posttraumatic intrusion and nightmare symptoms: a multivariate data fusion analysis,OA,Gold OA,-,-,Green Final OA,-,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-022-02085-8,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85135549421,,"Visual components of trauma memories are often vividly re-experienced by survivors with deleterious consequences for normal function. Neuroimaging research on trauma has primarily focused on threat-processing circuitry as core to trauma-related dysfunction. Conversely, limited attention has been given to visual circuitry which may be particularly relevant to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Prior work suggests that the ventral visual stream is directly related to the cognitive and affective disturbances observed in PTSD and may be predictive of later symptom expression. The present study used multimodal magnetic resonance imaging data (n = 278) collected two weeks after trauma exposure from the AURORA study, a longitudinal, multisite investigation of adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae. Indices of gray and white matter were combined using data fusion to identify a structural covariance network (SCN) of the ventral visual stream 2 weeks after trauma. Participant’s loadings on the SCN were positively associated with both intrusion symptoms and intensity of nightmares. Further, SCN loadings moderated connectivity between a previously observed amygdala-hippocampal functional covariance network and the inferior temporal gyrus. Follow-up MRI data at 6 months showed an inverse relationship between SCN loadings and negative alterations in cognition in mood. Further, individuals who showed decreased strength of the SCN between 2 weeks and 6 months had generally higher PTSD symptom severity over time. The present findings highlight a role for structural integrity of the ventral visual stream in the development of PTSD. The ventral visual stream may be particularly important for the consolidation or retrieval of trauma memories and may contribute to efficient reactivation of visual components of the trauma memory, thereby exacerbating PTSD symptoms. Potentially chronic engagement of the network may lead to reduced structural integrity which becomes a risk factor for lasting PTSD symptoms.",321,10.1038/s41398-022-02085-8,21583188,,National Institute of Mental Health,K00MH119603,85135549421 (Scopus),,1,,2022-12-01,35941117.0,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-022-02085-8,Translational Psychiatry,12

Impulsive noise brings enormous difficulties for signal processing, especially for multicomponent non-stationary signal representation and separation. The synchrosqueezing transform (SST) is a time-frequency (TF) analysis method with high energy concentration and inverse transform. Although SST and its variants have been used for instantaneous frequency estimation and modes recovery in many applications, they are unable to represent the signals clearly under impulsive noise. In this paper, we model the impulsive noise with the α-stable distribution, which satisfies the generalized central limit theorem. Based on the short-time Fourier transform (STFT), we proposed the fractional lower-order SST with adaptive order and adaptive window for multicomponent signal separation with single-channel observation, called the adaptive window and fractional lower-order SST (AWO-SST). Moreover, we consider the 2nd-order phase transformation for AWO-SST and provide a component recovery method under adaptive parameters. The proposed method can be easily extended to the cases of the continuous wavelet transform, the S-transform, and other linear TF analysis methods.

Yet, owing to frequent placement changes, their treatment may be fragmented. Moreover, if foster children are unable to provide important information about their own health status, and the same cannot be obtained from their families of origin, the resulting incomplete and/or inconsistent health history puts them at risk for unrecognized problems and conflicting diagnoses. Paradoxically, foster parents and resource providers often request psychotropic medications for children and youth in their care as a means of managing their behaviors. The phenomenon of inappropriate polypharmacy arises due in part to the difficulties related to integrating trauma-informed principles into the care process. It is further exacerbated by the complexity of intersecting systems in which child welfare case workers need to communicate including foster and biological parents, social service agencies, and advocates. In this second paper, we report on the same intervention as that discussed in the first paper, focusing on the effectiveness of the live 2-hour face-to-face training for child welfare staff and the 3-month web-based curriculum for leadership personnel in improving the participants' trauma responsiveness. Research Questions: 1. What are the child welfare staff's perceptions of their own knowledge, attitudes, and communication behaviors associated with medications used to treat mental health symptoms and monitoring for side-effects of psychotropic medication use in children? 2. What is the level of trauma responsiveness among child welfare staff? Methodology and Participants: The ABC Medication Scale was employed to measure staff knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors associated with medications used to treat mental health symptoms before and after the intervention to determine if the training resulted in any improvements. Individual- and organizational-level trauma responsiveness was rated on a continuum of the Missouri Model: A Developmental Framework for Trauma-Informed Approaches. Artifacts of the web-based curriculum and qualitative interview data were analyzed by applying grounded theory methods. Findings/Results: There was a significant increase in The ABC Medication Scale scores following the training. The qualitative findings further revealed that majority of the participants rated themselves as “trauma aware” or “trauma responsive” on the Missouri Model, while indicating that their agencies could work harder to become more fully trauma-informed. As trauma-informed child welfare workforce that understands the complexity and advocacy requirements of psychotropic medication management is needed, further longitudinal research is required is to assess the training effects over time. In particular, the aim should be to establish (a) how knowledge and attitude shifts correlate with greater degrees of trauma responsiveness, and (b) if and how such trainings translate into improved systems of support.",,10.1016/j.apnu.2022.07.026,,68,University of Missouri-St. Louis,,85134949565 (Scopus),08839417,,73,2022-12-01,36428077.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apnu.2022.07.026,Archives of Psychiatric Nursing,41

It is further exacerbated by the complexity of intersecting systems in which child welfare case workers need to communicate, including foster and biological parents, social service agencies, and advocates. Yet, there is limited research about trauma-informed psychotropic medication management interventions for child welfare staff. This pilot study was conducted to evaluate a trauma-informed psychotropic medication management intervention and is reported in two manuscripts, pertaining respectively to the facilitators and barriers to learning, and perceived individual and institutional trauma responsiveness. The intervention comprised of a 2-hour-long training session for child welfare staff and a 3-month web-based curriculum for leadership personnel, aiming to increase their understanding of trauma-informed psychotropic medication management. In the first paper, we report on the facilitators and barriers to learning, grouped into three categories: teacher attributes, learner attributes, and situational factors. In the second paper, in addition to trauma responsiveness ratings, we also provide a detailed account of one participant's life experience and perceptions of the intervention provided, as an exemplar of the psychosocial facets of resilience. The ABC Medication Scale scores that measured staff knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors associated with medications used to treat mental health symptoms showed a significant change in scores following training. Based on these findings, we provide practical solutions to address situational factors that are worth considering when providing training for child welfare staff. Paper 1 abstract: the facilitators and barriers to learning about trauma-informed medication management: Given that foster care children experience many challenges that threaten their well-being, their physical and mental health needs tend to be greater than those of their peers who are not in foster care. However, owing to the transient nature of the foster care placements, as well as continuous changes in medical providers and counselors, the screenings, supportive interventions, and treatments they receive may be fragmented. This is particularly problematic when considering that many of these children are medicated as a means of managing their behavior. Moreover, children in foster care are also more vulnerable to having the medications and diagnoses accumulate due to frequent placement changes and lack of treatment continuity. Our research was guided by the question “What are the facilitators and barriers to learning about trauma-informed psychotropic medication management?” We developed an intervention to address the issue of inappropriate polypharmacy and examined the facilitators and barriers to learning using a mixed methods design. The facilitators to learning were instructor-specific (e.g., reputation, teaching style, capacity for selecting and implementing relevant resources), learner-specific (altruism, capacity to see personal relevance in the learning situation, desire for knowledge/competence, career advancement/recognition-seeking), and situational (immediacy/on-demand resources, reinforcement of pleasant learning experience). Barriers were largely situational (workload and family demands). Based on these findings, we provide practical strategies for addressing situational factors that are worth considering when designing training curricula aimed at child welfare staff.",,10.1016/j.apnu.2022.07.001,,35,University of Missouri-St. Louis,,85134765536 (Scopus),08839417,,42,2022-12-01,36428071.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apnu.2022.07.001,Archives of Psychiatric Nursing,41

However, the performance of traditional fault diagnosis technique solely depends on handcrafted features based on expert knowledge which is difficult to pre-design and has failed in several applications. Deep learning (DL) has achieved remarkable performance in hierarchical feature extraction and learning distinctive feature of dataset from related distribution. However, the challenge associated with DL models is that max-pooling operation usually leads to loss of spatial details during high-level feature extraction. Another concern is the low quality characteristics of 2D time-frequency image which is mostly caused by the presence of noise and poor resolution. This paper proposes a modified wavelet convolutional capsule network with modified enhanced super resolution generative adversarial network plus for fault diagnosis and classification. It uses continuous wavelet transform to convert raw data signals to 2D time-frequency images and applies super resolution generative adversarial technique to enhance the quality of the time-frequency images and finally, the convolutional capsule network learns the extracted high-level features without loss of spatial details for the diagnosis and classification of faults. We validated our proposed model on the famous motor bearing dataset from the Case Western Reserve University.

In this paper, we present a new and practice-oriented approach to combatting high medical supply costs by exploiting cost-saving opportunities hidden in complex hospital procurement contracts. We first propose a four-dimensional structure to capture the complex and diverse requirements in multi-tier contracts. We then formulate a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model to optimize procurement decisions while taking into account a number of real-world complexities, including complicated tier pricing schemes, physician preference items (PPIs), and asymmetric product substitutability. A process is then presented to identify cost-critical PPIs by quantifying their financial impacts. We apply our approach to four regional and nationwide health systems and obtain the following findings: (a) the proposed model presents a new opportunity to reduce hospital procurement costs by up to 35%; (b) the financial impact of a PPI can be quantified; (c) not all PPIs are responsible for inflating costs, with the impact of an PPI ranging from none to 13% on the total cost of a clinical product category; (d) the optimal number of suppliers varies, with some health systems benefiting from fewer suppliers while others better with a larger pool of suppliers; and (e) under the current contracting structure, reducing product variety does not necessarily decrease product acquisition costs, and the current contracts may not encourage product standardization for which hospitals have long been striving.",102713,10.1016/j.omega.2022.102713,,,,,85132780591 (Scopus),03050483,,,2022-12-01,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.omega.2022.102713,Omega (United Kingdom),113

And, if so, (2) is this body size structure the result of plasticity or adaptation? We additionally estimate genetic diversity, inbreeding, and colony density of these species—three factors that affect extinction risk.

Infection, in utero, causes microcephaly and later developmental and neurologic impairments. The impact of ZIKV infection on neurocognition in adults has not been well described. The objective of the study was to assess the neurocognitive impact of ZIKV infection in adult rhesus macaques. Methods: Neurocognitive assessments were performed using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) via a touch screen and modified Brinkman Board before and after subcutaneous ZIKV inoculation. Immune activation markers were measured in the blood and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) by multiplex assay and flow cytometry. Results: All animals (N = 8) had detectable ZIKV RNA in plasma at day 1 post-inoculation (PI) that peaked at day 2 PI (median 5.9, IQR 5.6–6.2 log10 genome equivalents/mL). In all eight animals, ZIKV RNA became undetectable in plasma by day 14 PI, but persisted in lymphoid tissues. ZIKV RNA was not detected in the CSF supernatant at days 4, 8, 14 and 28 PI but was detected in the brain of 2 animals at days 8 and 28 PI. Elevations in markers of immune activation in the blood and CSF were accompanied by a reduction in accuracy and reaction speed on the CANTAB in the majority of animals.

Methods: 388 people with HIV (PWH) with an average age of 46 (15.8) and median plasma CD4+ T-cell count of 555 copies/mL (79% virally suppressed) underwent cognitive testing and 3T neuroimaging. Demographics, HIV disease variables, and health comorbidities were recorded within three months of cognitive testing/neuroimaging. Hierarchical clustering was employed to identify cognitive phenotypes followed by ensemble machine learning to delineate the features that determined membership in the cognitive phenotypes. Hierarchical clustering identified five cognitive phenotypes. Cluster 1 (n=97) was comprised of individuals with normative performance on all cognitive tests. The remaining clusters were defined by impairment on action fluency (Cluster 2; n=46); verbal learning/memory (Cluster 3; n=73); action fluency and verbal learning/memory (Cluster 4; n=56); and action fluency, verbal learning/memory, and tests of executive function (Cluster 5; n=114). HIV detectability was most common in Cluster 5. Machine learning revealed that polysubstance use, race, educational attainment, and volumes of the precuneus, cingulate, nucleus accumbens, and thalamus differentiated membership in the normal vs. impaired clusters. The determinants of persistent cognitive impairment among PWH receiving suppressive treatment are multifactorial nature. Viral replication after ART plays a role in the causal pathway, but psychosocial factors (race inequities, substance use) merit increased attention as critical determinants of cognitive impairment in the context of ART. Results underscore the need for comprehensive person-centered interventions that go beyond adherence to patient care to achieve optimal cognitive health among PWH.

Aims: This study aimed to determine the efficacy of a continuity-of-care approach in reducing suicide attempts, ideation, and related hospital and emergency department (ED) visits among youth at high risk for suicide. Method: Data on suicidal ideation, attempts, and related hospital and ED visits were collected over a 6-month period for youth under age 25 (n = 376). One-way repeated measures ANOVA and Cochran's Q tests assessed change from intake at the 3- and 6-month follow-up. Results: Youth had significantly fewer suicide attempts and related hospital and ED visits at both 3- and 6-month timepoints. Suicidal ideation decreased to 52% from intake to 6-month follow-up. Limitations: This study lacked a comparison population to examine continuity-of-care versus treatment-as-usual. Furthermore, the study did not extend beyond 6 months, limiting the ability to assess the intervention's long-term effectiveness.

Hence, males and females may have different patterns of plumage coloration, a phenomenon known as sexual dichromatism. Because males tend to have more complex plumages, sexual dichromatism is usually attributed to female choice. However, plumage coloration is partly condition-dependent; therefore, other selective pressures affecting individuals' success may also drive the evolution of this trait. Here, we used tanagers as model organisms to study the relationships between dichromatism and plumage coloration complexity in tanagers with parasitism by haemosporidians, investment in reproduction and life-history traits. We screened blood samples from 2849 individual birds belonging to 52 tanager species to detect haemosporidian parasites. We used publicly available data for plumage coloration, bird phylogeny and life-history traits to run phylogenetic generalized least-square models of plumage dichromatism and complexity in male and female tanagers. We found that plumage dichromatism was more pronounced in bird species with a higher prevalence of haemosporidian parasites. Lastly, high plumage coloration complexity in female tanagers was associated with a longer incubation period.

These trust variables, in turn, are positively associated with the outcome variable of vaccine acceptance. A multi-group structural equation modeling analysis of survey data from 1008 U.S. adults suggested that trust in institutions and physicians were important for both White and Black Americans in whether they were vaccine accepting or hesitant, while trust in non-discrimination was important for Black Americans and trust in social media was important for White Americans.

However, their role in sharing these vector-transmitted blood parasites with resident avian host species along their migration flyway is not well understood. We studied avian haemosporidian parasites in 10 localities where Chilean Elaenia, a long-distance Neotropical austral migrant species, spends part of its annual cycle to determine local parasite transmission among resident sympatric host species in the elaenia's distributional range across South America. We sampled 371 Chilean Elaenias and 1, 818 birds representing 243 additional sympatric species from Brazilian wintering grounds to Argentinian breeding grounds. The 23 haemosporidian lineages found in Chilean Elaenias exhibited considerable variation in distribution, specialization, and turnover across the 10 avian communities in South America. Parasite lineage dissimilarity increased with geographic distance, and infection probability by Parahaemoproteus decreased in localities harbouring a more diverse haemosporidian fauna. Furthermore, blood smears from migrating Chilean Elaenias and local resident avian host species did not contain infective stages of Leucocytozoon, suggesting that transmission did not take place in the Brazilian stopover site. Our analyses confirm that this Neotropical austral migrant connects avian host communities and transports haemosporidian parasites along its distributional range in South America.

In research studies, it was shown that 5-membered loops are essential to the initiation of carbon nanotubes on catalyst particles. In addition to offering this experimental context, we present density functional theory (VASP) computer simulations suggesting that 5-member loops are more likely than 6-member loops in a solidifying carbon melt.

In an effort to improve the usefulness of NPG, a simple and robust method for the fabrication of hierarchical and bimodal nanoporous gold electrodes (hb-NPG) containing both macro-and mesopores is reported using electrochemical alloying and dealloying processes to engineer a bicontinuous solid/void morphology. Scanning electron microscopy (color SEM) images depict the hierarchical pore structure created after the multistep synthesis with an ensemble of tiny pores below 100 nm in size located in ligaments spanning larger pores of several hundred nanometers. Smaller-sized pores are exploited for surface modification, and the network of larger pores aids in molecular transport. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to compare the electrochemically active surface area of the hierarchical bimodal structure with that of the regular unimodal NPG with an emphasis on the critical role of both dealloying and annealing in creating the desired structure. The adsorption of different proteins was followed using UV–vis absorbance measurements of solution depletion revealing the high loading capacity of hb-NPG. The surface coverage of lipoic acid on the hb-NPG was analyzed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and reductive desorption. The roughness factor determinations suggest that the fabricated hb-NPG electrode has tremendous potential for biosensor development by changing the scaling relations between volume and surface area which may lead to improved analytical performance.

We previously reported that in response to heat stress, GAPC accumulated in the nucleus to modulate transcription and thermotolerance. Here we show a cellular and molecular mechanism that mediates heat-induced nuclear translocation of cytosolic GAPC in Arabidopsis thaliana. Heat-induced GAPC nuclear accumulation and plant heat tolerance were reduced in Arabidopsis phospholipase D (PLD) knockout mutants of pldδ and pldα1pldδ, but not of pldα1. These changes were restored to wild type by genetic complementation with active PLDδ, but not with catalytically inactive PLDδ. GAPC overexpression enhanced the seedling thermotolerance and the expression of heat-inducible genes, but this effect was abolished in the pldδ background. Heat stress elevated the levels of the PLD product phosphatidic acid (PA) in the nucleus in wild type, but not in pldδ plants. Lipid labeling demonstrated the heat-induced nuclear co-localization of PA and GAPC, which was impaired by zinc, which inhibited the PA–GAPC interaction, and by the membrane trafficking inhibitor brefeldin A (BFA). The GAPC nuclear accumulation and seedling thermotolerance were also decreased by treatment with zinc or BFA. Our data suggest that PLDδ and PA are critical for the heat-induced nuclear translocation of GAPC. We propose that PLDδ-produced PA mediates the process via lipid–protein interaction and that the lipid mediation acts as a cellular conduit linking stress perturbations at cell membranes to nuclear functions in plants coping with heat stress.",,10.1111/tpj.15981,1365313X,786,National Institutes of Health,R01GM141374,85138676181 (Scopus),09607412,3,799,2022-11-01,36111506.0,https://doi.org/10.1111/tpj.15981,Plant Journal,112

Biodiversity modelling is a key tool for the integration of these drivers and the predictions generated are essential, for example, for climate change forecast and conservation planning. However, the reliability of biodiversity models at the local scale remains poorly understood, especially in tropical species-rich areas, where they are required. We inventoried all woody plants with stems ≥ 2.5 cm in 397 plots across the Andes-Amazon gradient. We generated and mapped 19 uncorrelated biodiversity drivers at 90 m resolution, grouped into four categories: microclimatic, microtopographic, anthropic, and edaphic. In order to evaluate the importance of the different categories, we grouped biodiversity drivers into four different clusters by categories. For each of the four clusters of biodiversity drivers, we modelled the observed species richness using two statistical techniques (random forest and Bayesian inference) and two modelling procedures (including or excluding a spatial component). All the biodiversity models produced were evaluated by cross-validation. Species richness was accurately predicted by random forest (Spearman correlation up to 0.85 and explained variance up to 67%). The results suggest that precipitation and temperature are important driving forces of species richness in the region. Nonetheless, a spatial component should be considered to properly predict biodiversity. This could reflect macroevolutionary underlying forces not considered here, such as colonization time, dispersal capacities, or speciation rates. However, the proposed biodiversity modelling approach can predict accurately species richness at the local scale and detailed resolution (90 m) in tropical areas, something that previous works had found extremely challenging.

Nevertheless, within the same climatic regime, water availability is modulated by local topography and soil characteristics (hereafter referred to as local hydrological conditions), varying from saturated and poorly drained to well-drained and potentially dry areas. While these conditions may be expected to influence species distribution, the impacts of local hydrological conditions on tree diversity and composition remain poorly understood at the whole Amazon basin scale. Using a dataset of 443 1-ha non-flooded forest plots distributed across the basin, we investigate how local hydrological conditions influence 1) tree alpha diversity, 2) the community-weighted wood density mean (CWM-wd) – a proxy for hydraulic resistance and 3) tree species composition. We find that the effect of local hydrological conditions on tree diversity depends on climate, being more evident in wetter forests, where diversity increases towards locations with well-drained soils. CWM-wd increased towards better drained soils in Southern and Western Amazonia. Tree species composition changed along local soil hydrological gradients in Central-Eastern, Western and Southern Amazonia, and those changes were correlated with changes in the mean wood density of plots. Our results suggest that local hydrological gradients filter species, influencing the diversity and composition of Amazonian forests. Overall, this study shows that the effect of local hydrological conditions is pervasive, extending over wide Amazonian regions, and reinforces the importance of accounting for local topography and hydrology to better understand the likely response and resilience of forests to increased frequency of extreme climate events and rising temperatures.",e06125,10.1111/ecog.06125,16000587,,Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior,A1‐S‐34563,85137865788 (Scopus),09067590,11,,2022-11-01,,https://doi.org/10.1111/ecog.06125,Ecography,2022

Methods : Using 36 months of retrospective data collected from 778 incarcerated women, we estimate monthly within-person effects of four types of strain experienced in adulthood (i.e., negative life events and three forms of victimization) on respondent-initiated violence and serious drug use. Cross-level interactions assess the moderating “carryover” effects of childhood abuse and cumulative adversity. Results : Negative life events increased women's initiation of violence and serious drug use. Having a near violent experience was positively associated with violence, while violent conflict increased drug use. Experiencing both childhood physical and sexual abuse accentuated the effect of predatory victimization on violence, and physical victimization amplified the positive relationship between near violence and drug use. Unexpectedly, women who experienced childhood sexual abuse were less likely to use drugs after experiencing strain. The accumulation of adversity among abused women could not account for these moderating effects.

Much of the recent success in protein structure prediction has been a result of accurate protein contact prediction - a binary classification problem. Dozens of methods, built from various types of machine learning and deep learning algorithms, have been published over the last two decades for predicting contacts. Recently, many groups, including Google DeepMind, have demonstrated that reformulating the problem as a multi-class classification problem is a more promising direction to pursue. As an alternative approach, we recently proposed real-valued distance predictions, formulating the problem as a regression problem. The nuances of protein 3D structures make this formulation appropriate, allowing predictions to reflect inter-residue distances in nature. Despite these promises, the accurate prediction of real-valued distances remains relatively unexplored; possibly due to classification being better suited to machine and deep learning algorithms. Methods. Can regression methods be designed to predict real-valued distances as precise as binary contacts? To investigate this, we propose multiple novel methods of input label engineering, which is different from feature engineering, with the goal of optimizing the distribution of distances to cater to the loss function of the deep-learning model. Since an important utility of predicted contacts or distances is to build three-dimensional models, we also tested if predicted distances can reconstruct more accurate models than contacts. Results. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that deep learning methods for real-valued protein distance prediction can deliver distances as precise as binary classification methods. When using an optimal distance transformation function on the standard PSICOV dataset consisting of 150 representative proteins, the precision of 'top-all' long-range contacts improves from 60.9% to 61.4% when predicting real-valued distances instead of contacts. When building three-dimensional models we observed an average TM-score increase from 0.61 to 0.72, highlighting the advantage of predicting real-valued distances.",,10.1109/TCBB.2021.3115053,15579964,3586,,,85115761878 (Scopus),15455963,6,3594,2022-11-01,34559660.0,https://doi.org/10.1109/TCBB.2021.3115053,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics,19

Machine intelligence and data-driven approaches are envisioned to build future Edge-IoT systems that satisfy IoT devices' demands for edge resources. However, significant challenges and technical barriers exist which complicate the resource management for such Edge-IoT systems. IoT devices running various applications can demonstrate a wide range of behaviors in the devices' resource demand that are extremely difficult to manage. In addition, the management of multidimensional resources fairly and efficiently by the edge in such a setting is a challenging task. In this paper, we develop a novel data-driven resource management framework named BEHAVE that intelligently and fairly allocates edge resources to heterogeneous IoT devices with consideration of their behavior of resource demand (BRD). BEHAVE aims to holistically address the management technical barriers by: 1) building an efficient scheme for modeling and assessment of the BRD of IoT devices based on their resource requests and resource usage; 2) expanding a new Rational, Fair, and Truthful Resource Allocation (RFTA) model that binds the devices' BRD and resource allocation to achieve fair allocation and encourage truthfulness in resource demand; and 3) developing an enhanced deep reinforcement learning (EDRL) scheme to achieve the RFTA goals.

Methods A total of 483 AHI participants began ART during Fiebig I-V and completed follow-up evaluations for 144 weeks. CD4+, CD8+, and CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio trajectories were defined followed by analyses to identify associated risk variables. Results Participants had a median viral load (VL) of 5.88 copies/ml and CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio of 0.71 at enrollment. After 144 weeks of ART, the median CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio was 1.3. Longitudinal models revealed five CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio subgroups: group 1 (3%) exhibited a ratio >1.0 at all visits; groups 2 (18%) and 3 (29%) exhibited inversion at enrollment, with normalization 4 and 12 weeks after ART, respectively; and groups 4 (31%) and 5 (18%) experienced CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio inversion due to slow CD4+ T-cell recovery (group 4) or high CD8+ T-cell count (group 5). Persistent inversion corresponded to ART onset after Fiebig II, higher VL, soluble CD27 and TIM-3, and lower eosinophil count. Individuals with slow CD4+ T-cell recovery exhibited higher VL, lower white blood cell count, lower basophil percent, and treatment with standard ART, as well as worse mental health and cognition, compared with individuals with high CD8+ T-cell count.

HIV-induced damage to the gastrointestinal tract potentiates residual immune dysregulation in PWH receiving effective antiretroviral therapy. However, few studies among PWH have examined the relevance of microbiome-gut-brain axis: bidirectional crosstalk between the gastrointestinal tract, immune system, and central nervous system. Methods A narrative review was conducted to integrate findings from 159 articles relevant to psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) and microbiome-gut-brain axis research in PWH. Results Early PNI studies demonstrated that neuroendocrine signaling via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and autonomic nervous system could partially account for the associations of psychological factors with clinical HIV progression. This review highlights the need for PNI studies examining the mechanistic relevance of the gut microbiota for residual immune dysregulation, tryptophan catabolism, and oxytocin release as key biological determinants of neuropsychiatric comorbidities in PWH (i.e., body-to-mind pathways). It also underscores the continued relevance of neuroendocrine signaling via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, autonomic nervous system, and oxytocin release in modifying microbiome-gut-brain axis functioning (i.e., mind-to-body pathways). Conclusions Advancing our understanding of PNI and microbiome-gut-brain axis pathways relevant to depression, substance use disorders, and other neuropsychiatric comorbidities in PWH can guide the development of novel biobehavioral interventions to optimize health outcomes.

Married individuals completed a regulation task in which they viewed spouse, pleasant, and neutral pictures without regulation prompt as well as spouse and pleasant pictures that were preceded by regulation prompts. Event-related potentials were recorded, and self-reported infatuation, attachment, and marital satisfaction were assessed. Viewing spouse pictures increased infatuation, attachment, and marital satisfaction compared to viewing pleasant or neutral pictures in the no regulation condition. Thinking about positive aspects of the spouse and increasing positive emotions unrelated to the spouse did not increase infatuation, attachment, and marital satisfaction any further. Motivated attention, measured by the LPP amplitude, was greatest to spouse pictures, intermediate to pleasant pictures, and minimal to neutral pictures. Although the typical up-regulation effect on the LPP amplitude was observed for pleasant pictures, positively reappraising the spouse did not increase the LPP amplitude and hence motivated attention to the spouse any further.

Traditionally, a single spin-phonon coupling constant is used to characterize how effectively the lattice can affect the spin, but it is hardly enough to capture novel electromagnetic behaviors to the full extent. Here, we introduce a concept of spin-phonon dispersion to project the spin moment change along the phonon crystal momentum direction, so the entire spin change can be mapped out. Different from the phonon dispersion, the spin-phonon dispersion has both positive and negative frequency branches even in the equilibrium ground state, which correspond to the spin enhancement and spin reduction, respectively. Our study of bcc Fe and hcp Co reveals that the spin force matrix, that is, the second-order spatial derivative of spin moment, is similar to the vibrational force matrix, but its diagonal elements are smaller than the off-diagonal ones. This leads to the distinctive spin-phonon dispersion. The concept of spin-phonon dispersion expands the traditional Elliott-Yafet theory in nonmagnetic materials to the entire Brillouin zone in magnetic materials, thus opening the door to excited states in systems such as CoF2 and NiO, where a strong spin-lattice coupling is detected in the THz regime.",375802,10.1088/1361-648X/ac7f17,1361648X,,U.S. Department of Energy,DE-FG02-06ER46304,85134429760 (Scopus),09538984,37,,2022-09-14,35793694.0,https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-648X/ac7f17,Journal of Physics Condensed Matter,34

A small collection of genes has been linked to Parkinson's disease including LRRK2, SAT1, and SNCA, the latter of which encodes the protein alpha-synuclein that aggregates in Lewy bodies as a hallmark of the disease. Overexpression of even wild-type versions of these genes can lead to pathogenesis, yet the regulatory mechanisms that control protein production of the genes are not fully understood. Pumilio proteins belong to the highly conserved PUF family of eukaryotic RNA-binding proteins that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression through binding conserved motifs in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of mRNA targets known as PUF Recognition Elements (PREs). The 3'UTRs of LRRK2, SNCA and SAT1 each contain multiple putative PREs. Knockdown (KD) of the two human Pumilio homologs (Pumilio 1 and Pumilio 2) in a neurodegenerative model cell line, SH-SY5Y, resulted in increased SNCA and LRRK2 mRNA, as well as alpha-synuclein levels, suggesting these genes are normally repressed by the Pumilio proteins. Some studies have indicated a relationship between Pumilio and microRNA activities on the same target, especially when their binding sites are close together. LRRK2, SNCA, and SAT1 each contain several putative microRNA-binding sites within the 3'UTR, some of which reside near PREs. Small RNA-seq and microRNA qPCR assays were performed in both wild type and Pumilio KD SH-SY5Y cells to analyze global and differential microRNA expression. One thousand four hundred and four microRNAs were detected across wild type and Pumilio KD cells. Twenty-one microRNAs were differentially expressed between treatments, six of which were previously established to be altered in Parkinson's disease patient samples or research models. Expression of ten miRs predicted to target LRRK2 and SNCA was verified by RT-qPCR.

Exclusion criteria were hospital admission, persons reporting any non-medical opioid use (e.g., opioids without prescription or taking more than prescribed for euphoria) in the 30 days before enrollment, and missing or incomplete data regarding opioid exposure or pain. We used multivariable logistic regression to assess the relationship between ED opioid exposure and at-risk opioid use, defined as any self-reported non-medical opioid use after initial ED encounter or prescription opioid use at 3-months.

Findings highlight discrepancies in how these two groups frame the utility of racial diversity in policing, revealing conflicting epistemologies of race and racism. Police draw on an epistemology of racial ignorance (Mills 1997, 2007, 2015) to selectively accommodate race-conscious critique while denying the history and power dynamics between the institution and minority communities. Conversely, black women civilians, grounded in a standpoint epistemology (Collins, 1986, 2009), emphasize the historical roots of policing, along with collective memories, and lived experiences to understand the relationship between the institution and minority communities.

Determining whether trauma-related dissociation is uniquely predictive of later outcomes would enable early identification of at-risk trauma populations. The authors conducted the largest prospective longitudinal biomarker study of persistent dissociation to date to determine its predictive capacity for adverse psychiatric outcomes following acute trauma. Methods: All data were part of the Freeze 2 data release from the Advancing Understanding of Recovery After Trauma (AURORA) study. Study participants provided self-report data about persistent derealization (N51,464), a severe type of dissociation, and completed a functional MRI emotion reactivity task and resting-state scan 2 weeks posttrauma (N5145). Three-month follow-up reports were collected of posttraumatic stress, depression, pain, anxiety symptoms, and functional impairment. Results: Derealization was associated with increased ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activation in the emotion reactivity task and decreased resting-state vmPFC connectivity with the cerebellum and orbitofrontal cortex. In separate analyses, brain-based and self-report measures of persistent derealization at 2 weeks predicted worse 3-month posttraumatic stress symptoms, distinct from the effects of childhood maltreatment history and current posttraumatic stress symptoms. Conclusions: The findings suggest that persistent derealization is both an early psychological and biological marker of worse later psychiatric outcomes. The neural correlates of trauma-related dissociation may serve as potential targets for treatment engagement to prevent posttraumatic stress disorder.

In particular, there is interest in the group of soluble oligomeric prefibrillar Aβ species comprising lower molecular weight oligomers up to larger protofibrils. In the current study, a number of strategies were utilized to separate Aβ protofibrils and oligomers and show that the smaller Aβ oligomers have a much different conformation than Aβ protofibrils. The differences were consistent for both Aβ40 and Aβ42. Protofibrils bound thioflavin T to a greater extent than oligomers, and were highly enriched in β-sheet secondary structure. Aβ oligomers possessed a more open structure with significant solvent exposure of hydrophobic domains as determined by tryptophan fluorescence and bis-ANS binding, respectively. The protofibril-selective antibody AbSL readily discerned conformational differences between protofibrils and oligomers. The more developed structure for Aβ protofibrils ultimately proved critical for provoking the release of tumor necrosis factor α from microglial cells. The findings demonstrated a dependency on β-sheet structure for soluble Aβ aggregates to cause a microglial inflammatory response.

Materials: The study includes 32 mandibles and 44 maxillae consisting of 485 teeth and 1052 tooth sockets. It includes 14 Egyptian texts on dental treatments. Methods: Human remains were observed macroscopically for carious lesions and antemortem tooth loss. Egyptian texts were translated from photographs. Results: 11 % of teeth were lost antemortem and 42 % of maxillae and mandibles had one or more teeth lost antemortem. One possible dental extraction is presented.

However, little is known about their domestic trade, which is often overlooked in estimates of trafficking. Peruvian law prohibits the unauthorized trade and possession of wildlife, but illegal sales are common in urban markets. To describe the dynamics, diversity, and composition of this illegal trade, we surveyed live wildlife for sale in urban markets in 16 Peruvian departments from 2007 to 2012. We identified the main hotspots of market trafficking, detected 193 species being sold alive, and estimate that 0.35–1.25 million animals were trafficked in this period. Iquitos, Lima, Pucallpa, and Tumbes were the most active and diverse trafficking nodes. Amazonian cities trafficked mostly local species, whereas in other cities the proportion of local species varied significantly (39–67%). Species dissimilarity across cities was high and correlated with their distance along trafficking routes. To assess if the market-based trade was representative of the national trade, we compared species richness in markets with that of country-wide confiscations. At least 430 species were confiscated in Peru between 2001 and 2019, but only 50% of species overlapped with markets in the same cities and period of our surveys. Our data suggest that urban markets are connected in a structured network that provides consumers with a diverse selection of species from across the country.

Species richness, phylogenetic diversity, and chemical diversity all influence the ability of insect herbivores to find and utilize their hosts. The relative impact of these components of diversity on species coexistence and plant–herbivore interactions is not well understood. We constructed 60 local communities of up to 13 species of Piper (Piperaceae) in native, mature forest at a lowland wet forest location in Costa Rica. The species composition of each community was chosen such that species richness, phylogenetic diversity, and GCMS-based chemical diversity were varied independently among communities. We predicted that chemical diversity would most strongly affect the communities across time, with smaller effects of taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity. At 13 months after the experimental planting, we assessed survivorship of each cutting, measured total leaf area loss of the survivors, leaf area loss to generalist and specialist herbivorous insect species, and local extinction of species. Generalist and specialist herbivory decreased with increasing levels of species richness and phylogenetic diversity, respectively. Surprisingly, there was no independent effect of chemical diversity on any of the three measures of herbivore damage. Nevertheless, plots with a higher chemical and phylogenetic diversity showed decreased plant mortality and local species extinction. Overall, our results suggested that both chemical and phylogenetic similarity are important factors in the assembly and maintenance of tropical plant communities.

Since the range and endurance of drones is limited, we consider here that the length of each route is constrained to a given limit L. Drones are not restricted to travel on the network, and they can enter and exit a line through any of its points, servicing only a portion of that line. Therefore, shorter solutions are obtained with “aerial” drones than with “ground” vehicles that are restricted to the network. If a LC K–DRPP instance is digitized by approximating each line with a polygonal chain, and it is assumed that drones can only enter and exit a line through the points of the chain, an instance of the Length Constrained K–vehicles Rural Postman Problem (LC K–RPP) is obtained. This is a discrete arc routing problem, and therefore can be solved with combinatorial optimization techniques. However, when the number of points in each polygonal chain is very large, the LC K–RPP instance can be so large that it is very difficult to solve, even for heuristic algorithms. Therefore, it is necessary to implement a procedure that generates smaller LC K–RPP instances by approximating each line by a few but “significant” points and segments. In this paper, we present a new formulation for the LC K–RPP with two binary variables for each edge and each drone representing the first and second traversals of the edge, respectively. We make a polyhedral study of the set of solutions of a relaxed formulation and prove that several families of inequalities induce facets of the polyhedron. We design and implement a branch–and–cut algorithm for the LC K–RPP that incorporates the separation of these inequalities. This B &C is the main routine of an iterative algorithm that, by solving a LC K–RPP instance at each step, finds good solutions for the original LC K–DRPP.

Theory of adaptive forgetting and remembering posits that memory should reflect the environment, with more valuable information remembered for longer amounts of time. Theory on biological preparedness predicts that rates of reliability through evolutionary time should influence what is learned and remembered. We use these ideas to predict that differential memory use will reflect the underlying value of the information being learned. We test this by comparing the learning and memory of social information versus floral information in foraging bumble bees. Bumble bees are extremely flexible in their use of both types of information and evidence suggests that social information is “special,” reflecting biological preparedness. Our experiment tests how bumble bees learn and remember social and floral information when their reliabilities, and thus value, differ. We find that bees learn both types of information at a similar speed. Bees show a decrement of memory of the trained associations in both treatments, but retain trained socially reliable information for longer, at both 4-hour and 8-hour retention intervals. Both training treatments influence whether bees match or avoid the locations of demonstrators, and this interacts with retention interval. Bees trained under reliable floral cues and unreliable social cues avoid conspecifics after 8-hr and 24-hr retention intervals. Bees thus learn about the reliability or unreliability of social cues and use this to modify their choices across time.",,10.3758/s13420-022-00528-2,15434508,317,University of Missouri,,85130715634 (Scopus),15434494,3,328,2022-09-01,35618984.0,https://doi.org/10.3758/s13420-022-00528-2,Learning and Behavior,50

Our focus is on omnichannel retailers who carry a single product category. A profit maximizing mixed integer linear programming model (MILP) is presented to determine the optimal locations and capacities of omnichannel warehouses, and the product flows from suppliers to warehouses, warehouses to the stores, and warehouses and stores to online markets. The online demand earned by the firm in each market is determined endogenously in the model as a function of the shipping time (distance) and the level of competition in the online market. Different warehouse capacities capture economies-of-scale in operating costs. To cover a wide range of different products, computational results are presented for five product categories, each considered separately, with widely differing cost characteristics. Results show that the ship-from-warehouse design generates greater profit than ship-from store for four product categories.

Specifically, networks between neighborhoods in where people commute to work and their spatial distributions may provide insight into patterns of joblessness because they represent the economic structure between neighborhoods. We argue that the network of neighborhoods provides insight into the competition people on parole face in the labor market, their spatial mismatch from jobs, as well as their structural support. Methods: We use data from people on parole released in Texas from 2006 to 2010 and create a network between all census tracts in Texas based on commuting ties from home to work. We estimate a series of multilevel models examining how network structures are related to joblessness. Results: The findings indicate that the structural position of neighborhoods has consequences for people on parole’s joblessness. Higher outdegree, reflecting neighborhoods with more outgoing ties to other neighborhoods, was consistently associated with less joblessness, while higher indegree, reflecting neighborhoods with more incoming ties into the neighborhood, was associated with more joblessness, particularly for Black and Latino people on parole. There was also some evidence of differences depending on geographic scale.

This study examined a culturally modified NeuroScreen, a tablet-based neurocognitive testing app, for use in Thailand. Construct validity was examined among Thai AYA (13–23 years) with and without PHIV. Method: NeuroScreen underwent adaptation including language, content, and usability review by Thai psychologists, AYA, and clinical staff. One hundred Thai AYA (50 PHIV; 50 HIV-uninfected, matched controls) were administered the adapted NeuroScreen and a battery of traditional paper-and-pencil neuropsychological tests. Correlations, mean differences, and proportions with impaired performance were examined across NeuroScreen and the traditional tests. Results: The Thai version of NeuroScreen was deemed understandable and culturally appropriate.A large correlation (.82) between overall performance on the NeuroScreen and traditional batteries was observed. Small-to-large correlations were found between conceptually similar NeuroScreen and traditional tests of processing speed, working memory, motor speed, and executive functioning. Mean test performance differences between AYA with PHIV and controls were similar between test batteries. Both sets of tests identified similar rates of impaired participants.

In this article, we develop a bat-bug agent-based modeling simulation for chain coding and employ it in compressing bi-level image information. The system consists of agents that are classified into static and dynamic depending on their movements. Bugs are considered static agents, and they are distributed over the virtual environment according to the allocation of pixels in the original image. On the other hand, bats are dynamic agent, and their role is to move around to consume bugs while the algorithm tracks their movements. Bats are designed in a way to move within certain boundaries to avoid crashing into each other. Bats employ specific movements that allow them to move in relative directions. Therefore, the frequency of their movements can follow a certain pattern that can help in further size reduction. In other words, the integration of relative movements into our design proved to be advantageous because there is an observable pattern of repeated movements, which allows getting higher compression results. Finally, arithmetic coding is applied to the final strings that represent the movements of bats while searching for bugs to eat. To assess the performance of the algorithm, we compared the findings against standardized benchmarks used in the image processing community: G3, G4, JBIG1, and JBIG2. The outcomes show that we could outperform all these benchmarks using all the images we used for testing.

Further, we find that while hardware configuration similarity between two instances is positively related to spot instance substitution, this substitution effect along hardware configuration is moderated by similarity along hardware capacity and location (zone). Our work contributes to the literature on cloud spot market by providing empirical evidence of the substitution effect among similar spot resources within a region, and thus help in understanding the choices of consumers in this market. We conclude by discussing how practitioners can leverage these findings in the procurement of computing resources from cloud spot market.",113815,10.1016/j.dss.2022.113815,,,,,85131796810 (Scopus),01679236,,,2022-08-01,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dss.2022.113815,Decision Support Systems,159

Both Rietveld refinement and pair distribution function (PDF) refinement of the X-ray scattering data indicated that the crystal structure of the metal lattice was a face centered cubic (FCC) structure and no difference between their local structure and average structure was observed. Rietveld refinement of neutron scattering data showed that the crystal structure was a CaF2 structure. However, the CaF2 structure model did not reproduce the first peak corresponding to the metal-hydrogen correlation in neutron PDF patterns. When special quasi-random structure (SQS) models based on the CaF2 structure are applied for the refinements, the SQS structure model, relaxed via first-principles calculations, reproduced the whole neutron PDF pattern. Distribution of interatomic distances between hydrogen and metal atoms in the relaxed SQS models showed that interatomic distance of hydrogen with Cr was shorter than that with V and that with Ti was longer than that with V, independently of the chemical compositions. The combination of neutron PDF and first-principles calculations with the SQS models revealed that hydrogen atoms did not occupy the center of tetrahedron but moved toward Cr atoms and away from Ti.",118055,10.1016/j.actamat.2022.118055,,,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology",2013B-E21,85131092788 (Scopus),13596454,,,2022-08-01,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actamat.2022.118055,Acta Materialia,234
Size matters: DNA binding site kinetics as a function of polyamide size,-,-,-,-,-,-,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2022.04.010,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85129389440,"Antiviral, Fluorescence, Kinetics, Polyamide","Hairpin polyamides (PAs) are remarkable minor groove-binding DNA ligands that demonstrate high affinity and sequence selectivity. Following extensive studies of 6–8 ring hairpin PAs have been more recent descriptions of larger PAs (14 rings or more) and their distinguishing properties and biological activities. However, there are no comparative kinetic studies of PA DNA binding behaviors over a range of PA sizes, making it difficult to understand important structure-activity relationships related to PA size. Described herein is the first comparative kinetic study as a function of hairpin PA size that examines the complexities of PA-DNA binding behaviors with unprecedented detail. DNA binding kinetics of PAs with 6 (PA6) and 20 (PA20) rings are extensively characterized by fluorescence spectroscopy, and the properties compared with those of 8 and 14 ring hairpin PAs. PA6 has a 1:1 binding site stoichiometry but exhibits biphasic association kinetics, consistent with populating more than one binding mode. One decay constant is at the diffusion controlled limit, and the other is 400-fold slower. In contrast, PA20 has high binding site stoichiometry (2.5:1) but displays a much simpler association kinetic trace with a decay constant of 1e6 M−1s−1. Due to the variability and complexity of association kinetics, it is difficult to identify trends in this behavior as a function of PA size. However, even though hairpin PAs of 8 or more rings bind DNA with similar affinities, residence times increase as PA size increases, ranging from 20 s to over 2500 s. Particularly compelling is that the antiviral PA20 shows little to no dissociation from DNA when challenged with competitor DNA, suggesting that high residence times are important for this biological activity.",,10.1016/j.biochi.2022.04.010,61831638,123,,,85129389440 (Scopus),03009084,,129,2022-08-01,35472565.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2022.04.010,Biochimie,199

Methods: Web-based self-report surveys administered to 20,842 incoming college students from nine countries (response rate 45.6%) assessed lifetime suicidal ideation, plans and attempts along with seven CAs: parental psychopathology, three types of abuse (emotional, physical, sexual), neglect, bully victimization, and dating violence. Logistic regression estimated individual- and population-level associations using CA operationalizations for type, number, severity, and frequency. Results: Associations of CAs with lifetime ideation and the transition from ideation to plan were best explained by the exact number of CA types (OR range 1.32–52.30 for exactly two to seven CAs). Associations of CAs with a transition to attempts were best explained by the frequency of specific CA types (scaled 0–4). Attempts among ideators with a plan were significantly associated with all seven CAs (OR range 1.16–1.59) and associations remained significant in adjusted analyses with the frequency of sexual abuse (OR = 1.42), dating violence (OR = 1.29), physical abuse (OR = 1.17) and bully victimization (OR = 1.17). Attempts among ideators without plan were significantly associated with frequency of emotional abuse (OR = 1.29) and bully victimization (OR = 1.36), in both unadjusted and adjusted analyses. Population attributable risk simulations found 63% of ideation and 30–47% of STB transitions associated with CAs.

Many factors are associated with parent relationships including severity of autistic behaviors and social support. This study aimed to investigate whether severity of autistic behaviors, perceived family support, and complementarity of interpersonal styles between husbands and wives predicted couple satisfaction among the parents of children with ASD. Method: Seven hundred ninety-seven parent dyads of children aged 7–14 years old with ASD participated in the study. Measurements used included couple satisfaction index, perceived family support using the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, inter-personal style using the inventory of interpersonal problems, the ABC autism checklists as well as sociodemographic and related factors. The Actor Partner Interdependence Model estimated by multilevel modeling was used for analysis. Results: Perceived family support was relevant in married couples regarding their marital relationship, but the effects on husbands and wives differed. Husbands’ relationship satisfaction was predicted by how they perceived being supported by family. The severity of autistic behaviors predicted relationship satisfaction but only actor effect. Negative prediction of interpersonal complementarity on couple satisfaction was observed. In addition, time spent on raising children had a negative impact on the quality of the relationship. Partner effect of time spent was observed among women. Conclusion: Dyadic analysis using an actor–partner independence model confirmed perception of family support predicts relationship satisfaction among parents of children with ASD in addition to the severity of autistic behaviors and time spent caring for children.

This study aimed to reveal the critical needs of service provision for human trafficking survivors in a Midwestern state as perceived by multidisciplinary service providers. Methods: Targeting health care, social service, law enforcement, public health, and other service providers involved in anti–human trafficking service delivery, we disseminated a survey using purposive and snowball sampling. Drawing from survey responses collected in 2019 from 107 service providers working with 422 survivors of human trafficking in the previous 12 months in a Midwestern state, we examined the saliency of needs from the perspective of service providers in the health care, criminal justice, and social service sectors. Results: Respondents indicated on a Likert scale (1-5) the level of need for 37 social, health care, and legal services in their communities. The top-indicated needs statewide were mental health care, shelter/housing, peer mentorship programs, legal services, transportation, and provider training in juvenile courts, schools, law enforcement, and health care settings on human trafficking.

These effects are more pronounced for banks heavily relying on deposit funding. Evidence also reveals that more generous or credible DI design is associated with a stronger stabilization effect on bank lending during the crisis, confirmed by the difference-in-differences analysis based on expansion of DI coverage during the crisis.

We seek insights into where and when these objects formed by comparing the range of abundances observed for nine molecules and their average values across a sample of 29 comets to the predicted midplane ice abundances from models of the protosolar nebula. Our fiducial model, where ices are inherited from the interstellar medium, can account for the observed mixing ratio ranges of each molecule considered, but no single location or time reproduces the abundances of all molecules simultaneously. This suggests that each comet consists of material processed under a range of conditions. In contrast, a model where the initial composition of disk material is “reset,” wiping out any previous chemical history, cannot account for the complete range of abundances observed in comets. Using toy models that combine material processed under different thermal conditions, we find that a combination of warm (CO-poor) and cold (CO-rich) material is required to account for both the average properties of the Jupiter-family and Oort cloud comets, and the individual comets we consider. This could occur by the transport (either radial or vertical) of ice-coated dust grains in the early solar system.

Finally, we also document short sale considerations within this market sector are more informative with respect to future return predictability than similar signals observed for U.S. listed real estate firms. Specifically, increased levels of short interest outstanding, as well as elevated levels of exposure to short sale risk, both exhibit significant (negative) predictive ability over future equity returns.

And it is very challenging to restore MR data because Rician noise is signal-dependent. By exploring the nonlocal self-similarity of natural images and further using the low-rank prior of the matrices formed by nonlocal similar patches for 2D data or cubes for 3D data, we propose in this paper a new nonlocal low-rank regularization (NLRR) method including an optimization model and an efficient iterative algorithm to remove Rician noise. The proposed mathematical model consists of a data fidelity term derived from a maximum a posteriori estimation and a NLRR term using the log-det function. The resulting model in terms of approximated patch/cube matrices is non-convex and non-smooth. To solve this model, we propose an alternating reweighted minimization (ARM) algorithm using the Lipschitz-continuity of the gradient of the fidelity term and the concavity of the logarithmic function in the log-det function. The subproblems of the ARM algorithm have closed-form solutions and its limit points are first-order critical points of the problem. The ARM algorithm is further integrated with a two-stage scheme to enhance the denoising performance of the proposed NLRR method.

These community-wide genomic data will be valuable for ecology, evolution and biodiversity research. While the data revealed 27 independent origins of mangroves, the total phylogeny shows only modest increases in species number, even in coastal areas of active speciation, suggesting that mangrove extinction is common. A possible explanation for common extinction is the frequent sea-level rises and falls (SLRs and SLFs) documented in the geological record. Indeed, near-extinctions of species with extremely small population size (N) often happened during periods of rapid SLR, as revealed by the genome-wide heterozygosity of almost all mangroves. Reduction in N has possibly been further compounded by population fragmentation and the subsequent accumulation of deleterious mutations, thus pushing mangroves even closer to extinction.

Genetic analyses identified two signature amino acid residues, lysine at codon 24 (24K) with a frequency of 43.4% and arginine at codon 29 (29R) with a frequency of 34.0% in individuals with HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment. The analyses also revealed two signature residues, asparagine, 24 N (31.9%), and histidine, 29H (21.3%), in individuals without neurocognitive impairment. Both codons, 24 and 29, were associated with high entropy but only codon 29 was under positive selection. The presence of signature K24 increased by 2.08 times the risk of neurocognitive impairment, 3.15 times higher proviral load, and 69% lower absolute CD4 T-cell count compared to those without the signature.

Pregnant people seeking an abortion thus often travel to access care. Methods: We calculated state-specific abortion rate (number of abortions per thousand women ages 15 to 44) and percentage of patients leaving for abortion care using CDC 2017 Abortion Surveillance data, the Guttmacher Institute's Abortion Provider Census and Pregnancies, Births and Abortions in the United States report, and US Census data. We categorized percent leaving by abortion policy landscape using the Guttmacher Institute's classification of state abortion laws, and by facility density (number of abortion facilities per million women ages 15 to 44), calculated using Census and Guttmacher data. We ran correlational tests between each of our variables (percent leaving, facility density, and policy environment), as well as between percent leaving and facility density within policy environment. Findings: In 2017, an average of 8% of US patients left their state of residence for abortion care. Percent leaving varied widely by state: 74% left Wyoming, 57% left South Carolina, and 56% left Missouri, while 13 states had fewer than 4% of patients leaving. States with more restrictive laws averaged 12% of patients leaving, while states with middle ground or supportive laws averaged 10% and 3% leaving, respectively. Pairwise correlations between percent leaving, facility density, and policy score were all statistically significant, though correlations between percent leaving and facility density within policy environment were not. Interpretation: Many patients travel across state lines for abortion care.

Climate variability and aridity modulate the role of leaf shelters for arthropods: A global experiment,OA,-,-,-,-,Green Accepted OA,https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.16150,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85126742334,"climate change, ecosystem engineering, facilitation, insect decline, leaf shelter, microclimatic refuge, predators","Current climate change is disrupting biotic interactions and eroding biodiversity worldwide. However, species sensitive to aridity, high temperatures, and climate variability might find shelter in microclimatic refuges, such as leaf rolls built by arthropods. To explore how the importance of leaf shelters for terrestrial arthropods changes with latitude, elevation, and climate, we conducted a distributed experiment comparing arthropods in leaf rolls versus control leaves across 52 sites along an 11,790 km latitudinal gradient. We then probed the impact of short- versus long-term climatic impacts on roll use, by comparing the relative impact of conditions during the experiment versus average, baseline conditions at the site. Leaf shelters supported larger organisms and higher arthropod biomass and species diversity than non-rolled control leaves. However, the magnitude of the leaf rolls’ effect differed between long- and short-term climate conditions, metrics (species richness, biomass, and body size), and trophic groups (predators vs. herbivores). The effect of leaf rolls on predator richness was influenced only by baseline climate, increasing in magnitude in regions experiencing increased long-term aridity, regardless of latitude, elevation, and weather during the experiment. This suggests that shelter use by predators may be innate, and thus, driven by natural selection. In contrast, the effect of leaf rolls on predator biomass and predator body size decreased with increasing temperature, and increased with increasing precipitation, respectively, during the experiment. The magnitude of shelter usage by herbivores increased with the abundance of predators and decreased with increasing temperature during the experiment. Taken together, these results highlight that leaf roll use may have both proximal and ultimate causes. Projected increases in climate variability and aridity are, therefore, likely to increase the importance of biotic refugia in mitigating the effects of climate change on species persistence.",,10.1111/gcb.16150,13652486,3694,Horizon 2020 Framework Programme,PAPIIT IV200418,85126742334 (Scopus),13541013,11,3710,2022-06-01,,https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.16150,Global Change Biology,28

While previous studies have resolved relationships of lineages with fleshy fruits into subclades, relationships among capsular species remain unresolved. This lack of resolution has impeded reclassification of non-monophyletic genera, whose current taxonomy relies heavily on traits that have undergone convergent evolution. Methods: Targeted sequence capture using a probe-set recently developed for the centropogonid clade was used to obtain phylogenomic data from DNA extracted from both silica-dried and herbarium leaf tissue. These data were used to infer relationships among species using concatenated and partitioned species tree methods, and to quantify gene tree discordance. Key Results: While silica-dried leaf tissue resulted in longer assembled sequence data, the inclusion of herbarium samples improved taxonomic representation. Relationships among baccate lineages are similar to those inferred in previous studies, although they differ for lineages within and among capsular clades. We improve the phylogenetic resolution of Siphocampylus, which forms ten groups of closely related species which we informally name. Two subclades of Siphocampylus and two individual species are rogue taxa whose placement differs widely across analyses. Gene tree discordance (including cytonuclear discordance) is rampant. Conclusions: This first phylogenomic study of the centropogonid clade considerably improves our understanding of relationships in this rapid radiation. Differences across analyses and the possibility of additional lineage discoveries still hamper a solid and stable reclassification. Rapid morphological innovation corresponds with a high degree of phylogenomic complexity, including cytonuclear discordance, nuclear gene tree conflict and well-supported differences between analyses based on different nuclear loci. Together, these results point to a potential role of hemiplasy underlying repeated convergent evolution. This hallmark of rapid radiations is probably present in many other species-rich Andean plant radiations.",,10.1093/aob/mcac046,10958290,723,National Science Foundation,1523880,85143238851 (Scopus),03057364,6,736,2022-05-12,,https://doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcac046,Annals of Botany,129

Patient-report outcomes were: Perceived health status (12- item Short Form Health Survey), quality of life (Linear Analogue Scale and Satisfaction with Life Scale), sense of coher- ence-13, psychological distress (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), and illness perception (Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire). In this sample, 137 (3.5%) had HF at the time of investigation, 298 (7.5%) had a history of HF, and 3524 (89.0%) had no current or past episode of HF. Patients with current or past HF were older and had a higher prevalence of complex congenital heart disease, arrhythmias, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, other clinical comorbidities, and mood disorders than those who never had HF. Patients with HF had worse physical functioning, mental functioning, qual- ity of life, satisfaction with life, sense of coherence, depressive symptoms, and illness perception scores.

The main disagreements have been over how the phyllomes associated with the flower were arranged relative to the inflorescence axis especially during early flower initiation. Methods: Here we investigated the evolution of inflorescences in Solanaceae by analyzing inflorescence structure in the context of phylogeny using ancestral state reconstruction (ASR) to determine the evolutionary transitions between loosely arranged and tightly clustered inflorescences and between monochasial-like and dichasial-like cymes. We also reconstructed two- and three-dimensional models for 12 solanaceous species that represent both inflorescence and phylogenetic diversity in the family. Results: Our results indicate that the most recent common ancestor of Solanaceae had a loosely arranged and monochasial-like cyme, while tightly clustered inflorescences and dichasial-like cymes were derived. Compared to the known process of scorpioid cyme evolution, Solanaceae achieved their scorpioid cyme-like inflorescences through a previously undescribed way. Along the pedicel, the two flower-preceding prophylls are not in the typical transverse position of dicotyledonous plants; they frequently have axillary buds, and the main inflorescence axis continues in a sympodial fashion. As a result, the plane of symmetry of the flower is 36° from the median, and the inflorescence axis and the two flower-preceding prophylls are symmetrically located along that plane. Conclusions: A better understanding of the morphological evolution of solanaceous inflorescence structure helped clarify the floral symmetry of Solanaceae.",,10.1002/ajb2.1864,15372197,746,National Science Foundation,DEB‐1355109,85130590154 (Scopus),00029122,5,767,2022-05-01,35619567.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/ajb2.1864,American Journal of Botany,109

Acclimation of plants to non-freezing cold before exposure to freezing temperatures improves the outcome of plants, compared to plants exposed to freezing without acclimation. Arabidopsis thaliana plants were subjected to one of three treatments: (1) “control”, i.e., growth at 21◦C, (2) “non-acclimated”, i.e., 3 days at 21◦C, 2 h at −8◦C, and 24 h recovery at 21◦C, and (3) “acclimated”, i.e., 3 days at 4◦C, 2 h at −8◦C, and 24 h recovery at 21◦C. Plants were harvested at seven time points during the treatments, and lipid levels were measured by direct-infusion electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Ion leakage was measured at the same time points. To examine the function of lipid species in relation to freezing tolerance, the lipid levels in plants immediately following the freezing treatment were correlated with the outcome, i.e., ion leakage 24-h post-freezing. Based on the correlations, hypotheses about the functions of specific lipids were generated. Additionally, analysis of the lipid levels in plants with mutations in genes encoding patatin-like phospholipases, lipoxygenases, and 12-oxophytodienoic acid reductase 3 (opr3), under the same treatments as the wild-type plants, identified only the opr3-2 mutant as having major lipid compositional differences compared to wild-type plants.",385,10.3390/metabo12050385,22181989,,National Science Foundation,DBI 1726527,85129879692 (Scopus),,5,,2022-05-01,,https://doi.org/10.3390/metabo12050385,Metabolites,12

Many factors are associated with an individual’s perception of stress, including neuroticism and perceived social support. This study aimed to examine the role of neuroticism and perceived social support as mediators of fear of COVID-19 on perceived stress. Methods: Data from 3299 participants aged ≥18 years from the HOME-COVID-19 survey in 2020 were used for analysis. Measurements used included the Fear of COVID-19 and Impact on Quality of Life Scale, the Perceived Stress Scale-10, the Neuroticism inventory and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support-12.

Altered brain integrity, measured by neuropsychological (NP) performance and neuroimaging, is still prevalent among virally suppressed PWH. Age-related conditions such as cardiovascular disease may also affect brain integrity. This study investigated the effects of cardiovascular risk, VL, and HIV serostatus on cerebral blood flow (CBF), brain volumetrics, and cognitive function in PWH and persons without HIV (PWoH).Methods:Ten-year cardiovascular risk, using the Framingham Heart Study criteria, was calculated in PWH (n = 164) on cART with undetectable (≤20 copies/mL; n = 134) or detectable (>20 copies/mL; n = 30) VL and PWoH (n = 66). The effects of cardiovascular risk on brain integrity (CBF, volume, and cognition) were compared for PWH (undetectable and detectable VL) and PWoH.Results:PWH had smaller brain volumes and worse NP scores than PWoH. PWH with detectable and undetectable VL had similar brain integrity measures. Higher cardiovascular risk was associated with smaller volumes and lower CBF in multiple brain regions for PWH and PWoH. Significant interactions between HIV serostatus and cardiovascular risk on brain volumes were observed in frontal, orbitofrontal, and motor regions. Cardiovascular risk was not associated with cognition for PWH or PWoH.Conclusions:Neuroimaging, but not cognitive measures, was associated with elevated cardiovascular risk. HIV serostatus was associated with diminished brain volumes and worse cognition while CBF remained unchanged, reflecting potential protective effects of cART.

Because sexual desire partly depends on who the (imagined) sexual partner is, this study focuses on increasing sexual desire for the long-term partner specifically. Aim: This study examined 3 regulation strategies: (i) positive reappraisal of the partner, (ii) reappraisal of sexual desire decline, and (iii) sexual imagery about the partner. We tested whether these 3 strategies increased (i) sexual desire for the partner, (ii) motivated attention for the partner, as indicated by the late positive potential (LPP) amplitude, and (iii) infatuation, attachment, and relationship satisfaction. Methods: Twenty-five young adults (6 men) who were in a long-term relationship performed the regulation strategies and no regulation before passively viewing a picture of their partner. Outcomes: The LPP amplitude was measured during the partner picture. After each strategy, participants rated their sexual desire, infatuation, attachment, and relationship satisfaction. Results: Participants felt more sexual desire for and more infatuated with their partner after sexual imagery about the partner than after no regulation. Participants also felt more attached to their partner after positive reappraisal of the partner than after no regulation. There was no evidence that any of the strategies influenced relationship satisfaction or motivated attention. Clinical Implications: Sexual imagery about the partner is a simple strategy that people can use without involving the partner to increase sexual desire for (and infatuation with) their long-term partner. Strengths & Limitations: One of the strengths of the current study is the experimental manipulation of strategy use within participants, which allows for conclusions of causality. The main limitation is the small, inclusive convenience sample. This study had good power to detect medium effects but was underpowered to detect small effects. Participants were mostly young adult women in relatively short long-term relationships. Gender differences in the effectiveness of the 3 strategies were not hypothesized or tested.

Our paper is an extended version of our previously published paper in the International Conference on Computational Science 2021. Our method considers converting an image into a virtual environment, which maps to the original image and consists of HIV+ and HIV− female agents depending on the distribution of the pixels. Then, the algorithm introduces HIV+ male agents the purpose of which is to move around and infect other HIV− female agents. The movements of the HIV+ male agents are designed in a way that follows the relative coding approach, utilized in different chain coding projects. The relative coding increases the likelihood of generating consecutive codes that are encoded in a similar manner, and therefore, helps in providing better compression ratios. The algorithm tracks certain HIV+ male movements and uses them along with other pieces of information to reconstruct the original image back. As the literature shows, agent-based modeling can be advantageous over mathematical techniques and it can be effectively applied in some domains. The outcomes revealed that we could outperform standardized benchmarks used by researchers in the image processing community. Additionally, the paired samples t-tests reveal that the mean differences between our results and the ones generated by the other benchmarks (e.g. JBIG2) are statistically significant.",101613,10.1016/j.jocs.2022.101613,,,,,85125889008 (Scopus),18777503,,,2022-05-01,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jocs.2022.101613,Journal of Computational Science,61

Three strategies for implementing high-performance HSCs are also identified: facility management platform, education and training centre and innovation centre. Conclusions: HSC implementation is an holistic approach. The critical TOEI factors collectively build a foundation for centre activities.

TF-CBT role-play assessments were conducted with a sample of 43 therapists as part of a larger training study. The TF-CBT role-play assessments were independently coded for TF-CBT adherence and skill by a certified TF-CBT trainer and three clinical psychology doctoral students. Findings indicated good interrater reliability for the individual items (ICC: M =.71, SD =.15). Regarding utility, 67.19% (n = 43/64) of contacted therapists completed the role-play assessment, which took an average of 30 min (M = 31.42, SD = 5.65) to complete and 60 min (M = 62.84, SD = 11.31) to code. Therapists with a master’s degree were more likely to complete the role-play assessment than those with other degrees but no other differences in demographic variables, practice characteristics, or TF-CBT knowledge or training were found between participants and nonparticipants. Role-play assessments may offer an alternative to observational coding for assessing therapist adherence and skill, particularly in contexts where session recordings are not feasible.",,10.1007/s10488-021-01169-9,15733289,374,Missouri Foundation for Health,,85115230776 (Scopus),0894587X,3,384,2022-05-01,34546482.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10488-021-01169-9,Administration and Policy in Mental Health and Mental Health Services Research,49

Setting: The BAT-L is the first validated instrument to diagnose traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) throughout the life span for post-9/11 veterans. The BAT-L/IPV was adapted to target diagnostic issues belonging exclusively to IPV while maintaining its life span approach. Participants: Community-dwelling convenience sample of 51 female survivors of IPV with subthreshold (n = 10) or full diagnostic criteria (n = 41) of posttraumatic stress disorder. Design: Standard TBI criteria were evaluated using a semistructured clinical interview. Main Measures: The BAT-L/IPV is compared with the Ohio State University TBI Identification Method (OSU-TBI-ID) scoring approach as the criterion standard. Results: Correspondence between the BAT-L/IPV and the OSU-TBI-ID score was excellent (Cohen κ = 0.86; Kendall τ-b = 0.89).

Several studies have detected the presence of leptospiral antibodies in captive Neotropical primates, suggesting that they are asymptomatic carriers. However, the presence of antibodies in free-ranging primates and their potential role as reservoirs for this pathogen is not known. In this study, we used the Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT) to screen two species of free-ranging tamarins for the presence of Leptospira antibodies using a panel of 21 serogroups. A total of 56 primates (26 Leontocebus weddelli and 30 Saguinus imperator) were screened at the Estación Biológica Río Los Amigos in Madre de Dios, Peru.

Discussions of the “crime decline” focus specifically on civilian crime, positioning civilians as the sole danger to the health, wealth, and safety of individuals. Violence committed by the state—from police homicide to deaths in custody to in-prison sexual assault—is not found in the traditionally reported crime rate. These absences belie real dangers posed to individuals which are historical and contemporary, nonnegligible, and possibly rising.

An active lifestyle is linked to improved cognition among PLWH, yet the neural substrates remain unclear. Diffusion tensor imaging and diffusion basis spectrum imaging measure HIV-related changes in brain white matter integrity. We used these measures of structural brain integrity to assess white matter changes, physical fitness, and cognition in a cross-sectional study of PLWH.Methods:Forty-four virologically well-controlled PLWH were recruited (average age of 56 years, a median recent CD4+count of 682 cells/mm3). Diffusion tensor imaging -derived fractional anisotropy (FA) and diffusion basis spectrum imaging-derived axonal density were calculated. Cardiorespiratory fitness [maximal volume of oxygen consumption (VO2max)] was measured by performing indirect calorimetry during exercise to volitional exhaustion. Cardiovascular risk was assessed by the Framingham risk score. Neuropsychological performance (NP) testing evaluated learning, memory, psychomotor/processing speed, and executive function. Partial correlations assessed the relationships among cardiorespiratory fitness, neuroimaging, NP, and HIV clinical metrics (CD4+count and time since diagnosis).Results:Higher VO2max was associated with higher FA and higher axonal density in multiple white matter tracts, including the corticospinal tract and superior longitudinal fasciculus. Better NP in the motor/psychomotor domain was positively associated with FA and axonal density in diverse tracts including those associated with motor and visuospatial processing. However, higher VO2max was not associated with NP or HIV clinical metrics.Conclusions:An active lifestyle promoting cardiorespiratory fitness may lead to better white matter integrity and decreased susceptibility to cognitive decline in virologically well-controlled PLWH.",,10.1097/QAI.0000000000002907,10779450,558,National Institute of Mental Health,R01MH118031,85130551805 (Scopus),15254135,5,565,2022-04-15,34966145.0,https://doi.org/10.1097/QAI.0000000000002907,Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes,89

Situated approaches are often pitched as alternatives to computational and representational approaches, according to which cognition is computation over representations. I argue that, far from being opposites, situatedness and neural representation are more deeply intertwined than anyone suspected. To show this, I introduce a neurocomputational account of cognition that relies on neural representations. I argue not only that this account is compatible with (non-question-begging) situated approaches, but also that it requires embodiment, embeddedness, enaction, and affect at its very core. That is, constructing neural representations and their semantic content, and learning computational processes appropriate for their content, requires a tight dynamic interaction between nervous system, body, and environment. Most importantly, I argue that situatedness is needed to give a satisfactory account of neural representation: neurocognitive systems that are embodied, embedded, affective, dynamically interact with their environment, and use feedback from their interaction to shape their own representations and computations (1) can construct neural representations with original semantic content, (2) their neural vehicles and the way they are processed are automatically coordinated with their content, (3) such content is causally efficacious, (4) is determinate enough for the system's purposes, (5) represents the distal stimulus, and (6) can misrepresent.

Design/methodology/approach: Based on the dynamic capabilities theory and the relational view, this paper examines how TKIC, a special case of dynamic capability, influences business performance. The research context is the Brazilian automobile industry, in which firms are currently experimenting with modular production and increasing their interactions with suppliers. Using a sample of automobile suppliers, this investigates how relational resources, such as the buyer’s trust in its suppliers and the level of supplier involvement, affect the level of TKIC, which, in turn, is hypothesized to affect business performance. In addition, this paper examines the moderating effect of various communication media on the TKIC-business performance relationship. The findings confirm the importance of relational resources and TKIC on business performance. Finally, this paper explores various theoretical and managerial implications to encourage future research. Findings: The results suggested that the two relational resources (supplier involvement and buyer’s trust) are important drivers of TKICs and that the level of supplier involvement in the production process mediates the relationship between buyer’s trust and TKIC. Moreover, this study found that TKIC leads to superior firm performance, but the degree of media naturalness does not seem to facilitate knowledge transfer. The results confirm that supplier involvement is a pivotal process in that the buying firm’s internal resources and the major suppliers’ resources and capabilities are combined to achieve a competitive advantage – TKIC. Research limitations/implications: This study is subject to the typical limitations inherent in cross-sectional research designs using subjective measures. That said, this still has some important implications indicating that relational resources, such as buyer’s trust and supplier involvement, are critical in developing TKIC that “seize” opportunities from interfirm relationships and integrate knowledge across and within firm boundaries. Moreover, while knowledge management tools can resemble face-to-face interactions to the largest extent, the research suggested that it cannot substitute face-to-face communications in transferring tacit knowledge. Practical implications: Managers deal with complex interactions and linkages due to tacit knowledge from components, systems and modules, which are critical in developing organizational capabilities. Relational resources are important strategic assets facilitating resource combination and coordination. Managers must coordinate among multiple sources of learning and partner with their suppliers at an earlier stage to develop the relational capabilities and efficiently steer the process of boundary redefinition. Finally, managers must have the ability to manage tacit knowledge within the interface with suppliers using organizational mechanisms (i.e. TKIC) to help them absorb external knowledge from their supplier network and integrate it with specific internal competences. Social implications: Recent disruptive technological developments pressure organizations to become more flexible by requiring firms to adapt quickly to constantly changing markets and to have the ability to apply different resources and capabilities to specific unique situations. All this with a huge impact on the firm’s employees and society in general. Thus, interfirm relationships and the role of knowledge integration is especially crucial, given the current industry trend in favor of experimenting with innovative production methods (e.g. flexible manufacturing and modular production) that can help managers to rethink work conditions in a more meaningful and flexible for society. Originality/value: While prior research treats integrative capability mainly as a mechanism that explains superior firms’ performance in an interfirm relationship, few research efforts have explicated what shapes TKICs. By examining the relationship between relational resources, TKIC and performance, this study fills this research gap and develops and tests a theoretical framework.",,10.1108/JKM-07-2020-0501,17587484,805,,,85097596526 (Scopus),13673270,4,823,2022-04-08,,https://doi.org/10.1108/JKM-07-2020-0501,Journal of Knowledge Management,26

This cycle of association has prompted a recommendation for psychological treatment of chronic pain to target mechanisms for emotion regulation. The current trial addressed this need by investigating a new internet-delivered treatment incorporating emotional skills training from dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT). Using a single-case experimental design that is suited to heterogeneous populations and can demonstrate efficacy with a small sample, three participants with chronic pain were recruited. Participants received four weeks of online DBT skills training (iDBT-Pain intervention) which incorporated one-on-one sessions over Zoom and a web app. Results revealed compelling evidence for the intervention on the primary outcome of emotion dysregulation and were promising for the secondary outcome of pain intensity. Improvement was also identified on pre-and post-measures of depression, coping behaviors, sleep problems, wellbeing, and harm avoidance, indicating that the intervention may positively influence other factors related to chronic pain. Overall, the trial provides preliminary efficacy for the intervention to improve chronic pain. However, we recommend further investigation of the iDBT-Pain intervention, either in single case trials, which when conducted with scientific rigor may be aggregated to derive nomothetic conclusions, or in a group-comparison trial to compare with usual modes of treatment. Perspective: This trial advances understanding of emotion-focused treatment for chronic pain and provides evidence for a viable new technological treatment.

An academic-community partnership redesigned its community-based screening program to ensure access to services for African American men, incorporating a session with a trained clinical educator in community settings, designed to increase knowledge and promote informed decision-making regarding PSA testing. This study evaluated effects of the intervention on decision-making outcomes. Methods: To evaluate program efficacy, 88 men completed pre- and post-test surveys assessing outcomes of interest. Results: Participants’ knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, anxiety levels, and self-efficacy all improved from pre- to post-test at a statistically significant level. Most notably participants’ awareness that PCa is often not life-threatening, and watchful waiting is a reasonable treatment option increased after the encounter. More than half of the study sample felt they had received enough knowledge to make an informed decision about whether the PSA test was right for them.

Characteristics of the child, caregiver, and family have been investigated in relation to caregiver's help seeking behavior for children's psychological difficulties; yet, these associations have been inconsistent, and are very understudied among younger maltreated children. Other aspects of the child's environment, such as father involvement, negative life events, and neighborhood risk and satisfaction have not been examined. It is also uncertain how cumulative maltreatment and the specific forms of maltreatment - sexual, physical, and emotional abuse, neglect, and domestic violence, are associated with mental health consultation. Objective: The aim of the current study was to utilize an ecological model that included child, caregiver, family, neighborhood, and maltreatment factors to better understand caregiver's help seeking behavior. Participants/setting/method: The study relied upon 448 six-year-old maltreated children (47.5% male; 48.7% Black) from the Longitudinal Studies in Child Abuse and Neglect (LONGSCAN) study. Results: Several factors, including child's gender and externalizing symptoms, and caregiver educational attainment and depression and were associated with mental health consultation. Cumulative maltreatment, however, was unrelated. When the specific forms of maltreatment were included, none of the individual maltreatment types were tied to help seeking behavior.

Our results highlighted that Dipetalonema species are divided in two well-supported clades, one containing D. yatesi and D. caudispina, and the second containing D. robini, D. gracile, and D. graciliformis. Due to sequence ambiguities from GenBank entries, relationships among isolates of D. gracile and D. graciliformis cannot be fully resolved, which requires further investigation.

From the Power and Control Wheel, the most frequent types of abuse were using privilege, physical abuse, economic abuse, isolation, and sexual abuse. Case typologies included: those with elements of sex trafficking, specifically forced commercial sex by an IP or family member; those with elements of labor trafficking such as domestic servitude (with or without childcare provision abuse), exploitation in a family business by an IP or family member, or work environments by family and non-family; those with elements of sex and labor trafficking included servile partnerships and forced marriage.

In particular, SST performs very well in estimating instantaneous frequencies (IFs) and separating the components of non-stationary multicomponent signals with slowly changing frequencies. However its performance is not desirable for signals having fast-changing frequencies. Two approaches have been proposed for this issue. One is to use the 2nd-order or high-order SST, and the other is to apply the instantaneous frequency-embedded SST (IFE-SST). For the SST or high order SST approach, one single phase transformation is applied to estimate the IFs of all components of a signal, which may yield not very accurate results in IF estimation and component recovery. IFE-SST uses an estimation of the IF of a targeted component to produce accurate IF estimation. The phase transformation of IFE-SST is associated with the targeted component. Hence the IFE-SST has certain advantages over SST in IF estimation and signal separation. In this article, we provide theoretical study on the instantaneous frequency-embedded short-time Fourier transform (IFE-STFT) and the associated SST, called IFE-FSST.

In this study, we evaluated (1) the recovery pattern of dead wood volumes across a chronosequence of secondary tropical forests that used to be former coffee plantations, and (2) the efficiency of two common restoration strategies to recover dead wood volumes similar to those found in old-growth forests, all in a tropical premontane landscape in southern Costa Rica. Restoration strategies consisted of plantations and natural regeneration. Plantations consist of plots where two endemic (Terminalia amazonia and Vochysia guatemalensis) and two naturalized (Inga edulis and Ertyhrina poeppegiana) species were planted in rows. Natural regeneration consists of plots where no trees were planted, but where agriculture or cattle are excluded though fencing and vegetation is allowed to regenerate naturally. We hypothesized that (1) dead wood volumes increase with forest age following a logistic shape, and that (2) restoration plantations recover dead wood volumes more quickly compared to naturally regenerated forests. We measured dead wood volumes in a total of 35 forest fragments that were former coffee plantations or are currently old-growth forests and 10 restoration plots containing either natural regeneration or restoration plantations that were former fallow or pasture using strip transects. Dead wood volumes significantly increased with forest age following a logistic shape, starting with very low values in early ages (3–5 years), increasing rapidly (6–50 years), and ending with high and relatively stable values after 50 years of age. In addition, plantations (16 to 17 years old) recovered 41% of dead wood volumes found in old-growth forests > 100 years old, whereas naturally regenerated forests of the same age only recovered 1.7% of dead wood volumes found in old-growth forests.

Operating from the assumption that isochronous snare drum hits in rock are heard as a backbeat, placing those snare drum hits on beats other than 2 and 4 creates a particular kind of metrical dissonance, which I refer to as a backbeat switch. I examine two ways in which a backbeat switch occurs, the quick flip and the polymetric pogo. A quick flip usually occurs at a phrase break, where the drummer apparently (but intentionally) “drops a beat” and then resumes the backbeat pattern, thus shifting it “to the left.” A polymetric pogo involves a situation where the backbeat-insistent drummer is pitted against the rest of the band playing in an odd-cardinality meter, resulting in snare hits that bounce back and forth between even-numbered beats and odd-numbered beats every other measure. Short examples by The Cars, Paul Weller, Steve Vai, and Sting are used to demonstrate the article’s fundamental concepts, and longer examples by Tesla, Jerry Goldsmith, and Extreme place these concepts into larger contexts.",2,10.30535/MTO.28.1.2,10673040,,,,85135975768 (Scopus),,1,,2022-03-01,,https://doi.org/10.30535/MTO.28.1.2,Music Theory Online,28

Methods such as logistic regression or the naïve Bayes algorithm produce a score related to the likelihood that a record belongs to a particular class. A cutoff threshold is then defined to delineate the prediction of one class over another. This paper derives analytic results for the selection of an optimal cutoff threshold for a classification algorithm that is used to inform a two-action decision in the cases of risk aversion and risk neutrality. The results provide insight to how the optimal cutoff thresholds relate to the associated costs and the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm for both the risk neutral and risk averse decision makers. The optimal risk averse threshold is not reliably above or below the optimal risk neutral threshold, but the relation depends on the parameters of a particular application. The results further show the risk averse optimal threshold is insensitive to the size of the data set or the magnitude of the costs, but instead is sensitive to the proportion of positive records in the data and the ratio of costs. Numeric examples and sensitivity analysis derive further insight. Results show the percent value gap from a misspecified risk attitude increases as the specificity of the classification algorithm decreases.",,10.1287/deca.2021.0438,15458504,63,,,85134701970 (Scopus),15458490,1,78,2022-03-01,,https://doi.org/10.1287/deca.2021.0438,Decision Analysis,19

However, limited evidence exists on MAT's differential effect on treatment completion across age groups. This study aims to ascertain the role of MAT and age in treatment completion among veterans seeking treatment in non-Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare facilities for opioid use disorder. Methods: We used the Treatment Episode Data Set - Discharges (TEDS-D; 2006-2017) to examine trends in treatment and MAT usage over time and TEDS-2017 to determine the role of age and MAT in treatment completion. We examined a subset of those who self-identified as veterans and who sought treatment for an opioid use disorder. Results: Veterans presented in treatment more often as heroin users than prescription opioid users, and older veterans were more likely to get MAT than younger veterans. We found that before propensity score matching, MAT initially appeared to be associated with a lower likelihood of treatment completion in inpatient ($\beta $ = -1.47, 95% CI -1.56 to -1.39) and outpatient ($\beta $ = -1.40, 95% CI -2.21 to -0.58) settings, and age (50+ years) appeared to mediate the effect of MAT on treatment completion ($\beta $ = -0.54, 95% CI -0.87 to -0.21). After matching, older veterans were more likely to complete substance use disorder treatment ($\beta $ = 0.21, 95% CI 0.01-0.42), while age no longer mediated the effect of MAT, and MAT had a significant positive impact on treatment completion in detox settings ($\beta $ = 1.36, 95% CI 1.15-1.50) and inpatient settings ($\beta $ = 1.54, 95% CI 1.37 -1.71).

This article presents a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based deep learning application for precisely regaining high-resolution (HR) CXR images from low-resolution (LR) CXR correspondents for COVID-19 identification. Respectively, using the building blocks of GAN, we introduce a modified enhanced super-resolution generative adversarial network plus (MESRGAN+) to implement a connected nonlinear mapping collected from noise-contaminated low-resolution input images to produce deblurred and denoised HR images. As opposed to the latest trends of network complexity and computational costs, we incorporate an enhanced VGG19 fine-tuned twin network with the wavelet pooling strategy in order to extract distinct features for COVID-19 identification. We demonstrate our proposed model on a publicly available dataset of 11,920 samples of chest X-ray images, with 2980 cases of COVID-19 CXR, healthy, viral and bacterial cases.

There is no doubt that low resolution, noise and irrelevant annotations in chest X-ray images are a major constraint to the performance of AI-based COVID-19 diagnosis. While a few studies have made huge progress, they underestimate these bottlenecks. In this study, we propose a super-resolution-based Siamese wavelet multi-resolution convolutional neural network called COVID-SRWCNN for COVID-19 classification using chest X-ray images.

In this context, our main hypothesis was that, along the altitudinal gradient, we would find different plant communities that would be driven by different environmental variables (climatic, edaphic, and physiographic). Therefore, to assess the vegetation structure of the pure Deodar forests of the unexplored Manoor Valley (Northwestern Himalaya), Pakistan, frequent field visits were carried out during different seasons of 2015–2018. Ecological methods: Line transects sampling (23 stands) and phytosociological attributes were evaluated in relation to geographical and environmental variables. Various statistical software applications (i.e., PCORD, RStudio 4.0, and R 3.6.1) were used to examine all of the gathered data of plant species and environmental variables. A total of three different plant communities (Cedrus–Isodon–Cynodon, Cedrus–Cynodon–Dryopteris, and Sambucus–Cedrus–Desmodium) were identified by grouping 162 species and 23 stands in pure Deodar forests under the influence of geographic, slope, edaphic, and climatic variables, ranging from 1580.8 to 2373.8 m. The altitude (1936–2373 m), slope angle (25–85◦), sandy (29–48%) and loamy soil texture, wind speed (1.45 ms−1), and temperature (25.8◦C) all had a strong influence on the Sambucus–Cedrus–Desmodium community. In contrast with this, the Cedrus–Cynodon–Dryopteris community showed a positively significant relationship with the northeastern slope, silty (32–58%) and sandy (15.8–55%) loamy soil texture, and barometric pressure (814.3 pa). Nonetheless, the Cedrus–Isodon–Cynodon community revealed a significant positive association with the northeastern to southwestern slope, pH (6.3), wet bulb (19.7), and dew point (17.7). We found significant differences (p < 0.001) among the three communities found in the pure Deodar forests in the four diversity indexes. The Sambucus–Cedrus–Desmodium community has the maximum number of plants (129 species), Shannon’s diversity (H’ = 3.7), and Simpson’s dominance (0.98) values among the recorded communities. The Pielou’s evenness index value was led by the Cedrus–Isodon–Cynodon community (0.97). Beta diversity showed a dissimilarity lower than 50% among the three communities.

COVID-19 must be diagnosed as soon as possible in order to control the disease and provide proper care to patients. The chest X-ray (CXR) has been identified as a useful diagnostic tool, but the disease outbreak has put a lot of pressure on radiologists to read the scans, which could give rise to fatigue-related misdiagnosis. Automatic classification algorithms that are reliable can be extremely beneficial; however, they typically depend upon a large amount of COVID-19 data for training, which are troublesome to obtain in the nick of time. Therefore, we propose a novel method for the classification of COVID-19. Concretely, a novel neurowavelet capsule network is proposed for COVID-19 classification. To be more precise, first, we introduce a multi-resolution analysis of a discrete wavelet transform to filter noisy and inconsistent information from the CXR data in order to improve the feature extraction robustness of the network. Secondly, the discrete wavelet transform of the multi-resolution analysis also performs a sub-sampling operation in order to minimize the loss of spatial details, thereby enhancing the overall classification performance.

Malicious agents threaten patients’ health and life by stealing or altering data as it flows among the multiple domains of healthcare networks. The problem is likely to exacerbate with the increasing use of IoT devices, edge, and core clouds in the next generation healthcare networks. Presented in this paper is MUSE, a system of deep hierarchical stacked neural networks for timely and accurate detection of malicious activity that leads to alteration of meta-information or payload of the dataflow between the IoT gateway, edge and core clouds. Smaller models at the edge clouds take substantially less time to train as compared to the large models in the core cloud. To improve the speed of training and accuracy of detection of large core cloud models, the MUSE system uses a novel method of merging and aggregating layers of trained edge cloud models to construct a partly pre-trained core cloud model. As a result, the model in the core cloud takes substantially smaller number of epochs (6 to 8) and, consequently, less time, compared to those in the edge clouds, training of which take 35 to 40 epochs to converge. With the help of extensive evaluations, it is shown that with the MUSE system, large, merged models can be trained in significantly less time than the unmerged models that are created independently in the core cloud. Through several runs it is seen that the merged models give on an average 26.2% reduction in training times. From the experimental evaluation we demonstrate that along with fast training speeds the merged MUSE model gives high training and test accuracies, ranging from 95% to 100%, in detection of unknown attacks on dataflows. The merged model thus generalizes very well on the test data.

This paper presents the development of the models used to create GEDI's footprint-level (~25 m) AGBD (GEDI04_A) product, including a description of the datasets used and the procedure for final model selection. The data used to fit our models are from a compilation of globally distributed spatially and temporally coincident field and airborne lidar datasets, whereby we simulated GEDI-like waveforms from airborne lidar to build a calibration database. We used this database to expand the geographic extent of past waveform lidar studies, and divided the globe into four broad strata by Plant Functional Type (PFT) and six geographic regions. GEDI's waveform-to-biomass models take the form of parametric Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) models with simulated Relative Height (RH) metrics as predictor variables. From an exhaustive set of candidate models, we selected the best input predictor variables, and data transformations for each geographic stratum in the GEDI domain to produce a set of comprehensive predictive footprint-level models. We found that model selection frequently favored combinations of RH metrics at the 98th, 90th, 50th, and 10th height above ground-level percentiles (RH98, RH90, RH50, and RH10, respectively), but that inclusion of lower RH metrics (e.g. RH10) did not markedly improve model performance. Second, forced inclusion of RH98 in all models was important and did not degrade model performance, and the best performing models were parsimonious, typically having only 1-3 predictors. Third, stratification by geographic domain (PFT, geographic region) improved model performance in comparison to global models without stratification. Fourth, for the vast majority of strata, the best performing models were fit using square root transformation of field AGBD and/or height metrics. There was considerable variability in model performance across geographic strata, and areas with sparse training data and/or high AGBD values had the poorest performance. These models are used to produce global predictions of AGBD, but will be improved in the future as more and better training data become available.",112845,10.1016/j.rse.2021.112845,,,National Science Foundation,NE/P004806/1,85123289336 (Scopus),00344257,,,2022-03-01,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2021.112845,Remote Sensing of Environment,270

Evolutionary assembly of the Arctic flora,-,-,-,-,-,-,https://doi.org/10.1111/geb.13434,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85120647487,,"Aim: The Arctic is the coldest inhabited region on Earth, and it supports few terrestrial species. The tropical-climate origin of many angiosperm clades, along with strong phylogenetic niche conservatism, likely constrained colonization of cold environments for many plants. However, invasion of the Arctic by many lineages might also have opened up a new adaptive landscape that facilitated subsequent diversification. We might, therefore, expect species in this biome to be descendants of a few cold-tolerant lineages. Here, we explore the assembly of the Arctic flora using data on the relationships and distributions of > 80,000 species. Location: The Northern Hemisphere. Time period: Current. Taxon: Flowering plants. Methods: The Arctic was divided into five bioclimate subzones. We assembled a species pool for flowering plants in the Northern Hemisphere, and determined which species of the species pool are distributed in the Arctic and each of its subzones. We used two metrics (the standardized effect sizes of mean pairwise distance and Faith’s phylogenetic diversity; MPDses and PDses, respectively) to quantify phylogenetic dispersion of flowering plant assemblages. Results: When the Arctic species were compared to all the species in the Northern Hemisphere, MPDses and PDses were −12.85 and −27.17, respectively, indicating that the Arctic flora is a phylogenetically clustered subset of the Northern Hemisphere species pool. In general, MPDses and PDses decreased from the south to the north within the Arctic, indicating that some lineages are further filtered stepwise into more northerly Arctic subzones. Main conclusions: The species of the Arctic flora comprise a phylogenetically clustered subset of the broader Northern Hemisphere flora. The more negative value for PDses compared to MPDses indicates that clustering is stronger towards the tips of the phylogenetic tree. We suggest that the majority of Arctic species are nested within clades having attributes that enabled adaptation to cold climates.",,10.1111/geb.13434,14668238,396,Chinese Academy of Sciences,XDA20050203,85120647487 (Scopus),1466822X,3,404,2022-03-01,,https://doi.org/10.1111/geb.13434,Global Ecology and Biogeography,31

Further, our inquiry discloses a pattern of error in identifying “victims” and “offenders” in the data, and finds that investigating agencies are often incorrectly listed as the responsible agency, which seriously jeopardizes police department-level analyses. Finally, there is evidence of sample bias such that the SHR data system is not representative of all police departments, nor is it representative of large police departments.

A review of the literature suggests that gentrification in older industrial cities will look different in systematic ways from gentrification in global, magnet cities that most research has focused on. The literature also suggests that the political and institutional differences in cities located in different national contexts can shape gentrification processes. Our research shows that Dortmund and St. Louis are both undergoing deep processes of economic restructuring with new knowledge workers moving in to neighborhoods adjacent to expanding tech clusters. The speed and magnitude of gentrification, however, is significantly less than reported in strong market cities. Unlike in hot market, global cities, many areas within Dortmund and St. Louis are experiencing little or no gentrification, and the neighborhoods that are experiencing gentrification-like processes vary significantly along important dimensions. Despite important differences in political institutions, the basic pattern of gentrification in St. Louis and Dortmund is similar.

The results indicated that Cd stress did not decrease the concentrations of monogalactosyldiacyglycerol (MGDG), phosphatidylcholine (PC), lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and phosphatidic acid at 6 h, but decreased digalactosyldoacylglycerol (DGDG), MGDG, PC, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylserine (PS) and LPC concentrations in wheat root at 24 h. Although the concentrations of highly abundant glycerolipids PC and PE were decreased, the ratios of PC/PE increased thus contributing to wheat adaptation to Cd stress. Cd did not reduce the extent of total lipid unsaturation due to the unchanged concentrations of high abundance species of C36:4, C34:2, C34:3 and C36:6 at 6 h, indicative of their roles in resisting Cd stress.

Here we carry out hitherto the comprehensive density functional investigation into the material properties of Mn2RuGa, and introduce two concepts - the spin anchor site and the optical active site - as two pillars for AOS in ferrimagnets. In Mn2RuGa, Mn(4a) serves as the spin anchor site, whose band is below the Fermi level and has a strong spin moment, while Mn(4c) is the optical active site whose band crosses the Fermi level. Our magneto-optical Kerr spectrum and band structure calculation jointly reveal that the delicate competition between the Ru-4d and Ga-4p states is responsible for the creation of these two sites. These two sites found here not only present a unified picture for both Mn2RuGa and GdFeCo, but also open the door for future applications.

Diabetes is caused by persistently high blood glucose levels, which leads to blood vessel aggravations and vision loss. Early diagnosis can minimise the risk of proliferated diabetic retinopathy, which is the advanced level of this disease, and having higher risk of severe impairment. Therefore, it becomes important to classify DR stages. To this effect, this paper presents a weighted fusion deep learning network (WFDLN) to automatically extract features and classify DR stages from fundus scans. The proposed framework aims to treat the issue of low quality and identify retinopathy symptoms in fundus images. Two channels of fundus images, namely, the contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) fundus images and the contrast-enhanced canny edge detection (CECED) fundus images are processed by WFDLN. Fundus-related features of CLAHE images are extracted by fine-tuned Inception V3, whereas the features of CECED fundus images are extracted using fine-tuned VGG16. Both channels’ outputs are merged in a weighted approach, and softmax classification is used to determine the final recognition result. Experimental results show that the proposed network can identify the DR stages with high accuracy.

To this effect, we have taken into consideration improving the performance of COVID-19 identification by tackling the issue of low quality and resolution of computed tomography images by introducing our method. We have reported about a technique named the modified enhanced super resolution generative adversarial network for a better high resolution of computed tomography images. Furthermore, in contrast to the fashion of increasing network depth and complexity to beef up imaging performance, we incorporated a Siamese capsule network that extracts distinct features for COVID-19 identifica-tion.The qualitative and quantitative results establish that the proposed model is effective, accurate, and robust for COVID-19 screening. We demonstrate the proposed model for COVID-19 identification on a publicly available dataset COVID-CT, which contains 349 COVID-19 and 463 non-COVID-19 computed tomography images. The proposed method achieves an accuracy of 97.92%, sensitivity of 98.85%, specificity of 97.21%, AUC of 98.03%, precision of 98.44%, and F1 score of 97.52%. Our approach obtained state-of-the-art performance, according to experimental results, which is helpful for COVID-19 screening.

Outcomes and adherence to oral antibiotics for PWID with patient-directed discharge (PDD) remain understudied. Methods: We conducted a prospective multicenter bundled quality improvement project of PWID with SIRI at 3 hospitals in Missouri. All PWID with SIRI were offered multidisciplinary care while inpatient, including the option of addiction medicine consultation and medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). All patients were offered oral antibiotics in the event of a PDD either at discharge or immediately after discharge through an infectious diseases telemedicine clinic. Additional support services included health coaches, a therapist, a case manager, free clinic follow-up, and medications in an outpatient bridge program. Patient demographics, comorbidities, 90-day readmissions, and substance use disorder clinic follow-up were compared between PWID with PDD on oral antibiotics and those who completed intravenous (IV) antibiotics using an as-treated approach. Results: Of 166 PWID with SIRI, 61 completed IV antibiotics inpatient (37%), while 105 had a PDD on oral antibiotics (63%). There was no significant difference in 90-day readmission rates between groups (P = .819). For PWID with a PDD on oral antibiotics, 7.6% had documented nonadherence to antibiotics, 67% had documented adherence, and 23% were lost to follow-up. Factors protective against readmission included antibiotic and MOUD adherence, engagement with support team, and clinic follow-up. Conclusions: PWID with SIRI who experience a PDD should be provided with oral antibiotics.

The literature review reveals common themes in writing on the history of development—neocolonialism, knowledge production, and statecraft—but also shows that scholars have given too much power to development paradigms and policies. While the scholarship has demonstrated the rhetorical significance of development and the importance of developmentalist states, historians have paid less attention to institutional cleavages, material outcomes, and the complexity of development intervention on the ground. New work draws on oral histories to center local communities, while also examining national and transnational actors and contexts. Examining how development was executed on the ground, and how local communities experienced and reconfigured development, has the potential to help scholars completely rethink these histories. Recent scholarship demonstrates the long-term continuities of development; the disjunctures between economic theory and development practice; the particular forms of power and modalities of governance that have emerged in different settings; and the social, political, and material implications for local communities targeted by the international development apparatus.",e12712,10.1111/hic3.12712,14780542,,,,85123936202 (Scopus),,2,,2022-02-01,,https://doi.org/10.1111/hic3.12712,History Compass,20

Caregiver-child symptom discrepancies are common in this population and have been related to treatment outcome. However, research has not examined whether caregiver–child symptom concordance is associated with attrition. The aim of the study was to determine whether pretreatment caregiver–child symptom agreement predicted premature termination from trauma-focused treatment. Two hundred and sixty-nine treatment-seeking children ages 8 to 12 (M = 9.97, SD = 1.49; 64.7% female, 51.3% Black) and their non-offending caregivers were included in the study. Two operational definitions of attrition are as follows: (a) clinician-rated dropout, and (b) whether the child received an adequate dose of treatment (i.e., 12 or more sessions), which were used to more thoroughly examine premature termination. Rates of attrition were high (68.1% clinician-rated premature termination, 37.4% received inadequate dose). Levels of symptom concordance between caregivers and children were low across symptom difficulties (intraclass correlations =.003–.16). Lower levels of discordance for posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) were associated with an increased likelihood of receiving an adequate dose of treatment (odds ratio [OR] = 1.03). Nonetheless, unexpectedly, higher levels of caregiver–child discordance for anxiety symptoms at pretreatment predicted both clinician-rated treatment completion and adequate dose (ORs =.97,.96, respectively). However, caregiver’s and children’s perceptions of children’s trauma-related difficulties may not converge, and thus, both reports are important to assess.

However, few studies have tested which of the two climate variables is the primary determinant. In this study, we assess whether winter coldness or temperature seasonality is more strongly associated with the northern latitudinal limits of tree species and with tree species richness in North America. Tree species were recorded in each of 1198 quadrats of 110 km × 110 km in North America. We used correlation and regression analyses to assess the relationship of the latitude of the northern boundary of each species, and of species richness per quadrat, with winter coldness and temperature seasonality. Species richness was analyzed within 38 longitudinal, i.e., north-south, bands (each being >1100 km long and 110 km wide). The latitudes of the northern range limits of tree species were three times better correlated with minimum temperatures at those latitudes than with temperature seasonality. On average, minimum temperature and temperature seasonality together explained 81.5% of the variation in the northern range limits of the tree species examined, and minimum temperature uniquely explained six-fold (33.7% versus 5.8%) more of this variation than did temperature seasonality. Correlations of tree species richness with minimum temperatures were stronger than correlations with temperature seasonality for most of the longitudinal bands analyzed.

Methods: HIV-infected MSM and transgender women (average age: 27 years and education: 13 years) enrolled within 100 days from the estimated date of detectable infection (EDDI). A cognitive performance (NP) protocol was administered at enrollment (before ART initiation) and every 24 weeks until week 192. An overall index of cognitive performance (NPZ) was created using local normative data. Blood (n = 87) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; n = 29) biomarkers of inflammation and neuronal injury were examined before ART initiation. Regression analyses assessed relationships between time since EDDI, pre-ART biomarkers, and NPZ. Results: Adjusting for multiple comparisons, shorter time since EDDI was associated with higher pre-ART VL and multiple biomarkers in plasma and CSF. NPZ scores were within the normative range at baseline (NPZ = 0.52) and at each follow-up visit, with a modest increase through week 192. Plasma or CSF biomarkers were not correlated with NP scores at baseline or after ART.

However, past studies have been limited by effort-intensive, time-consuming, and error-prone processes involved in collecting, organizing, and standardizing drinking topography data. Recent technologies allowing integrated data collection and greater environmental control, such as virtual reality (VR), could resolve these problems. Methods: In this pilot project, we assessed alcohol consumption topography of participants in a VR drinking environment with a programmable virtual confederate (i.e., bar goer) during two testing sessions. In one, the confederate drank quickly (30–60 s sip interval). In the other, the confederate drank slowly (60–120 s sip interval). Participants’ hands and beverage were represented in VR. Between sips, beverages were placed on a Bluetooth-enabled scale, allowing real-time updates of drink weight. Participant experience was assessed after each testing visit. Multilevel modeling was used to characterize the effect of confederation condition on sip interval and sip volume. Descriptive analyses were used for participant experience data. Results: Results showed significant, moderate-to-strong between-visit correlations for topographic measures (r = 0.50 to r = 0.84) and indicate participants found the experience to be comfortable and acceptable. Multilevel models indicated participants had greater sip volumes and lower sip intervals when the confederate drank quickly.

As an opioid receptor antagonist, naltrexone blocks activation of the endogenous opioid system, which is involved in the affectively reinforcing properties of substance use. Few studies, however, have examined the moderating effect of naltrexone on the association between affect and alcohol use. Additionally, most existing research on naltrexone has been with adults in the human laboratory. Method: We conducted a secondary analysis of ecological momentary assessment data from a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled cross-over study that compared naltrexone (50 mg/daily) and placebo in 26 adolescents (15 to 19 years old) who exhibited problematic drinking patterns. Multilevel models tested whether naltrexone moderated associations of alcohol use with both positive and negative affect (PA, NA). Results: Results indicated that, during naltrexone treatment, greater estimated blood alcohol concentration (eBAC) levels were associated with greater NA further into drinking episodes. In turn, greater NA after the first drink of an episode was associated with reduced subsequent eBAC values during naltrexone treatment. Low PA was also associated with lower subsequent eBAC levels in the naltrexone condition after the first drink. Conclusions: These findings support the idea that naltrexone can disrupt the association between affect and alcohol use, effects that emerge later in drinking episodes. Greater attention to the effects of naltrexone on affect and reinforcement may help to tailor psychotherapy to maximize the benefits of naltrexone. However, in the present study, as most drink reports were in the first 2 h of the drinking episode and participants reported affect only at the first three end-drink reports of a drinking episode (limiting the number of drinks reported), we had reduced power to detect effects in the continuation phase. Thus, replication of the findings is needed using a design that assesses the impact of naltrexone across the entire episode.",,10.1111/acer.14768,15300277,326,National Institutes of Health,AA017273,85122899389 (Scopus),01456008,2,337,2022-02-01,34959253.0,https://doi.org/10.1111/acer.14768,Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research,46

Such differences may be vulnerability factors or simply correlates of APNS-related symptoms. Longitudinal studies that measure neurocognitive functioning at the time of trauma are needed to determine whether such differences precede the development of APNS. Methods: Here, we present findings from a subsample of 666 ambulatory patients from the AURORA (Advancing Understanding of RecOvery afteR trumA) study.

We examined associations of neurocognitive test performance shortly after MVC with peritraumatic symptoms in the ED and APNS (depression, post-traumatic stress, post-concussive symptoms, and pain) 2 weeks and 8 weeks later. Neurocognitive tests assessed processing speed, attention, verbal reasoning, memory, and social perception. Results: Distress in the ED was associated with poorer processing speed and short-term memory. Poorer short-term memory was also associated with depression at 2 weeks post-MVC, even after controlling for peritraumatic distress. Finally, higher vocabulary scores were associated with pain 2 weeks post-MVC. Limitations: Self-selection biases among those who present to the ED and enroll in the study limit generalizability. Also, it is not clear whether observed neurocognitive differences predate MVC exposure or arise in the immediate aftermath of MVC exposure.

Here, we conduct the first phylogenomic study of Anoura by analyzing 2039 genome-wide ultraconserved elements (UCEs) sequenced for 42 individuals from 8 Anoura species/lineages plus two outgroups. Overall, our results based on UCEs resolved relationships in the genus and supported (1) the monophyly of small-bodied Anoura species (previously genus Lonchoglossa); (2) monotypic status of A. caudifer; and (3) nested positions of “A. carishina”, A. caudifer aequatoris, and A. geoffroyi peruana specimens within A. latidens, A. caudifer and A. geoffroyi, respectively (suggesting that these taxa are not distinct species). Additionally, (4) phylogenetic networks allowing reticulate edges did not explain gene tree discordance better than the species tree (without introgression), indicating that a coalescent model accounting for discordance solely through incomplete lineage sorting fit our data well. Sensitivity analyses indicated that our species tree results were not adversely affected by varying taxon sampling across loci.

We further consider a subsample of participants convicted of sexual offenses to illustrate the unique way that monetary sanctions are levied on groups of people who are considered more morally culpable and worthy of carceral control. We find that monetary sanctions are regularly assessed and challenging for most participants. The stigma of a sexual offense conviction and economic precarity, particularly among Black members of the sample, further the costs of punishment. We contend that costs associated with a sexual offense are unique because they can continue in perpetuity, govern normative behavior, and are centered on an assumption of continued guilt.

Height recovery from the 1997–1998 strong El Niño disturbance took approximately 15 yr. Frequency of canopy gaps varied an order of magnitude among years and 96% disappeared in ≤2 yr. High-canopy coverage and gap frequency varied substantially across the local gradients of soil nutrients and topography, and plot-level conditions and trends frequently differed from the landscape-level patterns.

Because PTSS include negative alterations in cognitions, trauma-exposed parents may have skewed perceptions of themselves as parents. However, no studies have examined whether there is an indirect effect of PTSS on parenting through parents’ self-perceptions. Path analysis was used to determine (a) whether DSM-5 posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom clusters are related to parenting indices (i.e., support, satisfaction, involvement) and self-perceptions, (b) if parental self-perceptions are tied to aspects of parenting, and (c) if there is an indirect effect of PTSS on parenting through parental self-perceptions. Participants were 223 trauma-exposed parents (Mage= 36.92 years, SD = 7.9, 63.7% female) recruited from a midwestern U.S. university or via Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Negative alterations in cognitions and mood were inversely related to parental support, B = −0.41, p =.008, and alterations in arousal and reactivity were inversely associated with parental self-perceptions, B = −1.26, p =.001. Parental self-perceptions were positively related to all parenting indices, Bs = 0.27–0.44.

This study uses a quasi-experimental design to evaluate the long-term effect of arrest in young adulthood on health behaviors in midlife for African Americans. We use propensity score matching methods and gender-specific multivariate regression analyses to equate those who did and did not incur an arrest in young adulthood from a subsample (n = 683) of the Woodlawn cohort, an African American community cohort followed from childhood into midlife. The results suggest that, for men, having been arrested in young adulthood has a direct effect on smoking, daily drinking, and risky sexual behaviors into midlife while young adult arrest does not seem to impact midlife health risk behaviors for women.

Yet, as few studies have examined these links in a multivariate manner, it is unclear which symptoms are most strongly related to SBPs and ISBPs. Research regarding children’s reports of their difficulties and SBPs and ISBPs is also very limited. The current study investigated the relations between both caregiver- and child-reported trauma-related symptoms and SBPs and ISBPs among 248 treatment-seeking sexually abused children (ages 6–12; M = 8.06, SD = 2.52; 64.5% female; 55.6% white). Children’s caregiver-reported trauma-related sexual concerns and anger were associated with SBPs. For ISBPs, only caregiver-reported sexual concerns were related to ISBPs. Surprisingly, none of the child-reported symptoms were associated with either SBPs or ISBPs. Trauma-related sexual concerns and anger may be tied to SBPs, whereas other clinical difficulties may be less strongly implicated.

Individuals with low alcohol sensitivity, a known risk factor for alcohol use disorder (AUD), exhibit stronger cueelicited craving than their higher-sensitivity (HS) peers in both laboratory and real-world contexts. Here, underage drinkers (N = 155) completed a 21-day ecological momentary assessment (EMA) protocol in which they recorded exposure to alcohol cues and levels of craving during both nondrinking and postdrinking moments. Multilevel modeling detected a significant interaction of cue exposure and postdrinking status on craving. Cue-induced craving was increased in postdrinking moments compared to nondrinking moments. Contrary to prediction, cue-elicited increase in craving during nondrinking moments was stronger in participants reporting higher sensitivity to alcohol. In the presence of cues, lower sensitivity was robustly related to craving intensity in the postdrinking state but unrelated to craving during nondrinking moments. Craving during drinking episodes in the natural environment is magnified by the presence of alcohol cues, potentially contributing to the maintenance or acceleration of drinking episodes.

Yet, it is not clear how maltreatment may impact indices of fertility and the specific forms of maltreatment may exhibit distinct associations with aspects of fertility. Because posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) have corresponded with a longer length to conception, it is prudent to account for current level of trauma symptoms. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the five types of maltreatment and PTSS were positively related to infertility, including length of time to conception, number of live births and miscarriages, and use of infertility treatments. Method: Two hundred seventy-five trauma-exposed females (Mage = 38.82, SD = 12.73) who had been, or had tried to become, pregnant participated in the study. Results: Despite expectations, none of the maltreatment types, nor PTSS, was related to longer length to conception. Minorities reported longer length of time to conceive.

There are two distinguishing features of mortgage default analysis. First, predictor variables are often only recorded at origination. However, many important variables such as credit scores vary over time. Second, there are omitted variables (such as borrower’s income and job security). If omitted variables are correlated with included regressors or if only origination values are used in a dynamic model, then biases may be present in econometric models for default risk. Our focus is to develop a ridge regression model to impute the dynamics of time-varying predictors and to capture unobserved borrower heterogeneity. The model is evaluated using cross-validation, and the relevant parameters are tuned to maximize out-of-sample predictive performance. After allowing for imputed dynamics and borrower heterogeneity, we find that the loan-to-value ratio becomes a larger signal of default risk and that credit scores as well as full documentation become smaller signals of default risk. These changes primarily are driven by imputing static variables, rather than dynamics, and may pertain to either omitted liquidity factors or strategic factors.",,10.1007/s11146-022-09934-9,1573045X,,,,85144580879 (Scopus),08955638,,,2022-01-01,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11146-022-09934-9,Journal of Real Estate Finance and Economics,

Two hierarchical linear regression models examined associations between individual (i.e., emotion dysregulation, anger severity), relational (i.e., family support, friend support), and contextual (i.e., community cohesion, community disorder) factors, and PTSS and resilience. At the individual level, higher emotion dysregulation was associated with higher PTSS and lower resilience; anger severity was not related to either outcome. At the relational level, more friend support was negatively associated with PTSS. Friend and family support were positively related to resilience. At the contextual level, community cohesion was positively associated with resilience, but not PTSS, and community disorder was unrelated to both outcomes. Findings demonstrate unique factors across the social ecology that differentially relate to PTSS and resilience.

Indeed, infertility engenders feelings of shame and social isolation. However, infertility sufferers do not experience infertility as a one-time traumatic event; rather, implications exist for family members of those who are directly experiencing infertility, especially parents of adult children. Thus, infertility affects family social support for this critical population through disenfranchised grief. Clinically, we have found that family therapy remains a powerful experience for both individuals who are experiencing infertility, as well as their family circles. Indeed, infertility engenders egregious stress on families, not just individuals and couples. To our knowledge, no family therapy interventions have addressed this area of family stress within the academic literature. We propose that Emotionally Focused Family Therapy (EFFT) is an excellent theoretical fit for treating families experiencing infertility. Within this article, we will outline a review of how infertility not only impacts individuals and couples, but also families, and how family therapy provides a salient form of healing for all involved. We will also address how specific EFFT interventions may be applied to treating families navigating infertility through our three-stage family therapy process.

Data were reported according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) checklist. Results: In 128 nurses, 19.35% of nurses had probable PTSD. Network analysis showed strong significant correlations between life satisfaction and perceived stress (negative), between perceived stress and PTSD symptomatology (positive), and between attitude toward life and compassion satisfaction (positive). Conclusion: Low life satisfaction, high perceived stress, and low attitude toward life are key inflection points that signal the need for psychological intervention in the US nursing workforce during the continued pandemic. Based on 2021 Tri-Council of Nursing COVID-19 Report and the 2022 International Council of Nurses guideline, healthcare should implement scalable, system-level interventions to reduce psychological burden during the pandemic. The current study suggests targets for such intervention, which may promote a healthier, more effective US nursing workforce.",,10.1177/23779608221140719,23779608,,University of Missouri-St. Louis,,85143680145 (Scopus),,,,2022-01-01,,https://doi.org/10.1177/23779608221140719,SAGE Open Nursing,8

The analysis included an examination of arrest trends before and after the passing of state legislation in 2011 to include trafficking in persons in the Ohio Revised Code. The addition of this law aimed to identify victims, provide necessary services, and coordinate investigation. The results revealed that human trafficking arrests increased slightly over the 10-year period. Prostitution related arrests varied over the same period but did illustrate a general downward trend relative to human trafficking arrests. Anti-trafficking legislative changes are intended to influence patterns of both human trafficking arrests and prostitution-related arrests.

In all these social media postings related to the pandemic, specific attention has been focused on healthcare professionals, specifically nurses. Objective: This study aimed to explore how the keyword ‘nurse’ is located in COVID-19 pandemic-related tweets during a selected period of the pandemic in order to assess public perception. Methods: Tweets related to COVID-19 were downloaded from Twitter for the period January 1st, 2020, to November 11th, 2021. Sentiment analysis was used to identify opinions, emotions, and approaches expressed in tweet which included ‘nurse’, ‘COVID-19’, and ‘pandemic’ as either keyword or hashtags. Results: A total of 2,440,696 most used unique words in the downloaded 582,399 tweets were included and the sentiment analysis indicated that 24.4% (n = 595,530) of the tweets demonstrated positive sentiment while 14.1% (n = 343,433) of the tweets demonstrated negative sentiment during COVID-19. Within these results, 17% (n = 416,366) of the tweets included positive basic emotion words of trust and 4.9% (n = 120,654) of joy.

This article presents the initial development and validation of a caregiver-report instrument, the Preschooler Stressor-related Thoughts and Worries (PSTW) scale, developed during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, caregivers from two countries reported on their child’s cognitions at baseline (T0) and three months later (T1; age 3–5 years; Australia: N = 559; United States: N = 346). Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted with the Australian sample at T0 and confirmed with the U.S. sample at T0. Exploratory factor analysis suggested a one-factor model including 10 items. Results of the confirmatory factor analysis failed to clearly support this structure (comparative fit index =.91, root mean square error of approximation =.11). Construct validity was supported by positive associations between PSTW scores and emotional and behavioral problems.

The existing literature squarely places remote working as an antecedent to employee perceptions of Organizational Justice throughout many industries. The same literature presents work from home in a positive frame of reference in a pre-pandemic world. However, in the Covid-19 environment, many perceptions have changed regarding employment. Likely overall perceptions regarding work from home have also shifted because more people engage in the activity. We argue that perceptions of work from home through the frame of reference found in the literature of Organizational Justice have shifted to be more negative. To study this phenomenon, we gathered social media data in comments from a work discussion forum on the Reddit website. We coded the data with an a priori codeset and assigned dummy variables for analysis. The dataset was analyzed via a five-way Factorial ANOVA examining the influences of the four independent variables of Organizational Justice (Distributive, Procedural, Interpersonal, and Informational Justice) and the temporal occurrence of Covid-19 on the sentimental polarity of comments surrounding the topic of work from home. Our findings indicated that Informational Justice significantly contributes to more negative sentiment regarding work-from-home. Additionally, when Distributive, Interpersonal, and Informational Justice and Distributive and Informational Justice interact, sentimental polarity grows more negative for work from home.

Method: Twenty-eight migrants were enrolled in a multiarm double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) that included three groups: (a) traumafocused EW, (b) neutral EW, and (c) control. Participants completed self-report measures at pretreatment, immediately after the intervention, and at 1 month follow-up.

Results: Trauma-focused EW was related to an immediate improvement in phobic anxiety and positive total symptoms and improvement in somatization, global severity index, and hope for the future at follow-up. Trauma symptoms and alexithymia did not show significant effects. Factorial regressions showed that the interaction group per time per hope for the future was a significant predictor on the phobic anxiety.

However, incoming workers required higher wages to match market demands. Owing to the existence of pay secrecy policies having the potential of making existing workers feel ostracized because elements of seniority, loyalty, and distrust of their employers, a cycle of cynicism and deeper senses of ostracism likely are occurring.

The result is an increasingly competitive field of social service provision in which organizations must differentiate themselves in the struggle over funding, contracts, symbolic authority, and potential clients. We explore this struggle by examining the distinct roads to reentry constructed at four PVS organizations in Ontario, Canada. Our analysis initiates a dialogue between individual narratives and organizational discourses, contending that the road to reentry is coauthored among organizations and criminalized individuals—albeit on unequal terms. Our findings reveal that there are significant pressures for criminalized individuals to perform narrative labor to align themselves with organizational understandings of reentry. Such pressures include: the denial of services or social assistance payments, threats of being returned to prison for “inadequate” participation in rehabilitation, and risks of not being considered for coveted “professional ex” positions at PVS organizations. In light of these empirical findings, we also offer a conceptual reflection on the challenges criminalized individuals likely face accessing services from multiple organizations with differing roads to reentry, suggesting that navigating these diverse roads not only requires narrative labor, but also narrative dexterity.",,10.1177/14624745221128102,17413095,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,,85139504657 (Scopus),14624745,,,2022-01-01,,https://doi.org/10.1177/14624745221128102,Punishment and Society,

Emotionally responsive parenting could protect against the negative effects of chaos for children. However, both the perception of chaos and impact of parenting behaviors on children's behavior may vary with race, ethnicity, crowding in the home, and other contextual factors. Method: This study examined relations among chaos, observed emotional responsivity, and toddler's subsequent behavior problems among EHS Family and Child Experiences Study participants. Results: Chaos was associated with more behavior problems, and three-way interaction findings indicated significant group differences by race and ethnicity in the relation between chaos and parenting on behavior problems. Behavior problems were also higher in lower socioeconomic contexts, and with child exposure to violence.

We predict and find that the association between tax avoidance and the likelihood of a tax-related restatement is nonlinear. Specifically, both relatively high levels and relatively low levels of tax avoidance compared to peer firms increase the likelihood of incurring a tax-related restatement. We consider whether the increased likelihood for high avoiders is attributable to obfuscation necessary to escape detection of tax avoidance or weak corporate governance. For high avoiders, we find evidence that both obfuscation and weak corporate governance may contribute to the likelihood of a tax-related restatement. As low avoiders should not need to obfuscate, we focus on corporate governance and find an increased likelihood when governance is weak. In response to a tax-related restatement announcement, we document a decline in tax avoidance for firms that have relatively high tax avoidance prior to the restatement announcement. We attribute this to the increased level of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) monitoring and strengthening of corporate governance that we observe post-restatement announcement.

Rejection sensitivity, a disposition that one tends to anxiously expect, readily perceive, and intensely react to social rejection, has been associated with reactive aggression. Considering that the mechanism underlying this link remains unclear, this study explores the mediating role of loneliness and maladaptive coping. Participants included 1104 early adults between the ages of 17–23 (Mage = 20.35, SD = 1.11, 33.6% men) in China who completed the Chinese version of the Tendency to Expect Rejection Scale, Loneliness Scale, Ways of Coping Questionnaire, and Reactive-Active Aggression Questionnaire. The serial mediation model revealed that loneliness and maladaptive coping independently mediated the association of rejection sensitivity with reactive aggression. More importantly, the chain mediating effect of “loneliness-maladaptive coping” also accounted for this link.

This study examines three major issues on the ballot as factors that predicted Gambians’ voting decisions, which are economic conditions, human rights abuses, and support for candidates based on ethnicity. While the findings suggest some evidence of ethnic voting among some ethnic groups, a major factor that influenced the choices of most Gambians was human rights abuses by Jammeh’s regime.

We believe this theory provides a suitable framework in which to ground questions of professional ethics for nonprofit fundraising professionals. The adoption of Ethics of Care as a normative ethical theory for fundraising will allow applied ethical questions in the field to be explored in a way that more fully addresses all parties involved in fundraising and affected by its outcomes.

In this paper we build stochastic models for analyzing Jaya and semi-steady-state Jaya algorithms. For these algorithms, the computational cost depends on how, at each iteration, the new individual fares against the existing individual. Costs must be incurred for any replacement of individuals and the subsequent update of the population-worst individual's (and/or the population-best individual's) index. We use the following two quantities as the main metrics for analysis: the expected number of updates in a generation of the worst individual's index, and the corresponding expectation for updating the best individual's index. Clearly, the higher these expectations, the costlier the algorithm. The analysis shows that for semi-steady-state Jaya (a) the maximum expected number of worst-index updates per generation is 1.7 regardless of the population size; (b) regardless of the population size, the expectation of the number of best-index updates per generation decreases monotonically with generations; (c) upper bounds as well as asymptotics of the expected best-update counts can be obtained for specific distributions; the upper bound is 0.5 for normal and logistic distributions, 2 for the uniform distribution, and e-γ in 2 for the exponential distribution, where γ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant; the asymptotic is e-γ in 2 for logistic and exponential distributions and in 2 for the uniform distribution (the asymptotic cannot be obtained analytically for the normal distribution).

Objectives: This manuscript describes the rationale, methods, and initial results supporting the implementation of Missouri’s recent stimulant-focused efforts–including previously-prohibited activities such as Contingency Management and fentanyl test strip distribution. Methods: Missouri’s State Opioid Response team facilitated the design and implementation of Contingency Management pilot programming abiding by federal spending limits of no more than $75 of incentives per client, mass distribution of fentanyl test strips, and publicly accessible harm reduction trainings and materials specific to stimulant use. Data sources used for initial evaluations included state-level treatment claims, fentanyl test strip distribution counts by type and region of organizations receiving them, and qualitative feedback from stakeholders. Results: Six substance use treatment agencies developed Contingency Management programs, serving 29 individuals in the first nine months.

Yet the human rights impact of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic seems to have varied widely, both across rights and across countries. How have human rights practices been affected by the pandemic so far? Which human rights were most negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic? Which states were most likely to experience these negative effects, and which states avoided a reduction in the enjoyment of human rights due to the pandemic? To provide some early answers to these questions, the Human Rights Measurement Initiative (HRMI) added questions to its annual practitioner survey that aimed at determining how a subset of civil, political, economic, and social rights was affected by COVID-19 in 2020 in 39 countries around the world. Using both quantitative and qualitative data from this survey, in combination with other indicators, this article provides a description of COVID-19’s human rights impact as seen by practitioners on the front lines around the world, as well as insight into the larger question of which factors enabled states to maintain a high level of enjoyment of human rights just when those rights were needed the most.",,10.1080/14754835.2022.2082244,14754843,317,,,85134231007 (Scopus),14754835,3,333,2022-01-01,,https://doi.org/10.1080/14754835.2022.2082244,Journal of Human Rights,21

Methods: Longitudinal student surveys and corresponding school-level data come from 21 middle and high schools in 6 districts in St. Louis County, Missouri. Multilevel multinomial logistic regression was used to assess factors related to a three-category dependent variable, distinguishing youth with: (1) no police contact, (2) in-school contact, and (3) out-of-school contact. Independent variables capture student-level demographics, behavior, experiences, and perceptions and school-level characteristics and practices. Results: Factors associated with in-school contact include substance use, peer associations, prior contact, and prior school sanctions. Odds of school-based contact also increase when youth are less aware of school rules and perceive greater disorder. Among school-level characteristics, only officers responding to school problems is significantly associated with in-school contact. Conclusions: There is some consistency in individual-level factors associated with police contact across locations, particularly related to prior sanctions, but findings highlight potential mechanisms that vary across contexts.

The present study examined whether complex trauma and the characteristics of complex trauma (i.e., chronic/multiple, interpersonal, early age) were related to caregiver- and youth-reported suicidality among 267 treatment-seeking youth aged 6–18 (M = 11.04, SD = 3.35; 65.2% female; 64% Black). We also investigated whether complex trauma would remain associated with suicidality after accounting for youth’s posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). Youth’s age was related to caregiver-reported suicidality, whereas gender was linked to youth-reported suicidality. Despite expectations, complex trauma was unrelated to caregiver- and youth-reported suicidality, regardless of PTSS, and none of the characteristics of complex trauma were tied to reports of suicidality. Youth-reported PTSS was related to caregiver- and youth-reported suicidality. These findings do not indicate that complex trauma is specifically associated with suicidality among treatment-seeking children, although replication is needed.

To understand and process such phenomena, 'divide-and-conquer' is probably the most common strategy to address the problem. In other words, the captured signal is decomposed into signal components for each individual component to be processed. Unfortunately, for signals that are superimposition of non-stationary amplitude-frequency modulated (AM-FM) components, the 'divide-and-conquer' strategy is bound to fail, since there is no way to be sure that the decomposed components take on the AM-FM formulations which are necessary for the extraction of their instantaneous frequencies (IFs) and amplitudes (IAs). In this paper, we propose an adaptive signal separation operation (ASSO) for effective and accurate separation of a single-channel blind-source multi-component signal, via introducing a time-varying parameter that adapts locally to IFs and using linear chirp (linear frequency modulation) signals to approximate components at each time instant. We derive more accurate component recovery formulae based on the linear chirp signal local approximation. In addition, a recovery scheme, together with a ridge detection method, is also proposed to extract the signal components one by one, and the time-varying parameter is updated for each component. The proposed method is suitable for engineering implementation, being capable of separating complicated signals into their components or sub-signals and reconstructing the signal trend directly.

From a critical cosmopolitan lens, language and literacy educators guide students to develop a cosmopolitan worldview; dismantle hierarchies through reading, writing, and thinking; and take action for justice worldwide. The purpose of this article is to converge cosmopolitanism, critical pedagogy, and teacher perceptions to construct a framework for teaching critical cosmopolitan literacies. The findings suggest five dimensions of critical cosmopolitan literacies: proximal stance, reflexive stance, reciprocal stance, responsive stance, and praxis.

The significant challenges faced by IPV survivors needing treatment may be ameliorated by condensing effective treatments for PTSD, such as cognitive processing therapy (CPT), in an accelerated delivery timeline. Method: Using a multiple subject, single case design of six matched pairs of 12 female IPV survivors, we preliminarily tested the relative effectiveness of individual massed CPT delivered over 5 days (mCPT) as compared with standard CPT (sCPT) delivery in women IPV survivors. Assessments included full psychiatric diagnostic interviews, clinical interviews assessing trauma history and head injury prior to treatment, symptom monitoring during treatment, and full repeat assessments at 1 month and 3 months following treatment. Results: No treatment group effect was found for PTSD severity between mCPT and sCPT among intention-to-treat, F(1, 10) =.01, p =.93. Both mCPT and sCPT were associated with significant improvement in PTSD, F(2, 20) = 45.05, p <.001, ds = 1.32–2.38). Conclusion: Overall, findings indicate mCPT appears effective in reducing psychological symptoms for women IPV survivors and suggest that condensed treatment is both palatable and feasible.

Participant adherence was good (82%) even without in-person contact. Alcohol use patterns conformed to theoretical expectations: Participants were more likely to drink on Fridays and Saturdays than other days, men drank more than women, and higher Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT; Saunders et al., 1993) scores were associated with an increased likelihood of use and more overall drinking on a given day. Second, we present data from 429 Prolific participants screened for a history of mental health issues who completed assessments 2 weeks apart with strong retention (N = 377; 88%).

Despite the prevalence of TBI among IPV survivors, research is sparse in comparison with parallel populations (eg, military, accidents, sports). This pilot study aimed to provide a preliminary investigation of the effect of TBI on brain morphometry and resting-state functional connectivity in women who experience IPV. Participants: A total of 45 community-dwelling women survivors of IPV who screened positive for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Design: Participants completed comprehensive assessments of trauma exposure, PTSD, TBI history, and brain neurological health. Twenty-three participants (51.1%) met diagnostic criteria for lifetime TBI. Of these, 15 participants experienced 1 or more TBIs resulting from IPV. The remaining participants experienced TBI from non-IPV exposures (eg, sports/motor vehicle accident).

The aim of the current statewide study is threefold: to examine the provider-reported 1) demographic characteristics of identified survivors (i.e., race/ethnicity, gender identity, social class, sexuality, region of origin, and age), 2) forms of sex trafficking experienced (i.e., survival sex, intimate partner, familial, manager-facilitated), and 3) relationship between demographic characteristics and the different forms of sex trafficking experienced. Drawing from a larger study examining survey responses of 107 social, healthcare, and legal service providers, respondents reported working with 422 survivors of human trafficking accessing services in a Midwestern state in the previous 12 months, including survivors of sex trafficking (n = 349, 82.7%), sex/labor trafficking combined (n = 53, 12.6%), and labor trafficking (n = 20, 4.7%). The current study focuses on provider-reported data specifically related to sex trafficking and sex/labor trafficking combined.

Lucas, Jr.’s monetary economies are based on his methodology of using a single general equilibrium dynamic optimization model with microeconomic foundations that can be tested with econometric methods. It shows how, since his 1972 neutrality paper, Phillips curves continue to be a foundation for policy prescription contrary to Lucas’s 1972 results. In support of Lucas’s hypothesis, historical Phillips curves are shown to be idiosyncratic rather than a basis for policy. Using Lucas’s alternative microfounded approaches to money, growth, and asset pricing, the paper then presents Lucas-type extensions for money and growth using a microfounded bank production of exchange credit as an alternative to money, as suggested by Lucas.

Despite occasional waves of conservative-hardliner resistance, all three women have helped to modernise the German gender regime while opening new doors for future women leaders across the party spectrum. Having exited the political stage after the 2021 elections, the Chancellor played a significant role in advancing the political fortunes of German women, beginning with von der Leyen, who now enjoys supranational prominence as EU Commission President, and Kramp-Karrenbauer, ostensibly descending the national power ladder despite her earlier successes. These diverging trajectories raise new questions as to the conditions under which we might expect women to prove ‘effective’ leaders. This article explores biographical parallels, stylistic differences, and the changing political landscape that may have facilitated or impeded each woman’s ability to transfer the leadership skills she acquired at one level to the mastering of challenges at another.

Methods: Data come from 1306 patients presenting to 29 U.S. emergency departments (EDs) after a motor vehicle collision (MVC) in the advancing understanding of recovery after trauma study. Patients completed self-reports in the ED and 2-weeks, 8-weeks, and 3-months post-MVC. Associations of pre-MVC probable PTSD and probable MDE histories with subsequent 3-months post-MVC probable PTSD and probable MDE were examined along with mediation through intervening peritraumatic, 2-, and 8-week disorders. Results: 27.6% of patients had 3-month post-MVC probable PTSD and/or MDE. Pre-MVC lifetime histories of these disorders were not only significant (relative risk = 2.6–7.4) but were dominant (63.1% population attributable risk proportion [PARP]) predictors of this 3-month outcome, with 46.6% prevalence of the outcome among patients with pre-MVC disorder histories versus 9.9% among those without such histories. The associations of pre-MVC lifetime disorders with the 3-month outcome were mediated largely by 2- and 8-week probable PTSD and MDE (PARP decreasing to 22.8% with controls for these intervening disorders).

Incompletely understood is how brain structure can serve to differentiate cognitive impairment (CI) in the HIV-positive (i.e., HAND) from the HIV-negative cohort (i.e., MCI and AD). To that end, we designed a multi-label classifier that labels the structural magnetic resonance images (MRI) of individuals by their HIV and CI status via two binary variables. Proper training of such an approach traditionally requires well-curated datasets containing large number of samples for each of the corresponding four cohorts (healthy controls, CI HIV-negative adults a.k.a. CI-only, HIV-positive patients without CI a.k.a. HIV-only, and HAND). Because of the rarity of such datasets, we proposed to improve training of the multi-label classifier via a multi-domain learning scheme that also incorporates domain-specific classifiers on auxiliary single-label datasets specific to either binary label. Specifically, we complement the training dataset of MRIs of the four cohorts (Control: 156, CI-only: 335, HIV-only: 37, HAND: 145) acquired by the Memory and Aging Center at the University of California - San Francisco with a CI-specific dataset only containing MRIs of HIV-negative subjects (Controls: 229, CI-only: 397) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and an HIV-specific dataset (Controls: 75, HIV-only: 75) provided by SRI International. Based on cross-validation on the UCSF dataset, the multi-domain and multi-label learning strategy leads to superior classification accuracy compared with one-domain or multi-class learning approaches, specifically for the undersampled HIV-only cohort. The ‘prediction logits’ of CI computed by the multi-label formulation also successfully stratify motor performance among the HIV-positive subjects (including HAND). Finally, brain patterns driving the subject-level predictions across all four cohorts characterize the independent and compounding effects of HIV and CI in the HAND cohort.",102246,10.1016/j.media.2021.102246,13618423,,National Institutes of Health,AA010723,85117726056 (Scopus),13618415,,,2022-01-01,34706304.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2021.102246,Medical Image Analysis,75

In such and many other situations, it is necessary to separate these signals into a finite number of monocomponents to represent the intrinsic modes and underlying dynamics implicated in the source signals. In this paper, we consider the mode retrieval of a multicomponent signal which has crossing instantaneous frequencies (IFs), meaning that some of the components of the signal overlap in the time-frequency domain. We use the chirplet transform (CT) to represent a multicomponent signal in the three-dimensional space of time, frequency and chirp rate and introduce a CT-based signal separation scheme (CT3S) to retrieve modes. In addition, we analyze the error bounds for IF estimation and component recovery with this scheme. We also propose a matched-filter along certain specific time-frequency lines with respect to the chirp rate to make nonstationary signals be further separated and more concentrated in the three-dimensional space of CT. Furthermore, based on the approximation of source signals with linear chirps at any local time, we propose an innovative signal reconstruction algorithm, called the group filter-matched CT3S (GFCT3S), which also takes a group of components into consideration simultaneously. GFCT3S is suitable for signals with crossing IFs. It also decreases component recovery errors when the IFs curves of different components are not crossover, but fast-varying and close to each other. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real signals show our method is more accurate and consistent in signal separation than the empirical mode decomposition, synchrosqueezing transform, and other approaches.",103262,10.1016/j.dsp.2021.103262,,,Army Research Office,W911NF2110218,85117119695 (Scopus),10512004,,,2022-01-01,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsp.2021.103262,Digital Signal Processing: A Review Journal,120

Yet the ways in which the experience of independent living is understood and advanced locally warrants more focused attention. This article describes a collaboration among a regional Center for Independent Living (CIL) and university researchers focused on developing more informed programs and supports to promote independent living for persons with disabilities in their service area. Method: A total of 75 adults with disabilities attended four “community conversations” during which they provided diverse definitions of independent living and shared a wide range of supports they needed and currently accessed to meet their independent living goals. Results: Attendee conversations generated 14 unique dimensions of independent living and 11 categories of independent living supports. Findings align with existing research asserting independent living as a multifaceted construct and extend the literature to include perspectives across a wider range of disability categories. Conclusion: This study suggests that collaborations among Centers for Independent Living and researchers can be a fruitful context for conducting “needs assessments” and soliciting the perspectives of individuals with disabilities on (a) how they conceptualize independent living and (b) the local services and supports they need to attain their independent living goals.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION Community conversations are an efficient and engaging way of soliciting the perspectives of community members with a variety of disabilities. Establishing a planning team fluent in universal design, accessibility options, and local needs is critical to implementing effective community conversations. For Centers for Independent Living (CILs), community conversations offer a valuable approach for obtaining substantive stakeholder input to inform strategic planning.

Seemingly unrelated bivariate probit regression was used to determine whether OTP access mediates the relationship between age and treatment completion. We used propensity score matching to simulate the effects of a randomized control trial and to attenuate the likelihood of a Type 1 error. Results: Older adults have a higher likelihood than their younger counterparts of completing treatment regardless of OTP status in inpatient and outpatient settings. Those who received OTP in inpatient treatment had a 45% increased probability of completing treatment in detox settings and a 41% increased probability of completing treatment in inpatient settings. Older adults (age 50+) were more likely to receive OTP than their younger counterparts. There is a small but significant indirect effect of age on treatment completion in inpatient settings.

We find that objects associated with achievements are perceived to be more suitable as heirlooms than those associated with enjoyment, even when controlling for the overall positivity of the association. Process evidence suggests this happens because heirloom creators (i.e., givers) have a primary motive to inspire their offspring to strive for accomplishments in their own right. In this regard, such heirlooms appear to be less about creators ensuring their personal achievement legacies are never forgotten, but more about creators leveraging their achievements to motivate the creation of larger, collective legacies by their families by those in following generations.

We contribute to knowledge by examining whether there have been important shifts in the spatial clustering of poverty in America between 1980 and 2010, and if so, whether those shifts were related to changes in homicide during the period. The descriptive results of our study reveal that there were notable changes in population exposure to both high- poverty and high-low poverty spatial clusters between 1980 and 2010. Fixed-effects negative binomial regression models yield limited support for the idea that changes in spatial inequality, as measured by the clustering of high- and low-poverty neighborhoods, are associated with changes in homicide rates. In contrast, the results indicate a significant positive association between changes in exposure to very high-poverty spatial clusters and homicide trends.

Sleep concerns have been associated with PTSS and somatic symptoms. Previous research suggests that sleep affects multiple domains of functioning including comorbid psychological and physical health concerns. The current study examines whether perceived sleep quality or sleep efficiency/ duration may be mediating the relationship between PTSS and somatic symptoms in a trauma-exposed sample. Method: The sample consisted of 864 students, recruited from a large Midwestern university and compensated with research participation credit.

Using both real and fictitious brands across a variety of choice contexts, seven experiments demonstrate that consumers find preferential decision-making easier when it occurs in the presence (vs. absence) of brands. Consistent with the details of our framework, this effect: (i) is explained by the activation of decision readiness, (ii) leads to outcomes such as increased outcome satisfaction and decreased decision delegation, and (iii) is attenuated when exposure is to only one brand.

Understanding disease progression over the life span is vital for the care of people living with HIV (PLWH).Setting:Virologically suppressed PLWH (n = 297) on combination antiretroviral therapy and 1509 HIV-uninfected healthy controls were evaluated. PLWH were further classified as cognitively normal (CN) or cognitively impaired (CI) based on neuropsychological testing.Methods:Feature selection identified resting-state networks (RSNs) that predicted HIV status and cognitive status within specific age bins (younger than 35 years, 35-55 years, and older than 55 years). Deep learning models generated voxelwise maps of RSNs to identify regional differences.Results:Salience (SAL) and parietal memory networks (PMNs) differentiated individuals by HIV status. When comparing controls with PLWH CN, the PMN and SAL had the strongest predictive strength across all ages. When comparing controls with PLWH CI, the SAL, PMN, and frontal parietal network (FPN) were the best predictors. When comparing PLWH CN with PLWH CI, the SAL, FPN, basal ganglia, and ventral attention were the strongest predictors. Only minor variability in predictive strength was observed with aging. Anatomically, differences in RSN topology occurred primarily in the dorsal and rostral lateral prefrontal cortex, cingulate, and caudate.Conclusion:Machine learning identified RSNs that classified individuals by HIV status and cognitive status. The PMN and SAL were sensitive for discriminating HIV status, with involvement of FPN occurring with cognitive impairment. Minor differences in RSN predictive strength were observed by age.

The environmental responses underlying these changes remain poorly understood. A 21-year field study (1997–2018) in a Costa Rican rainforest has produced the first multi-decade record of landscape-scale annual aboveground productivity for a tropical ecosystem. While none of the four production components (wood production; leaf-, twig-, and reproductive litterfall) increased over two decades, all significantly varied among years. Multi-factor environmental models explained a large fraction of the inter-year changes in two production components. Annual changes in three climatic factors and [CO2] jointly accounted for 84% of the variation in annual wood production. While the strongest response of wood production was to decline in years of slightly warmer nights, it also significantly declined in years with more dry-season hours hotter than 28°C. The yearly changes in reproductive litterfall were largely (52%) determined by the combined effects of increasing [CO2] and declining annual radiation. Twig litterfall declined over the 21 years. Annual leaf litterfall, the largest component of field-assessed aboveground production, showed no significant environmental responses. An extreme storm in the study's final year disrupted the environmental controls on production that prevailed through the prior 20 years.

There has been published research regarding the functional trait diversity of urban bee pollinators. However, no two cities are identical, so the implementation of multi-city studies is vital. Therefore, we compared body size variation in female Halicus ligatus sweat bees from May–October 2016 from three distinct Midwestern United States cities: Chicago, Detroit, and Saint Louis. Additionally, to elucidate potentially influential environmental factors, we assessed the relationship between temperature and measured body size. We collected bees in community gardens and urban farms and measured their head width and intertegular distance as a proxy for overall body size. We utilized an ANCOVA to determine whether body size variation differed significantly across the three surveyed cities. Results indicated that H. ligatus females in Chicago, Detroit, and Saint Louis had significantly different body size ranges. These findings highlight the importance of intraspecific body size variation and support our pre-diction that bees from different urban environments will have distinct ranges in body size due to local ecological factors affecting their populations. Additionally, we found a significant influence of temperature, though this is probably not the only important ecological characteristic impacting bee body size.

This study deploys the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to understand what influences police intentions to make discretionary referrals to treatment and harm reduction resources rather than arrest on less serious charges. Methods: On-line surveys integrating TPB constructs and adapting an instrument measuring police intentions to make mental health treatment referrals were completed by police employees in Indiana, Massachusetts, and Missouri. They also included items about stigma towards PWUD and attitudes and beliefs about opioid addiction, treatment, and recovery. Findings: Across the sites, 259 respondents perceived control over their decision to arrest for misdemeanors (69%) and confiscate items such as syringes (56%). Beliefs about others’ approval of referrals to treatment, its ability to reduce future arrests, and to increase trust in police were associated with stated practices of nonarrest for drug and possession and making referrals (p ≤.001), and nonarrest for syringe possession (p ≤.05). Stigma a towards PWUD was negatively associated with stated practices of nonarrest (p ≤.05). Respondents identified supervisors as having the most influence over use of discretion, seriousness of the offense as the most influential value, and attitude of the suspect as the most important situational factor. The 17 Likert scale items analyzed had a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.81. Conclusion: The TPB offers untapped potential to better understand and modify police practices.

However, due to heterogeneity of applications, it is a significant challenge for the edge cloud to effectively allocate multidimensional limited resources (CPU, memory, storage, bandwidth, etc.) with constraints of applications' Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. In this paper, we address the resource allocation problem in Edge-IoT systems through developing a novel framework named DeepEdge that allocates resources to the heterogeneous IoT applications with the goal of maximizing users' Quality of Experience (QoE). To achieve this goal, we develop a novel QoE model that considers aligning the heterogeneous requirements of IoT applications to the available edge resources. The alignment is achieved through selection of QoS requirement range that can be satisfied by the available resources. In addition, we propose a novel two-stage deep reinforcement learning (DRL) scheme that effectively allocates edge resources to serve the IoT applications and maximize the users' QoE. Unlike the typical DRL, our scheme exploits deep neural networks (DNN) to improve actions' exploration by using DNN to map the Edge-IoT state to joint resource allocation action that consists of resource allocation and QoS class. The joint action not only maximize users' QoE and satisfies heterogeneous applications' requirements but also align the QoS requirements to the available resources. In addition, we develop a Q-value approximation approach to tackle the large space problem of Edge-IoT. Further evaluation shows that DeepEdge brings considerable improvements in terms of QoE, latency and application tasks' success ratio in comparison to the existing resource allocation schemes.",,10.1109/TNSM.2021.3123959,19324537,3942,National Science Foundation,1909520,85118588167 (Scopus),,4,3954,2021-12-01,,https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSM.2021.3123959,IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management,18

Building upon the theoretical framework of Wright and Silard (2021), we examined seven theory-based predictors of feelings of isolation (six of which had not been examined in previous research). Using data from a sample of 244 telecommuters and their supervisors, we found support for five of the seven relationships we hypothesized. Specifically, we found feelings of isolation to be negatively related to whether individuals had a choice whether to telecommute and the length of the supervisor-telecommuter relationship. We found reports of feeling isolated to be positively associated with a telecommuter's need for affiliation, the extent of telecommuting, and the distance a telecommuter lived from the central workplace. As hypothesized, we also found telecommuter feelings of isolation were negatively related to telecommuter performance and job satisfaction.

Here, we explore this question in bumble bees, a group of eusocial insects where worker females and males exhibit stark socioecological differences. Among myriad colony maintenance tasks, workers forage for themselves and developing brood, while males forage only for themselves while mate-searching. Following upon previous studies suggesting no sex differences in bumble bee learning, we test the hypothesis that despite having equivalent associative learning abilities, males participate in cognitive assessments offering nutritional rewards at lower rates. Testing > 500 bees from nine colonies in a differential conditioning protocol, we find support for our hypothesis. An equivalent proportion of workers and males successfully completed our cognitive assessment, while a significantly lower proportion of males participated in the entire protocol.

DFT calculations and EPR measurements support an unconventional mechanism whereby strong AlH3 binding to bipyridine results in single-electron transfer to form AlH2(AlH3)n clusters.

In this qualitative study, 28 police officers were interviewed regarding their readiness to accept the roles to implement restorative justice through the exploration of three key themes: ownership of crime, police culture, and acceptance of new roles. Our findings indicated that their readiness on the implementation of restorative justice appeared to have patterns which are categorized into cautious, in-the-box, and balanced. The different patterns of readiness provide illumination into implementing restorative policing in Malaysia through the different types of resistance shown.

Amid large uncertainties that arise when generalizing from local and regional findings, hierarchical approaches applied to global datasets are required to determine whether drivers of parasite infection patterns vary across scales. We assessed global patterns of haemosporidian infections across a broad diversity of avian host clades and zoogeographical realms to depict hotspots of prevalence and to identify possible underlying drivers. Location: Global. Time period: 1994–2019. Major taxa studied: Avian haemosporidian parasites (genera Plasmodium, Haemoproteus, Leucocytozoon and Parahaemoproteus). Methods: We amalgamated infection data from 53,669 individual birds representing 2,445 species world-wide. Spatio-phylogenetic hierarchical Bayesian models were built to disentangle potential landscape, climatic and biotic drivers of infection probability while accounting for spatial context and avian host phylogenetic relationships. Results: Idiosyncratic responses of the three most common haemosporidian genera to climate, habitat, host relatedness and host ecological traits indicated marked variation in host infection rates from local to global scales. Notably, host ecological drivers, such as migration distance for Plasmodium and Parahaemoproteus, exhibited predominantly varying or even opposite effects on infection rates across regions, whereas climatic effects on infection rates were more consistent across realms. Moreover, infections in some low-prevalence realms were disproportionately concentrated in a few local hotspots, suggesting that regional-scale variation in habitat and microclimate might influence transmission, in addition to global drivers. Main conclusions: Our hierarchical global analysis supports regional-scale findings showing the synergistic effects of landscape, climate and host ecological traits on parasite transmission for a cosmopolitan and diverse group of avian parasites. Our results underscore the need to account for such interactions, in addition to possible variation in drivers across regions, to produce the robust inference required to predict changes in infection risk under future scenarios.",,10.1111/geb.13390,14668238,2393,National Science Foundation,2011‐01‐168524,85114332306 (Scopus),1466822X,12,2406,2021-12-01,,https://doi.org/10.1111/geb.13390,Global Ecology and Biogeography,30

However, much less is known about how the emergence of the gradients themselves shape the evolution of species that underlie community assembly. In this study, we address how the creation of novel environments leads to community assembly via two nonmutually exclusive processes: immigration and ecological sorting of pre-adapted clades (ISPC), and recent adaptive diversification (RAD). We study these processes in the context of the elevational gradient created by the uplift of the Central Andes. We develop a novel approach and method based on the decomposition of species turnover into within- and among-clade components, where clades correspond to lineages that originated before mountain uplift. Effects of ISPC and RAD can be inferred from how components of turnover change with elevation. We test our approach using data from over 500 Andean forest plots. We found that species turnover between communities at different elevations is dominated by the replacement of clades that originated before the uplift of the Central Andes. Our results suggest that immigration and sorting of clades pre-adapted to montane habitats is the primary mechanism shaping tree communities across elevations.",,10.1111/nph.17674,14698137,2506,National Science Foundation,DEB 0101775,85113923214 (Scopus),0028646X,6,2519,2021-12-01,34379801.0,https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.17674,New Phytologist,232

Supporting intentional family planning can have multiple health benefits and reduce harms related to OUD but requires a comprehensive understanding of women’s perspectives of preventing unintended pregnancies. The purpose of this study was to comprehensively evaluate the knowledge, attitudes and experiences as they relate to seeking contraception, particularly LARCs, among women with active or recovered opioid misuse. Methods: In-depth interviews and focus group discussions with 36 women with current or past opioid misuse were recorded and transcribed. Transcripts were coded by ≥ 2 investigators. Themes related to contraceptive care seeking were identified and contextualized within the Health Belief Model. Results: Our analysis revealed seven interwoven themes that describe individual level factors associated with contraceptive care seeking in women with current or past opioid misuse: relationship with drugs, reproductive experiences and self-perceptions, sexual partner dynamics, access, awareness of options, healthcare attitudes/experiences, and perceptions of contraception efficacy/ side effects. Overall, perceived susceptibility and severity to unintended pregnancy varied, but most women perceived high benefits of contraception, particularly LARC. However, perceived barriers were too high for most to obtain desired contraception to support family planning intentions. Conclusions: The individual-level factors identified should inform the design of integrated services to promote patient-centered contraceptive counseling as a form of harm reduction. Interventions should reduce barriers to contraceptive access, particularly LARCs, and establish counseling strategies that use open, non-judgmental communication, acknowledge the continuum of reproductive needs, explore perceived susceptibility to pregnancy, and utilize peer educators.",83,10.1186/s12954-021-00532-1,14777517,,National Institutes of Health,UL1 TR002366,85111960019 (Scopus),,1,,2021-12-01,34348734.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12954-021-00532-1,Harm Reduction Journal,18

This study examines the relationship between perceived police brutality and unmet need for mental health care. Data Sources: We used the 2018 Survey of the Health of Urban Residents (N = 4338), a quota sample survey of adults in urban areas in the contiguous United States. Study Design: Multivariate regressions were used to understand the association between police brutality and unmet need for mental health care. Unmet need was regressed on police brutality (the independent variable), controlling for sociodemographic and health status characteristics of respondents and access to care. We then stratified the sample by experiences of police brutality (no negative encounters with the police, encounters that were perceived as necessary, and encounters that were considered unnecessary) and described how medical mistrust and perceived respect within health care settings were associated with odds of unmet need for each subsample. Data Collection: Data were collected online. Principal Findings: Negative police encounters perceived as necessary were associated with greater odds of unmet need compared to no negative police encounters (odds ratio [OR] = 1.98, confidence interval [CI] = 1.30–2.65). Odds of unmet need were also higher among persons with negative and unnecessary police encounters (OR = 1.28, CI = 1.05–1.56). Greater respect was associated with lower odds of unmet need among persons who reported negative unnecessary encounters with the police (OR = 0.88, CI = 0.72–0.97). Medical mistrust was associated with greater odds of unmet need among those with negative unnecessary police encounters (OR = 1.52, CI = 1.12–1.93).

This excess burden is driven by structural and economic inequities. Microeconomic interventions may be effective strategies for reducing HIV inequities for this population. However, few studies have explored transgender women’s preferences for microeconomic interventions to address structural determinants of HIV vulnerability. Methods: We conducted individual interviews with 19 adult transgender women in 2 U.S. cities (Richmond, VA and St. Louis, MO) who reported one or more sexual risk behaviors and recent economic hardship related to employment/income, housing, or food security. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic content analysis. Results: The majority (74%) of transgender women were racial/ethnic minorities with mean age of 26.3 years. 89% were currently economically vulnerable; and 23% were employed full-time. 37% reported living with HIV. Participants expressed strong support for unrestricted vouchers, with many expressing the need for funds to support gender-affirming interventions. Assistance with how to budget and save and support for job acquisition, career planning, and employment sustainment were also preferred, including access to non-stigmatizing employment. Visible transgender leadership, group empowerment, and small (rather than large) numbers of participants were considered important aspects of intervention design for transgender women, including outreach through existing transgender networks to facilitate inclusion. Incorporating HIV counseling and testing to reduce vulnerability to HIV was acceptable. However, transgender women enrolled in the study preferred that HIV not be the focus of an intervention. Conclusions: Flexible microeconomic interventions that support gender affirming interventions, improve financial literacy, and provide living-wage non-stigmatizing employment are desired by economically vulnerable transgender women.

Qualitative studies of communities of practice can be difficult to empirically link to identity and self-efficacy in larger samples. In this study, we operationalized teacher communities of practice as specific networks related to teaching content and/or pedagogy. This scalable approach allowed us to quantitatively describe communities of practice and explore statistical relationships with other teacher characteristics. We asked whether these community of practice networks were related to identity and self-efficacy, similar to other conceptualizations of communities of practice. Results: We analyzed survey data from 165 in-service K-12 teachers prepared in science or mathematics at 5 university sites across the USA. Descriptive statistics and exploratory factor analyses indicated that math teachers consistently reported smaller communities of practice and lower identity and self-efficacy scores. Correlations revealed that communities of practice are more strongly and positively related to identity than self-efficacy. Conclusion: We demonstrate that teacher communities of practice can be described as networks. These community of practice networks are correlated with teacher identity and self-efficacy, similar to published qualitative descriptions of communities of practice. Community of practice networks are therefore a useful research tool for evaluating teacher characteristics such as discipline, identity, self-efficacy, and other possible outcomes (e.g., retention).

However, microaggressions only tell part of the story. An often-overlooked component of inequality is the uneven and unjust distribution of microaffirmations. In this paper, I give a new definition of microaffirmations as signals that a recipient belongs to some valued or high-status class. Microaffirmations can—but need not—lead individuals to gain a sense of confidence, belonging, and merit. I then explain the harms of microaffirmations, arguing that when microaffirmations are distributed inequitably, they can have larger ramifications for injustice, harming some vulnerable groups more than others. In addition, microaffirmations can lead individual actors to make choices based on who gives them microaffirmations and where they receive them, and thus can have outsized influence over the direction of an individual’s life because individuals tend to migrate to where they feel valued, appreciated, and included. I then turn to solutions to the problems I raise. I argue we should attend to and attempt to rectify inequalities in microaffirmations because doing so can help ensure not just the absence of negative attention, but also that the presence of positive attention is flowing in a just and equitable way.",,10.1007/s40926-021-00169-x,20529597,411,,,85102192465 (Scopus),17403812,4,429,2021-12-01,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40926-021-00169-x,Philosophy of Management,20

A hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using Ward's method in order to group patients with similar psychological characteristics, which were defined by taking into consideration the scores of the following tests: Sense Of Coherence, Health Behavior Scale (physical exercise score), Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale, Illness Perception Questionnaire, Satisfaction with Life Scale and the Visual Analogue Scale scores of the EQ-5D perceived health scale and a linear analogue scale (0–100) measuring QoL. Results: 3768 patients with complete data were divided into 3 clusters.

Distance prediction comes in two forms: real-valued distances and ‘binned’ distograms, which are a more finely grained variant of the binary contact prediction problem. The latter has been introduced as a new challenge in the 14th Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP14) 2020 experiment. Despite the recent proliferation of methods for predicting distances, few methods exist for evaluating these predictions. Currently only numerical metrics, which evaluate the entire prediction at once, are used. These give no insight into the structural details of a prediction. For this reason, new methods and tools are needed. Results: We have developed a web server for evaluating predicted inter-residue distances. Our server, DISTEVAL, accepts predicted contacts, distances, and a true structure as optional inputs to generate informative heatmaps, chord diagrams, and 3D models. All of these outputs facilitate visual and qualitative assessment. The server also evaluates predictions using other metrics such as mean absolute error, root mean squared error, and contact precision.

To examine leadership’s impact on the work–family interface, we draw on conservation of resources theory (COR) and crossover theory and investigate how authoritarian leadership and benevolent leadership affect spousal family satisfaction. We examine the mediating influence of work–family conflict (WFC) and work-family facilitation (WFF), and the moderating impact of spouses’ need for control. Our model was tested with multisource, mutiwave data from 207 Chinese married dyads. The results suggest that, as expected, the positive relationship between benevolent leadership and spousal family satisfaction is fully mediated by WFF, and the negative relationship between authoritarian leadership and spousal family satisfaction is fully mediated by WFC. Findings further suggest that the negative relationship between employee WFC and spousal family satisfaction is stronger for spouses with a higher need for control. Thus, authoritarian leadership, through its negative influence on WFC appears to be universally detrimental for spousal family satisfaction, however, even more so for spouses with a higher need for control.

Accelerated Brain Aging and Cerebral Blood Flow Reduction in Persons with Human Immunodeficiency Virus,OA,-,-,-,Green Final OA,-,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab169,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85120989801,"Aging, Arterial spin labeling, Brain-predicted age, Cerebral blood flow, HIV","Background: Persons with human immunodeficiency virus (PWH) are characterized by altered brain structure and function. As they attain normal lifespans, it has become crucial to understand potential interactions between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and aging. However, it remains unclear how brain aging varies with viral load (VL). Methods: In this study, we compare magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers among PWH with undetectable VL (UVL; ≤50 genomic copies/mL; n = 230), PWH with detectable VL (DVL; >50 copies/mL; n = 93), and HIV-uninfected (HIV-) controls (n = 206). To quantify gray matter cerebral blood flow (CBF), we utilized arterial spin labeling. To measure structural aging, we used a publicly available deep learning algorithm to estimate brain age from T1-weighted MRI. Cognitive performance was measured using a neuropsychological battery covering 5 domains. Results: Associations between age and CBF varied with VL. Older PWH with DVL had reduced CBF vs PWH with UVL (P =. 02). Structurally predicted brain aging was accelerated in PWH vs HIV- controls regardless of VL (P <. 001). Overall, PWH had impaired learning, executive function, psychomotor speed, and language compared to HIV- controls. Structural brain aging was associated with reduced psychomotor speed (P <. 001). Conclusions: Brain aging in HIV is multifaceted. CBF depends on age and current VL and is improved by medication adherence. By contrast, structural aging is an indicator of cognitive function and reflects serostatus rather than current VL.",,10.1093/cid/ciab169,15376591,1813,National Institute of Mental Health,R01MH118031,85120989801 (Scopus),10584838,10,1821,2021-11-15,33621317.0,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab169,Clinical Infectious Diseases,73

While PTSD rates are twice as high in women compared to men, sex differences in autonomic functioning are relatively unknown among trauma-exposed populations. The current study used a prospective design to examine sex differences in posttraumatic autonomic functioning. Methods: 192 participants were recruited from emergency departments following trauma exposure (Mean age = 35.88, 68.2% female). Skin conductance was measured in the emergency department; fear conditioning was completed two weeks later and included measures of blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and high frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV). PTSD symptoms were assessed 8 weeks after trauma. Results: 2-week systolic BP was significantly higher in men, while 2-week HR was significantly higher in women, and a sex by PTSD interaction suggested that women who developed PTSD demonstrated the highest HR levels. Two-week HF-HRV was significantly lower in women, and a sex by PTSD interaction suggested that women with PTSD demonstrated the lowest HF-HRV levels. Skin conductance response in the emergency department was associated with 2-week HR and HF-HRV only among women who developed PTSD. Conclusions: Our results indicate that there are notable sex differences in autonomic functioning among trauma-exposed individuals. Differences in sympathetic biomarkers (BP and HR) may have implications for cardiovascular disease risk given that sympathetic arousal is a mechanism implicated in this risk among PTSD populations.

It centres on three interconnected issues of decolonization: migration, statecraft and humanitarianism. Forced migration was integral to post-colonial statecraft, as both colonial and independent actors used displacement to construct their imagined nation state. In this case, the spatial ordering of politics, which focused on securing the profitable interior, departs from conventional narratives about refugees and nation-building. The colonial authorities in Kenya attempted to move Gikuyu not because of their ethnic or religious identity, but because they were poor and made populist claims to land. The withdrawing colonial power partnered with the post-colonial Tanzanian government and with humanitarian agencies. Through their involvement in this programme, aid agencies continued a long tradition of engaging in forced resettlement, and the relief they offered diminished the effectiveness of migrants' claims to return to Kenya. Despite the power of the institutions involved, landless Gikuyu made compelling claims in the language of human rights, and local politicians encouraged dissent, while at the national level, Kenyan officials, by then part of an interim state, refused to support the programme publicly, illustrating the complexities of shared governance and bureaucracy at the end of empire.",,10.1093/pastj/gtab005,1477464X,301,,,85121217919 (Scopus),00312746,1,337,2021-11-01,,https://doi.org/10.1093/pastj/gtab005,Past and Present,253

In this context, a hypothesis was tested that there must be vegetation dominated by unique indicator plant species under the influence of ecological gradients in the ecotonal zone of Manoor Valley (northwestern Himalaya), Pakistan. Keeping the aforementioned hypothesis in mind, detailed field studies were conducted during different seasons in 2015-18. Line transect sampling and phytosociological characteristics (density, frequency, cover, and their relative values and Importance Value) were implemented as ecological methods. This investigation documented 97 plant species recorded from seven sampling sites. The community distribution modelling revealed that the ecological variables separate the seven sampling sites into two major plant communities (Indigofera-Parrotiopsis-Bistorta and Ziziphus-Leptopus-Quercus) recognized by TWINSPAN. The IBP communities showed a positive and significant correlation with altitude (1789.6–1896.3 m), sandy soil texture with a slightly acidic pH (6.4–6.5), and higher phosphorous (9–13 mg kg−1 ). In contrast with this, the ZLQ community was recognized on the southern slope under the strong influence of high electrical conductivity (2.82–5.4 dsm−1 ), organic matter (1.08–1.25%), calcium carbonate (5.8–7.6 mg kg−1 ), potassium (202–220 mg kg−1 ), and temperature (28.8–31.8◦ C). Hence, both communities were found on opposite axes with clear differences based on the ecological gradients. NMDS clustered different species with similar habitats and different stands with common species, showing that plant species and stands were in a linear combination with ecological gradients. The IPB community has the maximum number of plant species (87 species), Shannon value (H’ = 4), Simpson value (0.98), and Pielou’s evenness value (0.96).

Accurately identifying patients at high risk in the ED would facilitate the targeting of preventive interventions. Objectives: To develop and validate a prediction tool based on ED reports after a motor vehicle collision to predict PTSD or MDE 3 months later. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Advancing Understanding of Recovery After Trauma (AURORA) study is a longitudinal study that examined adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequalae among patients who presented to 28 US urban EDs in the immediate aftermath of a traumatic experience. Enrollment began on September 25, 2017. The 1003 patients considered in this diagnostic/prognostic report completed 3-month assessments by January 31, 2020. Each patient received a baseline ED assessment along with follow-up self-report surveys 2 weeks, 8 weeks, and 3 months later.

Main Outcomes and Measures: The PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 was used to assess PTSD and the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Depression Short-Form 8b to assess MDE. Results: A total of 1003 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 34.5 [24-43] years; 715 [weighted 67.9%] female; 100 [weighted 10.7%] Hispanic, 537 [weighted 52.7%] non-Hispanic Black, 324 [weighted 32.2%] non-Hispanic White, and 42 [weighted 4.4%] of non-Hispanic other race or ethnicity were included in this study. A total of 274 patients (weighted 26.6%) met criteria for 3-month PTSD or MDE. An ensemble machine learning model restricted to 30 predictors estimated in a training sample (patients from the Northeast or Midwest) had good prediction accuracy (mean [SE] area under the curve [AUC], 0.815 [0.031]) and calibration (mean [SE] integrated calibration index, 0.040 [0.002]; mean [SE] expected calibration error, 0.039 [0.002]) in an independent test sample (patients from the South). Patients in the top 30% of predicted risk accounted for 65% of all 3-month PTSD or MDE, with a mean (SE) positive predictive value of 58.2% (6.4%) among these patients at high risk. The model had good consistency across regions of the country in terms of both AUC (mean [SE], 0.789 [0.025] using the Northeast as the test sample and 0.809 [0.023] using the Midwest as the test sample) and calibration (mean [SE] integrated calibration index, 0.048 [0.003] using the Northeast as the test sample and 0.024 [0.001] using the Midwest as the test sample; mean [SE] expected calibration error, 0.034 [0.003] using the Northeast as the test sample and 0.025 [0.001] using the Midwest as the test sample). The most important predictors in terms of Shapley Additive Explanations values were symptoms of anxiety sensitivity and depressive disposition, psychological distress in the 30 days before motor vehicle collision, and peritraumatic psychosomatic symptoms.

Objective: The present study sought to determine whether higher levels of child-reported PTSS, as well as the specific DSM-IV PTSD symptom clusters, predicted attrition from trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT). Participants/setting/method: One hundred and seventy one children ages 7–18 (M = 11.76, SD = 2.71; 67.4% female; 55.8% Black) were included in the study from an archival database. Dropout was investigated by two operational definitions: 1) clinician-rated dropout, and 2) whether the child received an adequate dose of treatment (i.e., 12 or more sessions). Results: Sixty eight percent (68.4%) of the children prematurely terminated treatment per their clinician, yet 70.2% received an adequate treatment dose. Child's age and income were related to clinician-rated attrition, but PTSS did not correspond with either attrition definition. None of the PTSD symptom clusters were associated with clinician-rated dropout; however, higher levels of avoidance symptoms were tied to increased likelihood of the child receiving an adequate dose of treatment.

Topiramate is thought to reduce substance use by attenuating craving and the rewarding effects of acute substance use through its concurrent GABAergic agonism and glutamatergic antagonism. Importantly, topiramate also impacts mood states central to many models of substance use. Despite this, little previous research has examined whether topiramate attenuates the respective associations of affect and craving with substance use. Objectives: We conducted a secondary analysis of 63 youths that exhibited heavy cannabis use, aged 15–24 years, who were randomized in a double-blinded 6-week clinical trial comparing the effects of topiramate (up to 200 mg/day) and placebo on cannabis use. Ecological momentary assessment data were leveraged to model the role positive affect, negative affect, and craving on use over the 6-week period and whether topiramate attenuated associations between these feeling states and cannabis use. Results: Findings showed that craving was positively associated with use at the within-person level, while positive affect was negatively associated with use at the between-person level. Topiramate appears to attenuate the negative association of between-person positive affect (i.e., average) and cannabis use. Specifically, those in the placebo condition exhibited this inverse association between average positive affect and use while those in topiramate condition did not. No other significant affect or affect × medication condition interactions were observed. Conclusions: These findings implicate craving and low positive affect as important risk factors for cannabis use in youth in treatment.

Within the large, diverse (600 species) genus Passiflora is an especially enigmatic and species-rich (120 spp.) subclade, Section Decaloba, which occurs in the Neotropics and has its center of diversity in Andean montane forests. A recent phylogenetic study of Passifloraceae showed that Section Decaloba was monophyletic, but was unable to resolve relationships within the clade, thus preventing inferences of evolutionary history and biogeography. The goal of this study was to elucidate the phylogeny and biogeography of Section Decaloba. We sampled 206 accessions representing 91 of the ~ 120 known species in section Decaloba and four outgroups, with samples derived predominantly from herbarium specimens. We generated DNA sequences using a high-throughput DNA sequencing technique called 2b-RAD, reconstructed the phylogeny, and conducted ancestral area reconstructions to infer the biogeographic history of the group. We recovered predominantly well-supported trees in which species were grouped into two main clades: 1) the Central American clade, within which the majority of nodes well supported and species were monophyletic and 2) the South American clade, a large clade that showed overall lower resolution and included several polyphyletic species and species complexes that need additional research. RASP analysis showed that section Decaloba originated in Central America around 10.4 Ma, and then dispersed to South America, the Greater Antilles, and the Bahamas. The South American clade diversified in the Northern Andes and then dispersed to the rest of South America, and Lesser Antilles. Results suggest that both long-distance dispersal and colonization of newly available habitats (i.e., in the Andes) likely promoted diversification of this clade. This study also illustrates how using herbarium specimens and a RAD-seq approach can produce phylogenies for broadly distributed, highly diverse, and poorly accessible groups of plants where field collections would be unfeasible.",107260,10.1016/j.ympev.2021.107260,10959513,,Saint Louis University,,85111508900 (Scopus),10557903,,,2021-11-01,34273502.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2021.107260,Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution,164

In a very recent paper “Direct signal separation via extraction of local frequencies with adaptive time-varying parameters”, the authors obtained a more accurate component recovery formula derived from the linear chirp (also called linear frequency modulation signal) approximation at any local time. However the theoretical analysis of the recovery formula derived from linear chirp local approximation has not been studied there. In this paper, we carry out the analysis of SSO based on the adaptive short-time Fourier transform (STFT). We study both the sinusoidal signal-based model and the linear chirp-based model, and obtain the error bounds for the instantaneous frequency estimation and component recovery. The error bounds are derived by studying the approximation to the STFT of each component and by the assumption of the decrease of the Fourier transform of the window function for STFT. These results provide a mathematical guarantee to the proposed adaptive STFT-based non-stationary multicomponent signal separation method.

Women who had experienced miscarriage (n = 227) were recruited via social media and completed an online survey that assessed their disclosure, positive social reactions following disclosure, event-related rumination, and posttraumatic growth (PTG). Loss context factors and demographics were also collected. Hypotheses were tested via hierarchical multiple regression and PROCESS macro. The results indicated that disclosure and positive social reactions predicted PTG and that the relationship between positive social reactions and PTG was mediated by deliberate rumination.

Prior research suggests that fair value estimates for goodwill must be inferred from other available information because of the nature of goodwill, including its intangibility. Such inferences are highly discretionary and may limit the usefulness of reported goodwill estimates. Because Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142 relies exclusively on fair value estimates to subsequently measure goodwill, reported values considering management's increased discretion may be less reliable and less value relevant when presented in conjunction with other accounting information. However, the subsequent accounting measurement for goodwill is not dissimilar from the subsequent measurement for long-lived tangible assets, which are also subject to impairment. In general, impairment measurement is subjective; management may have greater insight, even in the presence of management incentives and other accounting information, that may help confirm or disconfirm investors’ own goodwill estimates. Using other accounting information and long-lived tangible assets as benchmarks for the value relevance of goodwill, we find that reported goodwill provides greater value relevance relative to other accounting information after SFAS 142 and that the difference between the value relevance of goodwill and other long-lived tangible assets is also significantly greater following SFAS 142.",106906,10.1016/j.jaccpubpol.2021.106906,18732070,,,,85118760111 (Scopus),02784254,6,,2021-10-01,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaccpubpol.2021.106906,Journal of Accounting and Public Policy,40

The central nervous system (CNS) is a likely reservoir of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), vulnerable to viral rebound, inflammation, and clinical changes upon stopping antiretroviral therapy (ART). It is critical to evaluate the CNS safety of studies using analytic treatment interruption (ATI) to assess HIV remission. Methods. Thirty participants who started ART during acute HIV infection underwent CNS assessments across 4 ATI remission trials. ART resumption occurred with plasma viral load >1000 copies/mL. CNS measures included paired pre- vs post-ATI measures of mood, cognitive performance, and neurologic examination, with elective cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling, brain diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Results. Median participant age was 30 years old and 29/30 were male. Participants’ median time on ART before ATI was 3 years, and ATI lasted a median of 35 days. Post-ATI, there were no differences in median mood scores or neurologic findings and cognitive performance improved modestly. During ATI, a low level of CSF HIV-1 RNA was detectable in 6 of 20 participants with plasma viremia, with no group changes in CSF immune activation markers or brain DTI measures. Mild worsening was identified in post-ATI basal ganglia total choline MRS, suggesting an alteration in neuronal membranes. Conclusion. No adverse CNS effects were observed with brief, closely monitored ATI in participants with acutely treated HIV, except an MRS alteration in basal ganglia choline.

Our findings revealed that Ahmed positioned his students in three ways: as an inclusive classroom community, as readers and writers, and as language analysts. Likewise, the students took up roles as genre analysts, active language users, and engaged community members. The findings also demonstrated that Ahmed selectively deployed his linguistic resources in varieties of French and English to connect with his students, create community with them, and achieve his instructional goals within a translanguaging space (e.g., Tian, 2021; Wei, 2011).

We report rotational temperatures (Trot), production rates (Qs), abundance (mixing) ratios (relative to H2 O and C2H6), and spatial distributions in the coma. ER61 exhibits variability in production rates of many species on short (day-to-day) and long (pre- versus post-perihelion) timescales. The relative abundances of these volatile species remained consistent within uncertainties during our pre-perihelion observations but tended to decrease during our post-perihelion observations (with the exception of CH3OH and HCN). The short-timescale variability in the production rates of these volatiles could be due to diurnal effects (over the course of the rotation of the nucleus) and/or the effect of its outburst. The decrease in the production rates and hence the mixing ratios in some volatiles in post-perihelion dates could be due to the presence of seasonal effects in ER61.",145,10.3847/1538-3881/abfcbd,,,,,85116343157 (Scopus),00046256,4,,2021-10-01,,https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-3881/abfcbd,Astronomical Journal,162

Here, we use plant species within disjunct genera to examine whether differences in topography contribute to the diversity anomaly and whether the richness–environment relationships differ between regions. Disjunct plants are used to ensure that the diversity anomaly relates to post-disjunction evolution and diversification rather than regional differences in clade ages or immigration. Location: EAS and ENA. Time period: Current. Major taxa studied: Plant taxa disjunctly distributed in EAS and ENA. Methods: We compiled county-level plant distribution data, and calculated species richness and variables of topography and climate within unit grid cells. We compared estimated coefficients of region effects among models, where richness was fitted with or without topography and climate. Topography and climate were also used to separately model within-region spatial diversity patterns using spatial simultaneous autoregressive error models. Results: The coefficients of region effects varied from −.776 for the model only including region to −.309 when topography was controlled for, but remained significant. Climate dominated the spatial diversity patterns in ENA. In contrast, the influence of climate (14.2%) on species richness was weaker than that of topography (18.3%) in the warm area of EAS. Relations to elevation and temperature varied between regions, shifting between positive and negative relationships in several cases. Main conclusions: Our results demonstrate that variability in local topography contributes to the strong regional anomaly in plant species richness between EAS and ENA. Nevertheless, the diversity anomaly persists after controlling for local topography and climate. EAS and ENA also exhibit contrasting richness–environment relationships, providing another divergent aspect between the EAS–ENA disjunct floras.

The study then examined individual, family, and socioeconomic predictors of profile. Data were drawn from the Early Head Start Family and Child Experiences Study, a nationally-representative, prospective, longitudinal study of children assessed at ages 1, 2, and 3. The latent profile analyses suggested four distinct profiles of development at age 3: children who were well-adjusted, children with parent-reported behavior problems, children with staff-reported behavior problems, and children with multiple difficulties. Among the patterns of risk and protective factors, those in the profile with multiple difficulties were most likely to have missed early developmental milestones at age 1. Those in the parent-reported behavior problems profile experienced less supportive and more negative parenting, and had caregivers with higher levels of depressive symptoms than those who were well-adjusted. Those in the staff-reported behavior problems profile were more likely to be male as well as have higher levels of caregiver depressive symptoms.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often co-occurs with mTBI and predicts worse clinical outcomes. Functional neuroimaging research suggests there are both overlapping and distinct patterns of resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) in mTBI versus PTSD. However, few studies have directly compared rsFC of cortical networks in military service members with these two conditions. In the present study, U.S. service members (n = 137; ages 19–59; 120 male) underwent resting-state fMRI scans. Participants were divided into three study groups: mTBI only, PTSD only, and orthopedically injured (OI) controls. Analyses investigated group differences in rsFC for cortical networks: default mode (DMN), frontoparietal (FPN), salience, somatosensory, motor, auditory, and visual. Analyses were family-wise error (FWE) cluster-corrected and Bonferroni-corrected for number of network seeds regions at the whole brain level (pFWE < 0.002). Both mTBI and PTSD groups had reduced rsFC for DMN and FPN regions compared with OI controls. These group differences were largely driven by diminished connectivity in the PTSD group. rsFC with the middle frontal gyrus of the FPN was increased in mTBI, but decreased in PTSD. Overall, these results suggest that PTSD symptoms may have a more consistent signal than mTBI.

Yet, research community has largely treated them as separate problems and thus resulted in two entirely different sets of solutions, complicating both implementation and usage. In this paper, we present a stylistic image binarization method called hybrid difference of Gaussians (HDoG) that performs both line drawing and screentoning in a unified framework. Our method is based upon two different extensions of DoG operator: one for line extraction, and the other for tone description. In particular, we propose an extension called adaptive DoG, that uses luminance as weight to automatically generate screentone that adapts to the local tone.

Children reported using approximately eight types of coping strategies (M = 8.29, SD =2.50). Regression models indicated that internalized and angry coping were associated with child-reported PTSS. In contrast to expectations, none of the types of coping strategies were linked with caregiver’s reports of PTSS or internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Interestingly, perceived efficacy of coping was largely unrelated to symptoms, with only perceived efficacy of avoidant coping inversely related to child-reported PTSS. Perceived efficacy was not tied to caregiver’s reports of children’s symptoms. Coping strategies may be associated with children’s, but not caregiver’s, reports of children’s trauma-related difficulties. Furthermore, perceived efficacy of coping strategies may also be largely unrelated to children’s symptoms, or children may have limited insight regarding the efficacy of their coping strategies.

There are safety concerns for the locations in which hydrogen is made, used, and transported (i.e., pipelines and tanker trucks). Sensors are needed to comply with safety regulations and to enable a smooth and safe rollout of hydrogen as an alternative energy. However, hydrogen sensors do not yet exist that have the combined features of small size and low power for easy deployment coupled with high-volume manufacturability and low cost. This is necessary to accommodate the emerging fixed and mobile markets while retaining critical metrological metrics, including measurement range, detection limits, selectivity, fast response, stability, and long lifetime. An amperometric gas sensor for hydrogen (AGS) has been developed using an innovative manufacturing method. The sensor was designed using scalable fabrication strategies based on “Printed Electronics” (PE) methodology which are compatible with large-scale production. Prototype sensors were batch fabricated with multiple individual elements on a substrate compatible in size with a standard 8-inch wafer to enable high-volume, low-cost manufacturing, thereby leveraging PE and semiconductor fabrication infrastructure.

To disentangle a caterpillar species' shelter from the rest of its phenotype, we performed a field experiment in which two caterpillar species (Urbanus dorantes and U. proteus) were removed from their original shelters, placed into shelters made by conspecifics or heterospecifics, and monitored for predation and parasitism. Predation was intense, with 0-48% of caterpillars surviving depending on treatment. Shelter builder identity significantly affected predation independent of occupant identity, with caterpillars placed in U. proteus shelters experiencing higher predation than those in U. dorantes shelters. The effect of shelter builder identity was related to shelter type: shriveled leaf shelters built by U. dorantes had a lower risk of predation than cut-and-fold shelters built by either species. Cut-and-fold shelters built by the two species did not have significantly different shapes. Caterpillar stage also significantly affected predation (mid-instars were more successful than early instars), but caterpillar species identity did not. Surprisingly, parasitism was rare, but both shriveled leaf shelters and cut-and-fold shelters resulted in similar overall caterpillar mortality. The differences in predation and overall mortality between shelter types suggest a trade-off between protection from predators and parasitoids. This experiment demonstrates that shelter type determines the fate of the caterpillar inside, independent of the identity of the caterpillar that built the shelter.

But unlike the intrinsic spin of electrons, the lattice vibration is rarely rotational. To induce angular momentum, one needs to find a material that can accommodate a twisted normal mode, two orthogonal modes, or excitation of magnons. If excitation is too strong, one may exceed the Lindemann limit, so the material melts. Therefore these methods are not ideal. Here, we theoretically propose a route to phonon angular momentum in a molecular crystal C60. We find that a single laser pulse is able to inject a significant amount of angular momentum to C60, and the momentum transfer is helicity dependent. Changing from right-circularly polarized light to left-circularly polarized light switches the direction of phonon angular momentum. On the ultrafast timescale, the orbital angular momentum change closely resembles the displacive excitation of coherent phonons, with a cosine-function dependence on time, different from the spin counterpart. Atomic displacements, even under strong laser excitation, remain far below the Lindemann criterion. Under thermal excitation, spinning C60 even at room temperature generates a huge angular momentum close to several hundred. Our finding opens the door to a large group of fullerenes, from C60,C70 to their endohedral derivatives, where angular momentum can be generated through light or temperature.

Our findings suggest that bison reintroduction as a conservation strat-egy may be counterproductive in grassland fragments where overgrazing, trampling, and other negative impacts drive declines in grassland breeding birds. Where bird conservation is an objec- tive, small grassland reserves may therefore be inappropriate sites for bison reintroduction. To max-imize conservation benefits to birds, land managers should prioritize protecting grassland birds from disturbance during the bird breeding season.",2661,10.3390/ani11092661,20762615,,U.S. Geological Survey,,85114558292 (Scopus),,9,,2021-09-01,,https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11092661,Animals,11

However, systematic insights into the interconnections between institutional and cultural perspectives and their effects on entrepreneurship are severely lacking. In order to fill this gap, the current research integrates two prominent yet under-explored institutional and cultural factors: linguistic future-time reference (FTR) as an institutional factor and long-term orientation as a cultural factor, and considers how they are linked through the time perspective reflected in risk and uncertainty perception. Drawing upon linguistic relativity theory and cultural theory, we propose that institutions with strong FTR languages and cultures with short-term orientation are more likely to foster innovative new venture creation. We utilized merged, multi-level, and multi-source data of 34,673 entrepreneurs from 42 countries to test our hypotheses. We also conducted a series of scenario-based, intra-group experiments with bilingual entrepreneurs to further confirm that strong-FTR has a positive relationship with innovative new venture creation.

For immigrant youth, these perceptions also influence their developing sense of self and how they navigate different social contexts. Considering the growing diversity of immigrants and their places of settlement in the U.S., however, the empirical focus on native Whites’ perceptions of immigrant newcomers does not adequately reflect the range of potential in-group/out-group configurations. We know very little, for instance, about native minorities’ perceptions of White newcomers in different receiving contexts. The experience of Bosnian youth in St. Louis provides a unique case for examining perceptions of White newcomers in a nontraditional immigrant gateway, characterized by a sharp racial binary in its native population. Data for the present study includes i) qualitative interviews with 62 s-generation Bosnian youth and ii) a quantitative survey of non-Bosnian adult residents in St. Louis. Results show that overall, St. Louisians have positive views of Bosnians. This finding is complicated, however, by somewhat less favorable perceptions among Blacks than among Whites and the fact that most respondents indicated limited contact with Bosnians. In their interviews, Bosnian youth revealed that they use subtle cues such as mannerisms and shared cultural knowledge that are largely invisible to natives, to differentiate between groups.

We investigated subcortical brain volumes in regions supporting extinction learning and fear-potentiated startle (FPS) to understand brain-behavior interactions that may impact PTSD symptom development in recently traumatized individuals. Participants (N = 99) completed magnetic resonance imaging and threat conditioning two weeks following trauma exposure as part of a multisite observational study to understand the neuropsychiatric effects of trauma (AURORA Study). Participants completed self-assessments of PTSD (PTSD Checklist for DSM-5; PCL-5), dissociation, and depression symptoms two- and eight-weeks post-trauma. We completed multiple regressions to investigate relationships between FPS during late extinction, GMV, and PTSD symptom development. The interaction between thalamic GMV and FPS during late extinction at two weeks post-trauma predicted PCL-5 scores eight weeks (t (75) = 2.49, β = 0.28, p = 0.015) post-trauma. Higher FPS predicted higher PCL-5 scores in the setting of increased thalamic GMV. Meanwhile, lower FPS also predicted higher PCL-5 scores in the setting of decreased thalamic GMV.

In other words, not hiring African American nurse faculty removes the African American perspective in advancing the tripartite mission of teaching, research, and service in academic nursing. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of the interview process of African American faculty who sought employment in academic nursing. Method: This qualitative study, guided by Critical Race Theory (CRT), used face-to-face, semi-structured interviews to explore the feelings and perceptions of nine African American female nursing educators who sought employment in academic nursing. Results: Major themes that emerged from their stories associated with the interview process were the lack of clarity, lack of job security, lack of diversity within the nursing academy, and racism. Their stories provided a deeper understanding of the challenges, issues, and complexities experienced when navigating the interview process as they attempted to gain access to employment opportunities.

This study examined the role of the sibling-in-law in the social support networks of their brother/sister-in-law with IDD and factors associated with providing greater amounts of tangible, informational and emotional support. Method: Siblings-in-law of adults with IDD living predominately in the United States (N = 99) participated in a cross-sectional survey. Measures covered demographic and family background, perspectives towards having a brother/sister-in-law with IDD, supports provided and characteristics of the adult with IDD's social support network. Results: Most siblings-in-law reported providing support to their brother/sister-in-law with IDD. Percentages of siblings-in-law providing support were similar to that of the spouse and the spouse's family in the area of emotional support and similar to percentages of paid professionals in tangible and informational supports. Across all three support types, the main predictor of increased sibling-in-law support levels was a decreased ability of the parents-in-law to care for their child with IDD.

The main idea is to incorporate a chirp rate parameter with the time-scale continuous wavelet-like transformation, by considering the quadratic phase representation of the signal components. Hence-forth, even if two IF curves cross, the two corresponding signal components can still be separated and recovered, provided that their chirp rates are different. In other words, signal components with the same IF value at any time instant could still be recovered. To facilitate our presentation, we introduce the notion of time-scale-chirp_rate (TSC_R) recovery transform or TSC_R recovery operator to develop a TSC_R theory for the 3-dimensional space of time, scale, chirp rate. Our theoretical development is based on the approximation of the non-stationary signal components with linear chirps and applying the proposed adaptive TSC_R transform to the multi-component blind-source signal to obtain fairly accurate error bounds of IF estimations and signal components recovery.

However, because capacity is not verifiable, the firms cannot commit to firm contract terms. Bearing the upfront investment cost, the supplier under-builds specific capacity and under-invests in the cost-reduction innovation, thereby lowering supply chain efficiency. A common arrangement is that the parties agree to some initial contract terms ex ante, and may renegotiate ex post. This paper investigates whether several common types of contract can induce the supplier to build specialized capacity and invest in cos-reduction innovation at the first-best levels, and how ex post renegotiation affects the results. Under quantity-only contracts, the supplier will over-invest in cost-reduction innovation but under-build specific capacity either with or without ex post renegotiation. Under price-only contracts, the supplier will under-invest in cost-reduction innovation but over-build specific capacity. Ex post renegotiation improves the channel profit and brings the supplier's decisions closer to the firstbest, but its decisions remain suboptimal. However, there exist one quantity-plus-price initial agreement and a schedule of option contracts that yield the first-best decisions. The price/quantities do not change whether ex post renegotiation is permissible. However, channel efficiency and the firms’ profits improve when ex post renegotiation is permissible. Because of the flexibility of option contracts, the firms renegotiate only if the buyer exercises up options and wants to buy more ex post, while they renegotiate with certainty under the optimal quantity-plus-price initial contract.",102417,10.1016/j.omega.2021.102417,,,,,85100102609 (Scopus),03050483,,,2021-09-01,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.omega.2021.102417,Omega (United Kingdom),103

Using a matched sample of fraud-restatement, error-restatement and non-restatement U.S. firms between 1996 and 2010, we find that relations-oriented diversity is associated with a lower incidence of fraud-related restatements, while task-oriented diversity is associated with a lower likelihood of error-related restatements.

We used ecological momentary assessment to examine the effects of DTC during daily-life drinking episodes in a sample of current drinkers (N = 110; 52 individuals with borderline personality disorder and 58 community individuals). Multilevel models were used to test whether momentary and episode-level endorsement of DTC-depression and DTC-anxiety motives would be related to increased subjective drinking-contingent relief and decreased depression and anxiety during drinking episodes. Momentary DTC-anxiety predicted greater subsequent drinking-contingent relief, and greater episode-level DTC-anxiety and DTC-depression predicted greater drinking-contingent relief during the episode. However, we did not find decreased depression and anxiety following endorsement of DTC-depression and DTC-anxiety. Instead, we found that greater episode-level DTC-depression was associated with increased depression. Thus, findings suggest that individuals’ negative affective states may not improve during DTC despite endorsing drinking-contingent relief. This discrepancy warrants further attention because subjective relief likely reinforces DTC, whereas awareness of one’s change (or lack of change) in affect may provide valuable counterevidence for whether alcohol use is an effective coping strategy.

The current study of weekly offense rates in large U.S. cities is based on a longer time period, a greater number of offenses than prior research, and a varying number of cities for each offense (max = 28, min = 13, md = 20). We find that weekly property crime and drug offense rates, averaged across the cities, fell during the pandemic. An exception is motor vehicle theft, which trended upward after pandemic-related population restrictions were instituted in March 2020. Robbery rates also declined immediately after the pandemic began. Average weekly homicide, aggravated assault, and gun assault rates did not exhibit statistically significant increases after March. Beginning in June 2020, however, significant increases in these offenses were detected, followed by declines in the late summer and fall. Fixed-effects regression analyses disclose significant decreases in aggravated assault, robbery, and larceny rates associated with reduced residential mobility during the pandemic. These results support the routine activity hypothesis that the dispersion of activity away from households increases crime rates. The results for the other offenses are less supportive.

Methods: Fifty non-U.S. Spanish-speaking therapists completed a survey related to their use of telecommunication modalities; client population characteristics; professional, ethical, and legal/regulatory issues; and telehealth training and practice. Participants completed the survey at one time point and retrospectively described their use of telehealth both pre-pandemic and during the pandemic.

In the first phase, we identify and label the pixels that are likely to be corrupted by the impulse noise. In the second phase, the image is restored through the unlabeled observed data. The restored image is achieved via solving an optimization problem whose objective function has an ℓ 1/ℓ 2 combined content-dependent fidelity term and a nonconvex nonlocal low-rank regularization term. Both terms are built on patch matrices formed from similar patches. Each patch matrix is considered to be low-rank according to the prior knowledge of images. We solve this nonconvex optimization through an iterative adaptive nuclear norm minimization algorithm and provide its convergence analysis.

Our aim was to determine, in a South African cohort of PWH (N = 148), (a) how much variation in reported rates was due to method used to define cognitive impairment and (b) which method correlated best with MRI biomarkers of HIV-related brain pathology. Participants completed detailed neuropsychological assessment and underwent 3 T structural MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).

We used the neuroimaging data to obtain volumes for cortical and subcortical grey matter and total white matter and DTI metrics for several white matter tracts. Applying each of the 20 methods to the cognitive dataset resulted in a wide variation (20–97%) in estimated rates of impairment.

We investigated associations between CVD burden (presence of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, smoking history, and atrial fibrillation) and WMH with atrophy over time.Results:The mean (SD) age was 64.8 (4.3) years for PLWH and 66.4 (3.2) years for controls.

Accordingly, we used a 3.5-year record of seed deposition in pre-montane tropical wet forest in southern Costa Rica to examine how seed arrival differed between passive (natural regeneration) and active (applied nucleation, plantation) restoration after a decade of recovery, compared to remnant forest.

Overall seed rain composition and diversity in restoration treatments was converging towards, but still differed substantially from, remnant forest (89.7%, 86.6% and 76.3% Shannon diversity recovered in applied nucleation, plantation and natural regeneration respectively). Within-plot animal-dispersed seed heterogeneity was similar in applied nucleation and remnant forest, 27.0% more heterogeneous in applied nucleation than plantation, and equivalent when comparing natural regeneration to either applied nucleation or plantation. In contrast to active interventions, animal-dispersed tree and shrub communities did not differ year to year in natural regeneration, which may promote the assembly of relatively homogeneous plant communities at this successional stage. Synthesis and applications. Compared to natural regeneration, active restoration interventions: (a) catalysed the recovery of seed diversity (overall Shannon diversity 17.5% and 13.4% higher in applied nucleation and plantation respectively), (b) shifted seed community composition towards remnant forest more rapidly (overall Shannon diversity 13.4% and 10.2% closer), (c) almost doubled the proportion of later-successional tree species arriving, and (d) had seed communities that differed year to year—a pattern not observed in natural regeneration. Finally, applied nucleation was the only intervention where seed arrival was as spatially heterogeneous as remnant forest, highlighting that this approach may facilitate the recovery of specific natural dispersal processes.",,10.1111/1365-2664.13907,13652664,1693,National Science Foundation,DEB 05‐15577,85106011299 (Scopus),00218901,8,1704,2021-08-01,,https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.13907,Journal of Applied Ecology,58

One of the two experimentally predicted binding modes of HAD-β-CD/TB is confirmed by our approach and ascribed to the R-complex. R-TB is compactly included by HAD-β- CD: the aromatic ring is within the CD cavity, while the alkyl moiety is also included and almost parallel to the secondary rim of the CD. As indicated by the computed binding affinity, this tight binding mode of R-complex enhances the host–guest hydrophobic interaction and renders the R-complex significantly more stable than the S-complex.

However, recent landscape level anthropogenic changes may disrupt host-parasite systems by impacting functional and phylogenetic diversity of host communities. We examined whether changes in host functional and phylogenetic diversity, forest cover, and minimum temperature influence the prevalence, diversity, and distributions of avian haemosporidian parasites (genera Haemoproteus and Plasmodium) across 18 avian communities in the Atlantic Forest. To explore spatial patterns in avian haemosporidian prevalence and taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity, we surveyed 2241 individuals belonging to 233 avian species across a deforestation gradient. Mean prevalence and parasite diversity varied considerably across avian communities and parasites responded differently to host attributes and anthropogenic changes. Avian malaria prevalence (termed herein as an infection caused by Plasmodium parasites) was higher in deforested sites, and both Plasmodium prevalence and taxonomic diversity were negatively related to host functional diversity. Increased diversity of avian hosts increased local taxonomic diversity of Plasmodium lineages but decreased phylogenetic diversity of this parasite genus. Temperature and host phylogenetic diversity did not influence prevalence and diversity of haemosporidian parasites. Variation in the diversity of avian host traits that promote parasite encounter and vector exposure (host functional diversity) partially explained the variation in avian malaria prevalence and diversity. Recent anthropogenic landscape transformation (reduced proportion of native forest cover) had a major influence on avian malaria occurrence across the Atlantic Forest. This suggests that, for Plasmodium, host phylogenetic diversity was not a biotic filter to parasite transmission as prevalence was largely explained by host ecological attributes and recent anthropogenic factors. Our results demonstrate that, similar to human malaria and other vector-transmitted pathogens, prevalence of avian malaria parasites will likely increase with deforestation.",,10.1016/j.ijpara.2021.01.001,18790135,719,National Science Foundation,DEB-1503804,85103703362 (Scopus),00207519,9,728,2021-08-01,33722680.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2021.01.001,International Journal for Parasitology,51

We hypothesized that circadian rhythm changes, measured by a wrist-worn research watch are predictive of post-trauma outcomes. Approach: 1618 post-trauma patients were enrolled after admission to emergency departments (ED). Three standardized questionnaires were administered at week eight to measure post-trauma outcomes related to PTSD, sleep disturbance, and pain interference with daily life. Pulse activity and movement data were captured from a research watch for eight weeks. Standard and novel movement and cardiovascular metrics that reflect circadian rhythms were derived using this data. These features were used to train different classifiers to predict the three outcomes derived from week-eight surveys. Clinical surveys administered at ED were also used as features in the baseline models. Results: The highest cross-validated performance of research watch-based features was achieved for classifying participants with pain interference by a logistic regression model, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.70. The ED survey-based model achieved an AUC of 0.77, and the fusion of research watch and ED survey metrics improved the AUC to 0.79.

The structural design of the molecule allows flexible rotation and photo-induced cis-trans isomerization both in the solid state as well as in solution. These combined attributes of TPSI I are responsible for the ultrasensitive viscosity response of the new material, which was verified through the Förster-Hoffmann equation. According to this equation, the derived 'x' value is 1.02 (x is related to the sensitivity) which is the highest among the contemporary reports for RBFs. The facts were evidenced both by experimental as well as theoretical data.

We use four sets of highly accurate time-resolved X-ray magnetic circular dichroism data to construct four correlation diagrams for iron and cobalt. To our surprise, a pattern emerges. The trace on the correlation diagram for iron is an arc, and at the end of demagnetization, it has a pronounced cusp. The correlation diagram for cobalt is different and appears more linear but with kinks. We carry out first-principles calculations with two different methods: time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) and time-dependent Liouville density functional theory. These two methods agree that the experimental findings for both Fe and Co are not due to experimental errors. It is the spin-orbit coupling that correlates the spin dynamics to the orbital dynamics. Microscopically, Fe and Co have different orbital occupations, which leads to distinctive correlation diagrams.

Blended care psychotherapy combining provider-led care with digital tools can help alleviate this toll. This study describes the development of digital activities designed to teach cognitive-behavioral skills for coping with COVID-19 distress, and evaluates initial acceptability and feasibility data. Materials and Methods: Using a pragmatic retrospective cohort design, data from 664 U.S.-based individuals enrolled in blended care psychotherapy were analyzed. Descriptive analyses summarized acceptability for the digital activities. Ordinal logistic regression analyses were conducted on a subsample (n = 162) to explore the association between clients' attitudes toward the digital lesson and reported practice of skills in the exercise. Results: The majority of clients completed the assigned digital lesson and exercise. Clients reported finding the lesson valuable and relevant for coping with COVID-19 distress, and they intended to apply the skills to their lives. Higher agreement with these attitude questions was associated with a significantly greater number of skills practiced on the digital exercise. Discussion: Clients who were assigned a cognitive-behaviorally oriented digital lesson and/or exercise within a blended care model largely engaged with the materials and found them valuable.

This review examines apps designed for suicide prevention, with a specific focus on user engagement. Objective: This study aims to update the literature and broadly evaluate the landscape of mobile health apps for suicide prevention; examine apps with key features and primary approaches to suicide prevention; and systematically evaluate the engagement, functionality, aesthetics, and information of the apps. Methods: All apps related to suicidal thoughts and behaviors were identified in the Google Play and iOS app stores and were systematically reviewed for their content and quality. The mobile app rating scale (MARS) was used to evaluate app usability and engagement. Results: Of the 66 apps identified, 42 (64%) were specifically designed for people with suicidal ideation, and 59 (89%) had at least one best practice feature for suicide risk reduction. The mean overall MARS score of all apps was 3.5 (range 2.1-4.5), with 83% (55/66) of apps having a minimum acceptability score of 3.

Males of the freshwater fish Poecilia parae occur as one of five discrete morphs, all of which shoal together in natural populations where morph frequency has been stable for over 50 years. Each morph uses a different complex reproductive strategy and morphs differ dramatically in colour, body size and mating behaviour. Morph phenotype is passed perfectly from father to son, indicating there are five Y haplotypes segregating in the species, which encode the complex male morph characteristics. Here, we examine Y diversity in natural populations of P. parae. Using linked-read sequencing on multiple P. parae females and males of all five morphs, we find that the genetic architecture of the male morphs evolved on the Y chromosome after recombination suppression had occurred with the X. Comparing Y chromosomes between each of the morphs, we show that, although the Ys of the three minor morphs that differ in colour are highly similar, there are substantial amounts of unique genetic material and divergence between the Ys of the three major morphs that differ in reproductive strategy, body size and mating behaviour. Altogether, our results suggest that the Y chromosome is able to overcome the constraints of recombination loss to generate extreme diversity, resulting in five discrete Y chromosomes that control complex reproductive strategies.",,10.1038/s41559-021-01452-w,2397334X,939,H2020 European Research Council,201809BPF-411714-64911,85105291556 (Scopus),,7,948,2021-07-01,33958755.0,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-021-01452-w,Nature Ecology and Evolution,5

Investigations into the properties of the three proteins can be aided by larger-scale recombinant expression to produce adequate amounts. In the current study, a variety of NLRP3 inflammasome proteins were expressed in the ExpiCHO-S mammalian cell system with a particular focus on ASC. ASC fusion proteins with glutathione-S transferase, maltose-binding protein, and SUMO increased solubility and aided in determining the stability and oligomerization propensity of individual ASC domains and full-length ASC.

Provided they are sufficiently soluble in water, their hydrophobic structures have the potential for many biological and industrial applications in the detection and characterization of lipophilic structures. To that end, the emission behaviors of previously synthesized 2,7- bis[alkynyl(biphenyl)]-9,9-diphenylsilafluorene (1), 2,7- bis[alkynyl(methoxynaphthyl)]-9,9-diphenylgermafluorene (2), 2,7- bis[alkynyl(p-tolyl)]-9,9-diphenylsilafluorene (3), and 2,7- bis[alkynyl(m-fluorophenyl)]-9,9-diphenylsilafluorene (4) were characterized in aqueous solution and in the presence of various surfactants. Despite a high degree of hydrophobicity, all of these metallafluorenes (MFs) are soluble in aqueous solution at low micromolar concentrations and luminesce in a common aqueous buffer. Further, the 2,7 substituent makes the emission behavior tunable (up to 30 nm). Fold emission enhancements in the presence of various surfactants are highest toward Triton X-100 and CTAB (ranging from 5 to 25 fold) and are lowest for the anionic surfactants SDS and SDBS. These enhancements are competitive with existing probes of surfactants. Quantum yields in buffer range from 0.11 to 0.34, competitive with many common fluorophores in biological use. Strikingly, MF quantum yields in the presence of TX-100 and CTAB approach 100 % quantum efficiency. MF anisotropies are dramatically increased only in the presence of TX-100, CTAB, and CHAPS. Coupled with the above data, this suggests that MFs associate with neutral and charged surfactant aggregates. Interactions with the anionic surfactants are weaker and/or leave MFs solvent exposed. These properties make metallafluorenes competitive probes for surfactants and their properties and behaviors, and thus could also have important biological applications.",,10.1007/s10895-021-02730-3,15734994,961,National Science Foundation,CHE-1362431,85103589622 (Scopus),10530509,4,969,2021-07-01,33821437.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10895-021-02730-3,Journal of Fluorescence,31
Invasion success and impacts depend on different characteristics in non-native plants,OA,Gold OA,-,-,Green Final OA,-,https://doi.org/10.1111/ddi.13267,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85103535903,"biological traits, introduction history, invasion impacts, invasive plants, invasiveness, naturalized plants, species comparisons","Aim: Biological invasions threaten biodiversity globally. Large-scale studies of non-native plant species invasiveness typically focus on identifying ecological differences between naturalized and invasive species that account for their spread from sites of initial establishment (i.e., invasion success). However, invasive species differ widely in the magnitude of their impacts, suggesting the characteristics that favour invasion success might not necessarily predict the consequences of that invasion. Here we test whether those factors that increase the probability of plant species invasion also explain the severity of impacts. Location: China. Methods: We compiled a database of the invasiveness, biogeographic origins, life history traits, and introduction history for 538 non-native plants in China and modelled differences in (a) naturalized and invasive species; (b) the spatial extent of invasion; and, (c) the severity of invasion impacts among successful invaders. Results: Invasion success and the spatial extent of invasion shared similar influencing factors. However, these clearly differed from the predictors of severe invasion impacts. Unintentionally introduced non-native plants with shorter life cycles and longer residence times were more likely to become invasive and to invade a larger area, while taller plants introduced from the Americas tended to have more severe impacts on the native ecosystems of China. Main Conclusions: These results illustrate the different roles of introduction history, biogeographical origin and biological traits in determining the invasion success and spatial extent of invasion versus the severity of invasive species impacts. We suggest that factors associated with evolutionary adaptation and population expansion might determine invasion success and extent, while traits related to the relative competitive ability of invasive species determine the severity of impacts. Identifying specific characteristics of species that distinguish among successful invaders most likely to result in more severe impacts could help with planning more effective interventions.",,10.1111/ddi.13267,14724642,1194,National Natural Science Foundation of China,2020A1515010391,85103535903 (Scopus),13669516,7,1207,2021-07-01,,https://doi.org/10.1111/ddi.13267,Diversity and Distributions,27

However, the clinical, virological and neurocognitive effects of syphilis during acute HIV-1 (AHI) remain unknown. Methods: Pre-antiretroviral therapy laboratory outcomes and neurocognitive performance in a four-test battery in the SEARCH10/RV254 AHI cohort were compared according to syphilis status, determined by serum Treponema pallidum haemagglutination (TPHA), Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) and syphilis treatment history.

In many situations it is necessary to separate these signals or time series to a finite number of mono-components to represent the intrinsic modes and underlying dynamics implicated in the source signals. Recently the synchrosqueezed transform (SST) was developed as an empirical mode decomposition (EMD)-like tool to enhance the time-frequency resolution and energy concentration of a multi-component non-stationary signal and provides more accurate component recovery. To recover individual components, the SST method consists of two steps. First the instantaneous frequency (IF) of a component is estimated from the SST plane. Secondly, after IF is recovered, the associated component is computed by a definite integral along the estimated IF curve on the SST plane. The reconstruction accuracy for a component depends heavily on the accuracy of the IFs estimation carried out in the first step. More recently, a direct method of the time-frequency approach, called signal separation operation (SSO), was introduced for multi-component signal separation. While both SST and SSO are mathematically rigorous on IF estimation, SSO avoids the second step of the two-step SST method in component recovery (mode retrieval). The SSO method is based on some variant of the short-time Fourier transform. In the present paper, we propose a direct method of signal separation based on the adaptive continuous wavelet-like transform (CWLT) by introducing two models of the adaptive CWLT-based approach for signal separation: the sinusoidal signal-based model and the linear chirp-based model, which are derived respectively from sinusoidal signal approximation and the linear chirp approximation at any time instant. A more accurate component recovery formula is derived from linear chirp local approximation. We present the theoretical analysis of our approach.

Unlike the vehicles in classical arc routing problems, a drone can enter a line through any of its points, service a portion of that line, exit through another of its points, then travel directly to any point on another line, and so on. Moreover, since the range of the drones is restricted, the length of each route is limited by a maximum distance. Some applications for drone arc routing problems include inspection of pipelines, railway or power transmission lines and traffic monitoring. To deal with this problem, LC K-DRPP instances are digitized by approximating each line by a polygonal chain with a finite number of points and allowing drones to enter and exit each line only at these points. In this way we obtain an instance of the Length Constrained K-vehicles Rural Postman Problem (LC K-RPP). If the number of points used to discretize the lines is large, the LC K-RPP instance can be extremely large and, hence, very difficult to solve optimally. Even heuristic algorithms can fail in providing feasible solutions in reasonable computing times. An alternative is to generate smaller LC K-RPP instances by approximating each line with few but “significant” segments. We present a formulation and some valid inequalities for the LC K-RPP. Based on this, we have designed and implemented a branch-and-cut algorithm for its solution. Moreover, in order to be capable of providing good solutions for large LC K-RPP instances, we propose a matheuristic algorithm that begins by finding good solutions for the LC K-RPP instance obtained by approximating each line by a single segment. Then, to find better solutions, some promising intermediate points are sequentially incorporated. Extensive computational experiments to assess the performance of both algorithms are performed on several sets of instances from the literature.",,10.1016/j.ejor.2020.10.035,,60,"Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades",PGC2018-099428-B-I00,85096173778 (Scopus),03772217,1,72,2021-07-01,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2020.10.035,European Journal of Operational Research,292

Yet, gaps remain in our understanding of services needed and the best approaches to improve outcomes. Using cross-sectional electronic survey data from 107 service providers to human trafficking victims across Missouri, this study examines (1) victims’ service needs, (2) agencies’ ability to provide services, (3) victim sub-populations that agencies are able to serve, and (4) the rural/urban availability of anti-trafficking services. Findings: Service providers, including social workers, counselors, law enforcement, and medical professionals reported that the most needed services for victims included case management, counseling, crisis services, shelter, and medical assistance. However, out of 15 possible victim services, only two were provided in-house by the majority of agencies. Additionally, respondents identified populations they were frequently unable to serve including incarcerated victims, tribal victims of violence, and refugees and immigrants. Urban counties were served by a significantly higher mean number of respondents compared to rural counties. Applications: Findings raise concerns that some of the most critical services needed for best practice response may not be easily accessible for victims, particularly in rural regions. In addition, many providers are tasked with addressing multiple service needs with limited resources. Efforts to increase cross-discipline training, interdisciplinary collaboration, and funding for basic services are needed to ensure adequate and accessible services for survivors.

Gun attitudes are a potential risk factor for gun violence; however, factors related to gun attitudes have not been identified. Mental illness such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is commonly discussed as a key factor in gun violence, despite research lacking in this area, and it is unknown whether symptoms of PTSD and probable PTSD are associated with more positive attitudes toward guns. The aim of the current study was to investigate the relations between PTSD symptoms and gun attitudes among 265 undergraduate students who experienced at least one interpersonal traumatic event (Mage = 24.69 years, SD = 7.15 years, 75.6% female, 61.1% White). Path analysis revealed that individuals with PTSD symptoms above clinical cutoff were not more likely to have more positive gun attitudes. However, the PTSD symptom clusters evinced distinct relations with gun attitudes. Intrusion and avoidance symptoms were related to gun beliefs regarding protection, with intrusion symptoms being linked to a stronger belief that guns provide protection from crime and victimization (β =.23), whereas avoidance symptoms were inversely associated with this belief (β = −.22). Interestingly, neither trauma related in feelings and thoughts nor arousal and reactivity corresponded with gun attitudes.

While both dimensions demonstrate significant positive relationships with symptoms of PTSD, the relationship between the two within the context of the disorder has yet to be explored. Consistent with prior research in the social anxiety literature, the present study seeks to examine a model of mediation by which rumination accounts for the significant relationship between NA and PTSD symptoms. Participants included 65 female interpersonal trauma survivors diagnosed with PTSD using structured, clinician-administered interviews. Both NA and rumination were observed as significant predictors of PTSD symptoms, and the variables were significantly associated with each other. However, NA was no longer a significant predictor of PTSD symptoms when rumination was entered into the mediation model, suggesting full mediation of the relationship by rumination. Results from the current study suggest a complex relationship between NA and rumination in interpersonal trauma survivors with PTSD, such that a ruminative cognitive coping style may either mitigate or exacerbate PTSD symptoms in the presence of sustained negative emotion. The current findings provide support for a cognitive model of PTSD, within which PTSD symptoms are influenced via negative, ruminative cognitions. Primary implications of these results include (a) the consideration of assessment of rumination in interpersonal trauma survivors with PTSD in clinical settings; (b) the selection of treatment that may address a ruminative cognitive style in this population, given the mediation between subjective distress and PTSD symptoms by rumination; and (c) the necessity for the validation of this mediation model within other traumatized populations.",,10.1177/0886260518818434,15526518,6418,,,85060041566 (Scopus),08862605,13-14,6439,2021-07-01,30556467.0,https://doi.org/10.1177/0886260518818434,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,36

Seed-based voxelwise rsFC analyses for left and right nucleus accumbens (NAcc) seed regions of interest were performed. Voxelwise regression analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between anhedonia severity and rsFC of left and right NAcc. Results indicated that greater anhedonia severity was associated with reduced rsFC between the left NAcc and a cluster in the left caudate extending to the thalamus.

Ferrocenium cations have been employed as catalysts in a number of organic transformations, and we investigated the stability of a number of ferrocenium salts in solution. The observed rate decomposition constants for [Fc]Cl, [Fc]PF 6, [Fc]BF 4, [Fc]CSA [Fc = ferrocenium, CSA = camphor-10-sulfonate (β)], [AcFc]SbF 6, (AcFc = acetylated ferrocene), and [FcB(OH) 2]SbF 6[FcB(OH) 2= ferrocenylboronic acid] were determined in CH 2Cl 2solution by time-resolved UV-vis spectroscopy. The rate decomposition constants depended on the nature of the counterion, with [Fc]Cl being the most stable complex in solution. The decomposition rate constants dropped by roughly an order of magnitude in most cases when the experiments were performed in nitrogenated solvent, demonstrating that the decomposition is mainly an oxidative process. The cosolvent HFIP (1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoropropan-2-ol) slowed the decomposition of the ferrocenium cations as well. Many catalytic or stoichiometric reactions of ferrocenium cations are performed with alcohols; we determined that hexan-1-ol is decomposed over the course of 16 hours, but not oxidized in the presence of a ferrocenium cation. Finally, the different ferrocenium cations were employed in a test reaction to determine catalytic activity. The nucleophilic substitution of hydroxyl groups in a tertiary propargylic alcohol by an alcohol is catalyzed by all complexes, and, again, a counterion dependency of the catalytic activity was observed. Also, HFIP increases the catalytic activity of the ferrocenium cations. The research has importance in the development of ferrocenium-based catalyst systems, because changes in the counterion as well as the architecture of the ferrocenium cation have an influence on stability and catalytic activity.",,10.1055/s-0040-1705992,1437210X,2007,National Science Foundation,CHE-9974801,85098134317 (Scopus),00397881,11,2014,2021-06-02,,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1705992,Synthesis (Germany),53

Further, there was a lack of application of best practice principles for most of the injury types. For athletes who received medical care, the results show inconsistencies and inadequacies from the acute stage of the injury to return-to-sports participation.

Acquisition of new traits can be achieved through horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Here, we investigate drivers that promote or deter the maintenance of HGT-driven degeneracy, occurring when processes accomplish identical functions through nonidentical components. Subsequent evolution can optimize newly acquired functions; for example, beneficial alleles identified in an engineered Methylorubrum extorquens strain allowed it to utilize a ""Foreign"" formaldehyde oxidation pathway substituted for its Native pathway for methylotrophic growth. We examined the fitness consequences of interactions between these alleles when they were combined with the Native pathway or both (Dual) pathways. Unlike the Foreign pathway context where they evolved, these alleles were often neutral or deleterious when moved into these alternative genetic backgrounds. However, there were instances where combinations of multiple alleles resulted in higher fitness outcomes than individual allelic substitutions could provide. Importantly, the genetic context accompanying these allelic substitutions significantly altered the fitness landscape, shifting local fitness peaks and restricting the set of accessible evolutionary trajectories. These findings highlight how genetic context can negatively impact the probability of maintaining native and HGT-introduced functions together, making it difficult for degeneracy to evolve. However, in cases where the cost of maintaining degeneracy was mitigated by adding evolved alleles impacting the function of these pathways, we observed rare opportunities for pathway coevolution to occur.

We found significant differences among tree species in the proportion of stem length bored by beetles, the number of cavities per stem length, average entrance-hole size, and the distribution of cavity volumes. The likelihood that a cavity was occupied was greater for cavities with larger entrance-hole sizes and larger volumes. In particular, there was a strong positive correlation between mean head diameters of ant species and the mean entrance-hole diameter of the cavities occupied by those ant species.

Recently, the synchrosqueezed wavelet transform (SST) and its variants have been developed to estimate instantaneous frequencies and separate the components of non-stationary multicomponent signals. The short-time Fourier transform-based SST (FSST for short) reassigns the frequency variable to sharpen the time-frequency representation and to separate the components of a multicomponent non-stationary signal. However FSST works well only with multicomponent signals having slowly changing frequencies. To deal with multicomponent signals having fast-changing frequencies, the second-order FSST (FSST2 for short) was proposed. The key point for FSST2 is to construct a phase transformation of a signal which is the instantaneous frequency when the signal is a linear chirp. In this paper we consider a phase transformation for FSST2 which has a simple expression than that used in the literature.

To elucidate the mechanism by which NPCs mediate cellular functions, here we show that NPC4 is S-acylated at the C terminus and that acylation determines its plasma membrane (PM) association and function. The acylation of NPC4 was detected using NPC4 isolated from Arabidopsis and reconstituted in vitro. The C-terminal Cys-533 was identified as the S-acylation residue, and the mutation of Cys-533 to Ala-533 in NPC4 (NPC4C533A) led to the loss of S-acylation and membrane association of NPC4. The knockout of NPC4 impeded the phosphate deficiency-induced decrease of the phosphosphingolipid glycosyl inositol phosphoryl ceramide (GIPC), but introducing NPC4C533A to npc4-1 failed to complement this defect, thereby supporting the hypothesis that the non-acylated NPC4C533A fails to hydrolyze GIPC during phosphate deprivation. Moreover, NPC4C533A failed to complement the primary root growth in npc4-1 under stress. In addition, NPC4 in Brassica napus was S-acylated and mutation of the S-acylating cysteine residue of BnaC01.NPC4 led to the loss of S-acylation and its membrane association.

While the characterization of PA-DNA behavior has focused principally on hairpin PAs 6–8 rings in size, there is increasing evidence that their behavior does not necessarily reflect the complexities that are emerging from studies of larger hairpin PAs, particularly concerning sequence mismatch tolerance and observed but unaddressed high PA-target site binding stoichiometries. To explore these complexities in more detail, kinetics studies of binding a large anti-HPV hairpin polyamide to an isolated DNA recognition site are described. Using a fluorescence assay, two distinct binding phases are observed for the first time in hairpin PA literature. PA14 concentration dependence analysis indicates that the faster binding event is diffusion-controlled; the apparent, second event is significantly slower (350–1500 fold). Both association phases are sampled in 1:1 complexes, consistent with cooperative binding of two PA molecules even under this condition. Fitting of the slow phase to a biexponential model yields two λon,app that differ by 4-5-fold, which is consistent with the high mismatch tolerance and binding site stoichiometry previously observed. A/T patterns in the recognition sequence do not affect these decay constants significantly.

These notable trends in industrial development accompany incremental steps upward in the level of education productivity. As education grows, human capital becomes relatively abundant and industries react by deepening their investment in human capital. Industries that use human capital relatively more intensively experience relatively lower prices and higher output. New industries are assumed to emerge in step with education productivity. Each new industry is assumed to have a relatively higher human capital factor share. As human capital deepening occurs, labor shifts toward the new industry and away from traditional industry. I delineate these features by extending a well-known model of endogenous economic growth through human capital investment. The extension disaggregates output into separate industries with different shares of the human capital factor. This enables trademark features of industrial development. The model explains rising education levels, growth, and labor reallocation using a minimally complex approach that jointly explains stylized facts through human capital deepening within each industry.",105470,10.1016/j.econmod.2021.02.011,,,University of Missouri,,85103247372 (Scopus),02649993,,,2021-06-01,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.econmod.2021.02.011,Economic Modelling,99

This is concerning because traditional Western masculine norms include restricted emotionality, and conformity to these norms relates to emotion dysregulation. Fathers' views on masculinity are likely to impact their parenting attitudes and behavior and therefore relate to their socialization of children's emotion regulation.

However, the role of comorbid major depressive disorder (MDD) is unknown. Given blunted physiological arousal in MDD, the SAD only group (SAD) may use more PS words than the comorbid (COM) group with SAD and MDD when discussing anxious memories. Due to more severe symptomology, however, the COM group may use more PS words than the SAD group. We examined these competing hypotheses. Methods: The SAD (n = 30), COM (n = 19), and control (CTL; n = 30) groups recalled their happiest, saddest, and most anxious events. The proportion of PS words was examined. Results: The SAD group used significantly more PS words than the CTL group, whose PS words did not differ significantly from the COM group; the SAD group used marginally more PS words than the COM group. Anxious memories contained significantly more PS words than happiest and saddest memories. Happiest and saddest memories did not significantly differ in PS words. Limitations: The PS words list was created by the authors, and a LIWC dictionary was not used. Conclusions: Blunted physiological arousal in MDD may have contributed to lower PS word usage in the COM group than the SAD group.

Variability in resting-state networks (RSNs), patterns of intrinsic functional connectivity across the brain, has previously been linked to PTSD, and may thus be informative of PTSD susceptibility. The present data are part of an initial analysis from the AURORA study, a longitudinal, multisite study of adverse neuropsychiatric sequalae. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 109 recently (i.e., ~2 weeks) traumatized individuals were collected and PTSD and depression symptoms were assessed at 3 months post trauma. We assessed commonly reported RSNs including the default mode network (DMN), central executive network (CEN), and salience network (SN). We also identified a proposed arousal network (AN) composed of a priori brain regions important for PTSD: the amygdala, hippocampus, mamillary bodies, midbrain, and pons. Primary analyses assessed whether variability in functional connectivity at the 2-week imaging timepoint predicted 3-month PTSD symptom severity. Left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) to AN connectivity at 2 weeks post trauma was negatively related to 3-month PTSD symptoms. Further, right inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) to DMN connectivity was positively related to 3-month PTSD symptoms. Both DLPFC-AN and ITG-DMN connectivity also predicted depression symptoms at 3 months. Our results suggest that, following trauma exposure, acutely assessed variability in RSN connectivity was associated with PTSD symptom severity approximately two and a half months later. However, these patterns may reflect general susceptibility to posttraumatic dysfunction as the imaging patterns were not linked to specific disorder symptoms, at least in the subacute/early chronic phase. The present data suggest that assessment of RSNs in the early aftermath of trauma may be informative of susceptibility to posttraumatic dysfunction, with future work needed to understand neural markers of long-term (e.g., 12 months post trauma) dysfunction. Furthermore, these findings are consistent with neural models suggesting that decreased top-down cortico-limbic regulation and increased network-mediated fear generalization may contribute to ongoing dysfunction in the aftermath of trauma.",,10.1038/s41386-020-00946-8,1740634X,1263,National Institutes of Health,JAX- ASCENT,85099832412 (Scopus),0893133X,7,1271,2021-06-01,33479509.0,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41386-020-00946-8,Neuropsychopharmacology,46

Additionally, this research evaluated the relationships between these self-reported symptoms and objective performance on measures of working memory. Design: This experimental study utilized a mixed factorial design with one between-subjects factor (whether participants were unmedicated or medicated at the time they completed their assessment) and one within-subjects factor (whether participants reported their on-medication or off-medication symptoms when describing their ADHD subjective symptomatology). Methods: Forty-five young adults with ADHD (ages 18–23) completed a brief neuropsychological evaluation and several self-report questionnaires. Results: Although being medicated or unmedicated while completing the questionnaires did not directly affect self-reported symptoms or their accuracy, questionnaire wording exerted a statistically significant effect on subjective symptomatology; participants described themselves as substantially more symptomatic at times when they are off than at times when they are on their medications. More importantly, their general self-perceptions (symptoms when medication state was not specified) of their Inattention/Memory Problems and their Hyperactivity/Restlessness aligned with their descriptions of their off-medication symptoms, whereas their general self-perceptions of their Impulsivity/Emotional Lability and Problems with Self-Concept related to both their self-reported off-medication and on-medication symptoms. Conclusions: These results highlight the necessity of specifying medication state when asking patients to report their current symptomatology. Failing to do so risks an over-reporting of symptoms from patients who are typically on medications as they may describe the extent of their unmedicated, rather than medicated, symptomatology. Practitioner points: Being medicated or unmedicated while completing questionnaires about subjective symptomatology did not directly affect self-reported symptoms of young adults with ADHD or the accuracy of these self-reports. When medication state was not specified on a questionnaire, young adults with ADHD reported symptoms similar to those they experience when they are not medicated. These results highlight the importance of specifying medication state when asking young adults with ADHD to report their current symptomatology. Failing to do so risks an over-reporting of symptoms from patients who are typically on medications. These findings open the door for further research with larger and more diverse and representative samples of adults with ADHD to evaluate the accuracy of their subjective symptomatology relative to their objective abilities.

It shows how an increase in the tax rate causes the tax elasticity and welfare cost to increase in magnitude by more than with zero evasion. Keeping constant the ratio of income tax revenue to output, as shown to be consistent with certain US evidence, a rising productivity of the goods sector induces less evasion and thereby allows tax rate reduction. The paper derives conditions for a stable share of income tax revenue in output with dependence upon the tax elasticity of reporting income. Examples are provided with less and more productive economies in terms of the tax elasticity of reported income, the welfare cost of taxation and the tax revenue as a percent of output, with sensitivity analysis with respect to leisure preference and goods productivity. Discussion focuses on how the tax evasion analysis may help explain such fiscal tax policy as the postwar US income tax rate reductions along with discussion of government fiscal multipliers.

Considerable evidence has demonstrated the significant racial disparities that exist with respect to PTE exposure, indicating that Black youth are particularly burdened by these harmful experiences. Racism may serve a unique role in explaining why Black youth are disproportionately exposed to PTEs, and why mental health disparities are more likely to occur following such experiences. Despite clear evidence acknowledging racism as a major life stressor for Black youth, theoretical models of early childhood adversity have largely neglected the multifaceted influence of racism on mental health outcomes. Inspired by bourgeoning literature highlighting the potentially traumatic nature of racism-related experiences for Black youth, we present a culturally-informed Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) model, or “C-ACE”, to understand the pervasive and deleterious mental health impact of racism on Black youth. This model extends the ACE framework by noting the significance of racism as an ACE exposure risk factor, a distinct ACE category, and a determinant of post-ACE mental health outcomes among Black youth. The model acknowledges and supports the advancement of ACEs research that takes a culturally informed approach to understanding the intergenerational and multilevel impact of racism on the mental health of Black youth.

We employ face-centered cubic (fcc) Ni as an example and use an extremely dense k mesh to map out spin changes for every band close to the Fermi level along all the high symmetry lines. To our surprise, spin angular momentum at some special k points abruptly changes from ± /2 to /2 simply by moving from one crystal momentum point to the next. This explains why intraband transitions, which the spin superdiffusion model is based upon, can induce a sharp spin moment reduction, and why electric current can change spin orientation in spintronics. These special k points, which are called spin Berry points [M. V. Berry, Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A 393 (1984) 45], are not random and appear when several bands are close to each other, so the Berry potential of spin majority states is different from that of spin minority states. Although within a single band, spin Berry points jump, when we group several neighboring bands together, they form distinctive smooth spin Berry lines. It is the band structure that disrupts those lines. Spin Berry points are crucial to laser-induced ultrafast demagnetization and spintronics.",2150215,10.1142/S0217984921502158,,,U.S. Department of Energy,DE-FG02-06ER46304,85102952847 (Scopus),02179849,13,,2021-05-10,,https://doi.org/10.1142/S0217984921502158,Modern Physics Letters B,35

This is especially true for complex clinical conditions such as HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorders (HAND). The aim of this study was to identify novel and modifiable factors that have potential to improve diagnostic accuracy of ADL risk, with the long-term goal of guiding future interventions to minimize ADL disruption. Methods: study participants included 79 people with HIV (PWH; mean age = 63; range = 55–80) enrolled in neuroHIV studies at University California San Francisco (UCSF) between 2016 and 2019. All participants were virally suppressed and exhibited objective evidence of neurocognitive impairment. ADL status was defined as either normative (n = 39) or at risk (n = 40) based on a task-based protocol. Gradient boosted multivariate regression (GBM) was employed to identify the combination of variables that differentiated ADL subgroup classification. Predictor variables included demographic factors, HIV disease severity indices, brain white matter integrity quantified using diffusion tensor imaging, cognitive test performance, and health co-morbidities. Model performance was examined using average Area Under the Curve (AUC) with repeated five-fold cross validation. Findings: the univariate GBM yielded an average AUC of 83% using Wide Range Achievement test 4 (WRAT-4) reading score, self-reported thought confusion and difficulty reading, radial diffusivity (RD) in the left external capsule, fractional anisotropy (FA) in the left cingulate gyrus, and Stroop performance. The model allowing for two-way interactions modestly improved classification performance (AUC of 88%) and revealed synergies between race, reading ability, cognitive performance, and neuroimaging metrics in the genu and uncinate fasciculus. Conversion of Neuropsychological Assessment Battery Daily Living Module (NAB-DLM) performance from raw scores into T scores amplified differences between White and non-White study participants. Interpretation: demographic and sociocultural factors are critical determinants of ADL risk status among older PWH who meet diagnostic criteria for neurocognitive impairment. Task-based ADL assessment that relies heavily on reading proficiency may artificially inflate the frequency/severity of ADL impairment among diverse clinical populations. Culturally relevant measures of ADL status are needed for individuals with acquired neurocognitive disorders, including HAND.",100845,10.1016/j.eclinm.2021.100845,25895370,,National Institute of Mental Health,,85105292711 (Scopus),,,,2021-05-01,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2021.100845,EClinicalMedicine,35

Little is known about their effect on quality of life and other patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in adults with CHD. Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of atrial arrhythmias on PROs in adults with CHD and explore geographic variations. Methods: Associations between atrial arrhythmias and PROs were assessed in a cross-sectional study of adults with CHD from 15 countries spanning 5 continents. A propensity-based matching weight analysis was performed to compare quality of life, perceived health status, psychological distress, sense of coherence, and illness perception in patients with and those without atrial arrhythmias. Results: A total of 4028 adults with CHD were enrolled, 707 (17.6%) of whom had atrial arrhythmias. After applying matching weights, patients with and those without atrial arrhythmias were comparable with regard to age (mean 40.1 vs 40.2 years), demographic variables (52.5% vs 52.2% women), and complexity of CHD (15.9% simple, 44.8% moderate, and 39.2% complex in both groups). Patients with atrial arrhythmias had significantly worse PRO scores with respect to quality of life, perceived health status, psychological distress (ie, depression), and illness perception. A summary score that combines all PRO measures was significantly lower in patients with atrial arrhythmias (–3.3%; P = .0006). Differences in PROs were consistent across geographic regions.

They underwent a four-test neuropsychological battery that measured fine motor speed and dexterity, psychomotor speed, and executive functioning at baseline (pre-ART AHI), weeks 12, 24 and 96, and annually thereafter through week 288. Performances were standardized to calculate an overall (NPZ-4) score and frequencies of impaired cognitive performance (≤-1 SD on at least two tests, or ≤-2 SD on at least one test).

However, few studies investigate whether recognition of distress calls involves learning or acoustic similarity to familiar calls. This study assesses the importance of these two factors as well as phylogenetic relatedness in distress call recognition by tropical rainforest birds. We measured the avian community responses to familiar and unfamiliar distress calls in a lowland tropical rainforest in Costa Rica using playbacks of a sympatric species, the orange-billed sparrow, Arremon aurantiirostris, and a closely related allopatric species, the white-eared ground-sparrow, Melozone leucotis. In addition, to test whether recognition is driven by phylogenetic relatedness to the call sender, we compared the phylogenetic distance of approaching individuals to A. aurantiirostris when using different playback stimuli. We found that individuals called back to sympatric and allopatric calls within similar amounts of time, supporting the role of acoustic similarity in distress call recognition. We also found that individuals approached faster and spent more time inside the observation zone for sympatric distress calls than for allopatric distress calls, and both responses were stronger than the response to white noise (control), which supports the roles of acoustic similarity and learning in distress call recognition. Sympatric distress calls elicited approaching reactions from species that were more closely related to the sympatric species than did white noise, which suggests that phylogenetically related species are more likely to identify and respond to the sympatric distress signaller, while white noise elicited responses from a random subset of species that were on average more distantly related to the sympatric signaller. We conclude that learning, acoustic similarity and phylogenetic relatedness play important roles in the response to distress calls.",,10.1016/j.anbehav.2021.02.015,,111,Whitney R.

We find that each of the alpine floras represents an assemblage of more closely related species than their respective regional floras. The degree of phylogenetic clustering of species in alpine floras in tropical mountains exceeds that in temperate mountains. However, in relation to the global flora, temperate alpine floras are phylogenetically closely related subsets of floras that colonized cold temperate areas during interglacial periods.

Grandmothers within African American families, historically, have played a vital role in the transmission of culture. Understanding intergenerational perspectives within African American families related to infant feeding and scholarship about breastfeeding is critical, given the breastfeeding patterns among African American women. Research aim: To describe intergenerational perspectives within African American families, where the mother has successfully breastfed. Methods: A prospective, cross-sectional, qualitative design using semi-structured interviews was used. African American nursing mothers and maternal grandmothers (N = 14) residing in the Metro–St. Louis area, who reflected economic and educational diversity, were recruited. Inductive and iterative data analysis, framed by Black Feminist Theory allowed for emerging patterns reflecting the participants’ voices. Results: Three of the six (50%) grandmother participants had breastfed. The majority of the mother participants were married (n = 5; 62.5%) and had a college degree (n = 4; 50.0%) or a high school diploma (n = 1; 12.5%); and four (50.0%) had received the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). Three patterns emerged: (a) intergenerational connections; (b) changes in breastfeeding experiences over time; and (c) going with the flow (referring to the choice to work within the constraints of one’s circumstances). Grandmothers supported mothers’ breastfeeding decisions; grandmothers who had breastfed benefited from the updated information the mothers provided; and grandmothers who did not breastfeed acquired new breastfeeding knowledge, which informed the ways they supported the mothers.

Here, we conduct the first systematic study of nest-entrance modification in an arboreal ant community. Using field experiments deployed across a number of tree species, we show that 14% of 2631 experimental cavities were modified by either enlargement, or reducing entrance size by construction. Entrance modifications, which were made by a majority (18/29 species) of the species that occupied experimental nests, used a variety of construction techniques and materials. Combined, these modifications were context-dependent with respect to available entrance sizes: Enlargement was more common when the diversity of available entrance sizes was limited, whereas reduction was more prevalent when the diversity of entrance sizes was higher. Nevertheless, the context of tree species identity did not significantly influence the number of modified cavities or the construction materials.

These advancements create a huge demand for researchers to investigate new data compression techniques. Recent evidence from the literature shows that agent-based modeling is a promising direction to reduce the size of the data and change its original representation. In this article, the objective is to build an agent-based modeling simulation for chain coding and take advantage of it in data compression. Our agent-based model is inspired by the concept of defended territories of biological beavers. To this end, we use the pixel distribution in a bi-level image to construct a virtual environment of agents, add the beavers, and build territories around them. The main idea of defended beaver territories is to allow each beaver to maintain its area and protects it from intruders. To put it another way, defended territories allow beavers to work on different parts of an image while the algorithm tracks and records their movements, as well as manages disputes between them. Our research findings represent a further step towards employing the generated codes of movements in image processing operations other than coding and compression. Additionally, the experimental results showed that the current model was prosperous, and it could outperform many existing image compression techniques, including JBIG family methods.

Previous research also has demonstrated that individuals’ perceptions of how much they consented to sex—regardless of the level of coercion—are associated with negative cognitions. In this study, we aimed to explore the potential moderating role of perceived consent in the relationship between sexual coercion severity and negative cognitions following unwanted sex. Participants (N = 196) who had had a distressing unwanted sexual experience provided descriptions of their most distressing experience, rated their perceptions of how much they consented to this experience, and completed a questionnaire measuring the amount and content of negative cognitions they experienced following this experience. Two independent raters coded descriptions to determine coercion severity.

Recent evidence shows internet-delivered dialectic behaviour therapy (iDBT) skills training can reduce emotional dysregulation and pain intensity. However, further studies are needed to provide more definitive evidence regarding the efficacy of iDBT skills training in the chronic pain population. A single-case experimental design (SCED) with multiple baselines will be used to examine the efficacy of a 4-week iDBT-Pain skills training intervention (iDBT-Pain intervention) to reduce emotional dysregulation and pain intensity in individuals with chronic pain. The iDBT-Pain intervention encompasses two components: (1) iDBT-Pain skills training sessions (iDBT-Pain sessions) and (2) the iDBT-Pain skills training web application (iDBT-Pain app). Three individuals with chronic pain will be recruited and randomly allocated to different baseline phases (5, 9 or 12 days). Following the baseline phase, participants will receive six 60–90 min iDBT-Pain sessions approximately 4 or 5 days apart, delivered by a psychologist via Zoom. To reinforce learnings from the iDBT-Pain sessions, participants will have unlimited use of the iDBT-Pain app. A 7-day follow-up phase (maintenance) will follow the intervention, whereby the iDBT-Pain sessions cease but the iDBT-Pain app is accessible. Emotional regulation, as the primary outcome measure, will be assessed using the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale. Pain intensity, as the secondary outcome measure, will be assessed using a visual analogue scale. Generalisation measures will assess psychological state factors (depression, anxiety and coping behaviour), alongside sleep quality, well-being and harm avoidance. SCEDs are increasingly considered effective designs for internet-delivered psychological interventions because SCED enables the investigation of interindividual variability in a heterogeneous population such as chronic pain.

While the broad characteristics of longer (N ≥ 8 residue) doubly protonated peptides have been investigated, there is comparatively little data on shorter systems where charge repulsion should exhibit the greatest influence on the dissociation chemistry. To address this gap and further understand the chemistry underlying collisional-dissociation of doubly charged tryptic peptides, two series of analytes ([GxR+2H]2+ and [AxR+2H]2+, x = 2-5) were investigated experimentally and with theory. We find distinct differences in the preference of bond cleavage sites for these peptides as a function of size and to a lesser extent composition. Density functional calculations at two levels of theory predict that the threshold relative energies required for bond cleavages at the same site for peptides of different size are quite similar (for example, b2-yN-2). In isolation, this finding is inconsistent with experiment. However, the predicted extent of entropy change of these reactions is size dependent. Subsequent RRKM rate constant calculations provide a far clearer picture of the kinetics of the competing bond cleavage reactions enabling rationalization of experimental findings.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper presents a framework to manage humanitarian logistics effectively in disaster management through qualitative analysis. First, the author examines the challenges facing the humanitarian logistics and supply chain through the reviews of the literature on various disasters. Then, the author presented a framework based on the best practices and initiatives taken worldwide in the preparedness and response stage of the humanitarian supply chain to manage and reduce the aftermath of any disaster in context to India. Findings: A framework has been developed to manage humanitarian logistics in the disaster relief operation, which would improve the humanitarian supply chain in India and help to effectively manage natural disasters in the preparedness and response stage at the state and district levels. Research limitations/implications: The paper mainly emphasises on the preparedness and response stage of disaster supply chain management in Indian context. Practical implications: None of the disaster incidents can be stopped from taking place, but the impact can be minimised by proper preparedness and effective response during the operations of humanitarian logistics. With this hope, the framework has been developed, which if implemented would help to plan and manage any disaster incident in an effective manner, which ultimately would save millions of lives and cost in terms of infrastructure, property, assets etc. Originality/value: As natural disaster incidents are occurring frequently in Indian states, there is an urgent need for a framework to manage the logistics operations effectively and efficiently during any disaster relief operations.

These studies determined the abundances of several volatiles, including C2H2, C2H6, CH3OH, NH3, HCN, H2CO, and H2O. Long-slit spatial distributions of gas rotational temperature and column density are diagnostic for the presence of icy grains in the coma and understanding if different volatiles are associated with common or distinct outgassing sources. These spatial distributions suggest that C2H2, C2H6, and HCN have a common outgassing source, whereas H2O and CH3OH have additional, more extended sources. The synergy of these findings with observations by space missions (Rosetta and EPOXI) motivates continuing studies to address whether or not C2H6, C2H2, and HCN have a common source of release (plausibly associated with CO2) in a larger sample of comets and whether systematic differences exist in the release of these species compared to H2O and CH3OH. Abundances of volatiles are reported relative to H2O, as traditionally done, as well as C2H6. While not unique, the choice of C2H6 demonstrates the value of extending the chemical taxonomy of parent volatiles in comets toward additional compositional “baselines” and, importantly, closer integration between coma abundances and the underlying volatile associations as revealed by spatial distributions.

However, little is known about these membrane–cytoskeleton interfaces and related genes. Here, we report the roles of a major root phospholipase D (PLD), PLDα1, and its enzymatic product, phosphatidic acid (PA), in rhizobium–root interaction and nodulation. PLDα1 was activated and the PA content transiently increased in roots after rhizobial infection. Levels of PLDα1 transcript and PA, as well as actin and tubulin cytoskeleton-related gene expression, changed markedly during root–rhizobium interactions and nodule development. Pre-treatment of the roots of soybean seedlings with n-butanol suppressed the generation of PLD-derived PA, the expression of early nodulation genes and nodule numbers. Overexpression or knockdown of GmPLDα1 resulted in changes in PA levels, glycerolipid profiles, nodule numbers, actin cytoskeleton dynamics, early nodulation gene expression and hormone levels upon rhizobial infection compared with GUS roots. The transcript levels of cytoskeleton-related genes, such as GmACTIN, GmTUBULIN, actin capping protein 1 (GmCP1) and microtubule-associating protein (GmMAP1), were modified in GmPLDα1-altered hairy roots compared with those of GUS roots. Phosphatidic acid physically bound to GmCP1 and GmMAP1, which could be related to cytoskeletal changes in rhizobium-infected GmPLDα1 mutant roots.

Long-term N and S addition increased the diversity of root-associated pathogens, notably the abundance of Venturia macularis, which causes aspen leaf and shoot blight, in the forest floor. Nitrogen addition increased the abundance of several N-sensitive EMF taxa and of EMF related to organic-N uptake from the soil, but had little effect on the overall abundance and diversity of EMF. Nitrogen and S addition did not affect the abundance and diversity of DSEs, but N addition decreased the Shannon diversity and evenness of ERM communities in the mineral soil.

These seem to be compounded in those who suffer a brain injury as a result of trauma to the head, neck or body due to physical and/or sexual violence. However, our understanding of the neurobehavioral and neurobiological effects of head trauma in this population is limited due to factors including difficulty in accessing/recruiting participants, heterogeneity of samples, and premorbid and comorbid factors that impact outcomes.

Children and adolescents suffer from TBI at a higher rate than the general population, and specific developmental issues require a unique context since findings from adult research do not necessarily directly translate to children. Findings in pediatric cohorts tend to lag behind those in adult samples. This may be due, in part, both to the smaller number of investigators engaged in research with this population and may also be related to changes in safety laws and clinical practice that have altered length of hospital stays, treatment, and access to this population. The ENIGMA (Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis) Pediatric Moderate/Severe TBI (msTBI) group aims to advance research in this area through global collaborative meta-analysis of neuroimaging data.

For the bulk noise, we consider carbon-13 and nitrogen as impurities and employ the correlated-cluster expansion to calculate noise. Carbon-13 noise is a few orders of magnitude larger than nitrogen due to the higher impurity density in the typical NV center diamond system.

The study examined neurocognitive performance before and after 72 weeks of ART using repeated multivariate analyses and latent trajectory models. Methods: One hundred and sixty adults with chronic, untreated HIV infection (n = 80 with HCV co-infection and n = 80 HIV mono-infected) and 80 demographically similar healthy controls were recruited from the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City and the surrounding community, respectively.

Repeated multivariate and group-based trajectory analyses (GBTA) examined neurocognitive subgroup profiles of the co-infected individuals after 72 weeks of de novo efavirenz- (n = 41) or raltegravir-based (n = 39) ART. Results: Baseline analyses revealed worse motor function in HIV-HCV co-infected individuals compared to both comparison groups. Longitudinal analyses revealed improved neurocognitive performance by week 48 for most participants regardless of treatment arm. GBTA identified a subgroup (35% of HIV-HCV sample) with persistent motor impairment despite otherwise successful ART. Higher HIV viral load and lower CD4+ T cell count at baseline predicted persistent motor dysfunction.

This paper offers a critical literature review on supply chain efficiency that aims to reveal the basic research that has been carried out, the problem areas and requirements for the efficiency in the new era of the supply chain. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology followed during this research involves beginning with a wide base of articles lying at the supply chain intersection, performance measurement topics, and then screening the list to concentrate on supply chain efficiency. Findings: Findings show that supply chain efficiency in the modern era remains an open research field. This research contributes to the supply chain literature by clarifying the supply chain efficiency definition, defining key measurements and variables for supply chain efficiency and developing a supply chain efficiency framework to improve overall performance. Practical implications: This study will be very useful to the scholars working in this field. The proposed framework would help researchers and academicians to understand every dimension and variable of supply chain efficiency, allowing practitioners to measure efficiency levels and identify improvement measures. This framework would also act as a comprehensive guide for future studies and business practices.

The level of glycosylinositolphosphorylceramide (GIPC), the most abundant sphingolipid in Arabidopsis thaliana, decreased upon phosphate starvation. NPC4 was highly induced by phosphate deficiency, and NPC4 knockouts in Arabidopsis decreased the loss of GIPC and impeded root growth during phosphate starvation. Enzymatic analysis showed that NPC4 hydrolyzed GIPC and displayed a higher activity toward GIPC as a substrate than toward the common glycerophospholipid phosphatidylcholine. NPC4 was associated with the plasma membrane lipid rafts in which GIPC is highly enriched.

Methods: A total of 666 AURORA patients completed self-report assessments in the ED and at 2 and 8 weeks after MVC. Peritraumatic distress, peritraumatic dissociation, and pre-MVC sleep characteristics (insomnia, nightmares, daytime sleepiness, and sleep duration in the 30 days before the MVC, trait sleep stress reactivity) were assessed retrospectively in the ED.

Methods: Neuropsychological performance z-scores (learning, retention, executive function, motor/psychomotor speed, language domains, and global cognition), and neuroimaging measures (brain volumetrics and white matter fractional anisotropy) were analyzed in PLWH (n ¼ 209) and HIV- (n ¼ 95) grouped according to the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden (ACB) scale (0 ¼ no burden, 1 – 3 ¼ low burden, >3 ¼ high burden). Neuropsychological performance and neuroimaging outcomes were compared between HIV- and PLWH with high anticholinergic burden. Within a cohort of PLWH (n ¼ 90), longitudinal change in ACB score over ~2 years was correlated to the rate of change per month of study interval in neuropsychological performance and neuroimaging measures. Results: A higher number of anticholinergic medications and ACB was observed in PLWH compared with HIV- (P < 0.05). A higher ACB was associated with worse motor/psychomotor performance, smaller occipital lobe, putamen, subcortical gray matter and total gray matter volumes in HIV-; and poorer executive function, retention and global cognition, smaller brain volumes (frontal, parietal and temporal lobes, hippocampus, amygdala, cortex, subcortical gray matter and total gray matter), and reduced fractional anisotropy (posterior corpus callosum, perforant pathway) in PLWH. PLWH with high anticholinergic burden performed worse on tests of learning and executive function compared with HIV- with high anticholinergic burden.

We present the first use of the Torion® portable gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) instrument for in situ chemical analysis of primate scents. We collected and analyzed swab samples from the scent glands and skin from 13 groups (57 individuals) of two sympatric species of wild emperor tamarins, Saguinus imperator, and Weddell's saddleback tamarins, Leontocebus weddelli (Callitrichidae). In total, 11 compounds of interest (i.e., probably derived from the animals) could be detected in the samples, with 31 of 215 samples containing at least one compound of interest. The composition of these 31 samples varied systematically with species, group, sex, and breeding status. Moreover, we tentatively identified seven of the compounds of interest as methyl hexanoate, benzaldehyde, ethyl hexanoate, acetophenone, a branched C15 alkane, 4-methoxybenzaldehyde, and hexadecan-1-ol. As the field of primate semiochemistry continues to grow, we believe that portable GC-MS instruments have the potential to help make progress in the study of primate chemosignaling in field conditions, despite limitations that we encountered.

Using a dataset from an OPP where users publish multimedia items and follow other users, we find that there is no one dominant consumer journey; instead, the sequences of stages in a journey (e.g., Learn → Feel → Do) vary across published items. Furthermore, we find that the social capital (i.e., social network) of a publisher influences the occurrence of spillover effects between latent stages (the phenomenon that one stage in a period triggers another stage in the next period) for the items posted by the publisher. We also find that a publisher’s social capital has only a transient impact on the consumer journeys for the publisher’s projects, underlining the importance of consistently making new network connections in order to promote the growth of user activities surrounding the publisher’s projects.

The dynamics of the pulse is described by a nonlinear equation for the vector potential of the electromagnetic field (it takes the form of a 3D generalization of the sine-Gordon equation), derived from the Maxwell's equations and averaged over the period of the HF control field. By means of systematic simulations, we demonstrate that, depending on the amplitude and frequency of the HF control, the ultrashort pulse approaching the barrier layer either passes it or bounces back. The layer's transmissivity for the incident pulse is significantly affected by the amplitude and frequency of the HF control field, with the reflection coefficient nearly vanishing in intervals that make up a discrete set of transparency windows, which resembles the effect of the electromagnetically induced transparency.

These species could not be studied near closest approach in mid-December because there was insufficient Doppler shift to separate the cometary emission from their corresponding telluric absorption lines. We employed the [O I] observations as a proxy for the CO2/H2O ratio, as CO2 cannot be observed directly from the ground, and space-based assets sensitive to CO2 were not able to observe 46P during this apparition. We focused our analysis on H2O, CO, CH4, C2H6, CH3OH, and CO2 (via [O I] emission). We detected strong emissions from H2O, C2H6, and CH3OH. Over the 3 nights, we found evidence for changing mixing ratios, mostly due to a variable H2O production rate. In 46P, C2H6 and CH3OH are enriched compared to cometary averages, with mixing ratios relative to H2O of ∼1% and ∼3%, respectively. Measurements of CH4 and CO have been especially rare in JFCs.

To estimate US nonlethal violent victimization rates for lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) males and females aged 16 years and older and to compare disparities among LGB and straight males and females, controlling for other correlates of victimization. Methods. We used data from the 2017 and 2018 National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) to provide nationally representative rates of various forms of violent victimization for self-identified LGB and straight persons. Multivariable models assessed the risk for violence associated with LGB status. Results. Total violence rates were 2 to 9 times higher among LGB persons compared with heterosexuals. For some forms of violence (e.g., rape and sexual assault, violence with serious injuries, and multiple offender violence) there were notably high disparities between bisexuals and heterosexuals. With adjustment for covariates, LGB orientation was associated with odds ratios nearly 2 to 4 times those of heterosexuals. Conclusions. This is one of the first known uses of NCVS data to estimate LGB victimization, revealing substantially higher rates of violence directed at LGB individuals. Public Health Implications. Sexual orientation and gender identity questions in federal surveys such as the NCVS enable monitoring of violent victimization rates and should continue. Collecting these data can help researchers understand victimization risk and guide appropriate resources toward victim services, especially important given the high violent crime levels experienced by LGB individuals.

The post-FOMC announcement drift coincides with more informative order flows in the post-announcement period, and it persists for 15 days. Moreover, our study shows an absence of pre-FOMC announcement drift.

Factors Associated With Postpartum Diabetes Screening in Women With Gestational Diabetes and Medicaid During Pregnancy,OA,-,-,-,-,Green Accepted OA,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2020.08.028,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85097784265,,"Introduction: Women with gestational diabetes are 7 times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes and require lifelong diabetes screening. Loss of health coverage after pregnancy, as occurs in states that did not expand Medicaid, limits access to guideline-driven follow-up care and fosters health inequity. This study aims to understand the factors associated with the receipt of postpartum diabetes screening for women with gestational diabetes in a state without Medicaid expansion. Methods: Electronic health record and Medicaid claims data were linked to generate a retrospective cohort of 1,078 women with gestational diabetes receiving care in Federally Qualified Health Centers in Missouri from 2010 to 2015. In 2019–2020, data were analyzed to determine the factors associated with the receipt of recommended postpartum diabetes screening (fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test, or HbA1c in specified timeframes) using a Cox proportional hazards model through 18 months of follow-up. Results: Median age in this predominantly urban population was 28 (IQR=24−33) years. Self-reported racial or ethnic minorities comprised more than half of the population. Only 9.7% of women were screened at 12 weeks, and 20.8% were screened at 18 months. Prenatal certified diabetes education (adjusted hazard ratio=1.74, 95% CI=1.22, 2.49) and access to public transportation (adjusted hazard ratio=1.70, 95% CI=1.13, 2.54) were associated with increased screening in a model adjusted for race/ethnicity, the total number of prenatal visits, the use of diabetes medication during pregnancy, and a pregnancy-specific comorbidity index that incorporated age. Conclusions: This study underscores the importance of access to public transportation, prenatal diabetes education, and continued healthcare coverage for women on Medicaid to support the receipt of guideline-recommended follow-up care and improve health equity.",,10.1016/j.amepre.2020.08.028,18732607,222,National Institutes of Health,201510005,85097784265 (Scopus),07493797,2,231,2021-02-01,33317895.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2020.08.028,American Journal of Preventive Medicine,60

We advance the literature by examining the role of several potentially important shifts in individual attitudes and behaviors that may help to account for the observed temporal variation in youth delinquency. Our multilevel analysis of repeated cross-sectional data from eighth and tenth grade students in the Monitoring the Future (MTF) study indicates that changes in youth offending prevalence were not associated with changes in youth attachment and commitment to school, community involvement, or parental supervision after school. In contrast, the study provides suggestive evidence that the significant reduction in youth offending prevalence observed since the early 1990s was significantly associated with a decrease in unstructured socializing and alcohol consumption and, to a lesser extent, with a decrease in youth preferences for risky activities.

Design: We employed a cross-sectional posttest design with qualitative data collection and hermeneutic analysis. Setting and. Participants: Subjects were students from two cohorts in a Doctor of Nursing Practice program at a large metropolitan university in the Midwestern United States (n = 136). Methods: Following a dramatic exercise facilitated by a local theatre group, students debriefed and provided feedback via paper-based surveys collected by their instructor. The research team reviewed and analyzed student feedback with an eye toward new learning or insights around cultural difference. Results: Students rated the dramatic exercise highly. Their written feedback provided for a deeper exploration of how they internalized messages about cultural difference. These experiences were thematized in the following way: (a) Awareness is facilitated through integrating nonverbal (kinesthetic) and verbal encounters, (b) Hesitancy to participate in unfamiliar activities creates tension, and (c) Safety is a foundational aspect of learning sensitive issues. Conclusion: Dramatization of culturally sensitive scenarios for advanced practice nurses can lead to new understanding.

Carbon tax has proven to be an effective means to control emission and mitigate its negative impacts. This paper addresses the issue of optimal taxation target from the government's perspective. Three schemes of carbon tax are considered in a Stackelberg game setting: production-only, consumer-only and mixed-type, where the government leads to determine the taxation rate, and an enterprise follows to optimize its production level and emission reduction. Closed-form analytical solutions are obtained in each case with a numerical study to get additional insights. The paper founds that government's optimal decision on the taxation target depends on the magnitude of environmental impact of carbon emission. It may also vary with the performance metric to be achieved: maximizing social welfare as the government's objective, maximizing profit as the enterprise’ objective, or minimizing the amount of carbon emission as social benefit.

Despite the growing recognition that this loss can have a differential impact on an individual's mental health, research focused on women's positive psychological change and factors contributing to it following pregnancy loss is scarce. This study explored relationships among core belief challenge, rumination, and women's experience of posttraumatic growth following miscarriage or stillbirth. Specifically, this study investigated whether deliberate rumination mediated the relationship between core belief challenge and posttraumatic growth. Method: Women who had experienced miscarriage or stillbirth (n = 476) were recruited via social media and completed an online survey that assessed core belief challenge, event-related rumination, and posttraumatic growth. Loss context factors and demographics were also collected. Hypotheses were tested via hierarchical multiple regression and the PROCESS macro. Results: Change in beliefs about the world and rumination predicted posttraumatic growth. Moreover, deliberate, but not intrusive, rumination mediated the relationship between core belief challenge and posttraumatic growth.

Thus, LMX facilitates UPB willingness even when employees are high in moral identity.

Young adults (N = 599) were recruited from various schools and universities throughout the Netherlands. They were randomly assigned to one of 10 experimental vignettes. Findings demonstrate that, generally, scenarios describing more serious types of IPV as well as those describing a male perpetrator and a female victim received lower ratings of normality. Gender differences in perceptions were found and, moreover, the direction of these gender differences appeared to depend on the actual gender dynamics described in the IPV scenario. Prior IPV experiences increased perceptions of IPV normality among female respondents in particular. Moreover, the suggestion that respondents’ prior IPV experiences may better explain respondents’ IPV perceptions than respondents’ gender, was only partly supported. Our findings suggest that this is true for respondents’ prior psychological, but not physical IPV experiences and for the manipulations of the gender dynamics within the couple, but not so much for the type of violence employed. Implications of these findings are discussed. From a prevention perspective, greater insight into these perceptions is relevant as they have been shown to be related to help-seeking and reporting behavior in the case of experiencing or witnessing IPV.",,10.1177/0886260517746945,15526518,NP1412,,,85042594244 (Scopus),08862605,3-4,1440NP,2021-02-01,29295028.0,https://doi.org/10.1177/0886260517746945,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,36

Design/methodology/approach: This study tests the causality between searches and sales by using an instrumental variable approach. This study exploits the ideas that consumers’ perception of a product’s consumption risk is correlated with their search efforts and consumers use multiple information sources to infer a product’s consumption risk. As an instrument for a focal film’s search volume, this paper uses review disagreement for past movies related to the focal film. This paper incorporates the ideas in a model of weekly online search volume and revenues and apply it to a movie data set. Findings: Films’ search volume influences their revenues only until the opening week. A 10% increase in opening-week search volume generates a 7.4% increase in opening-week revenue, while the same increase in pre-launch search volume generates a 4.1% increase. Although searches are not an influencer of sales from the second week on, the random forest models and cross-validation studies find that weekly search volume is a strong predictor of weekly revenues in this period. Research limitations/implications: Testing the findings in other product categories is important for generalizing the findings. Practical implications: This study suggests different usage values for online searches, depending on a film’s lifecycle stages. Furthermore, given that review disagreement has a positive influence on opening-week revenue through searches, managers should encourage diverse opinions about their films until the opening week to increase sales through searches. Originality/value: Regarding the role of online search, previous studies have maintained the perspective that online search is a predictor of sales. This is the first study that finds causality between searches and sales for films.",,10.1108/EJM-08-2019-0655,,337,,,85096373925 (Scopus),03090566,2,362,2021-01-23,,https://doi.org/10.1108/EJM-08-2019-0655,European Journal of Marketing,55

The present study aimed to (a) examine the links between partner perceptions, three PTSD symptom clusters (i.e., avoidance, negative alterations in cognitions and mood, changes in arousal and reactivity), and aspects of parenting (i.e., support, satisfaction, involvement) and (b) determine if partner perceptions moderate these relationships. Method: In total, 225 trauma-exposed parents (M = 36.87, SD = 8.32, 64% female, 52.9% White) were assessed via self-report measures. Results: As expected, the negative alterations in cognitions and mood and arousal and reactivity clusters were negatively associated with partner perceptions (r = −.17 and −.24, respectively) and all three parenting indices (rs = −.15 to −.35). Avoidance symptoms were unrelated to partner perceptions but were tied to parental support and satisfaction (rs = −.15). Partner perceptions moderated the relationships between negative alterations in cognitions and mood and support and satisfaction (βs = .02), as well as changes in arousal and reactivity and support (β = .02). Conclusions: Parents with negative alterations in cognitions and mood and arousal and reactivity symptoms who perceive their partners negatively may be at higher risk for experiencing lower levels of parental support or satisfaction. Additionally, the negative links between the aforementioned symptom clusters and parenting disappeared in the context of positive partner perceptions, indicating a potential protective factor. <strong xmlns:lang=""en"">Clinical Impact Statement—This study suggests that opinions about one’s partner may alter the degree to which certain symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) affect aspects of parenting.

The purpose of this paper is to provide guidance for effectively estimating the financial effects of mitigating commodity price risk volatility (CPV) in supply chain management decisions. Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopts two prominent and complementary methodologies, namely, total cost of ownership (TCO and real options valuation (ROV), to illustrate how commodity price risk mitigation strategies can be analyzed with respect to their effect on costs and performance. The paper provides insights through a case study to demonstrate the application of these methods together and establish the benefits and challenges associated with their implementation. Findings: The paper illustrates advantages and disadvantages of TCO and ROV and how these approaches can be adopted together to contribute to effective purchasing decisions.

It is often useful to think in terms of the price elasticity of demand when reasoning about the demand curve. Firms wishing to invest in demand prediction and information gathering should reason about the relationship between the expected value of perfect information (EVPI) on demand and demand elasticity. Should firms pay more/less for information on demand if elasticity is high/low? Furthermore, when considering different product prices, correlation may exist between demand at different prices. Should firms pay more/less for information if the correlation between demand at different prices is high or low? This paper derives analytic and numeric results to answer these questions. We start with the assumption that demand is uncertain and follows a uniformly distributed band around a deterministic demand curve where the upper and lower bounds of the demand distribution vary with price. This formulation enables a closed form expression for EVPI that provides a useful benchmark. We find nuanced behavior of EVPI that depends on both the elasticity and the initial price preference. The EVPI approaches zero as elasticity increases (decreases) for a firm that initially prefers the low (high) price. Numerical results using the truncated normal and beta distributions relax assumptions about the uniform distribution and show EVPI is similar when the distribution variances are similar. Finally, we relax the assumption of perfect information and show the expected value of imperfect information (EVOI) follows similar patterns as EVPI with respect to demand elasticity.",,10.1016/j.ejor.2020.05.057,,511,National Science Foundation,1739551,85086843014 (Scopus),03772217,2,522,2021-01-16,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2020.05.057,European Journal of Operational Research,288
Association of Immunosuppression and Viral Load with Subcortical Brain Volume in an International Sample of People Living with HIV,OA,Gold OA,-,-,Green Final OA,-,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.31190,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85100125045,,"Importance: Despite more widely accessible combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), HIV-1 infection remains a global public health challenge. Even in treated patients with chronic HIV infection, neurocognitive impairment often persists, affecting quality of life. Identifying the neuroanatomical pathways associated with infection in vivo may delineate the neuropathologic processes underlying these deficits. However, published neuroimaging findings from relatively small, heterogeneous cohorts are inconsistent, limiting the generalizability of the conclusions drawn to date. Objective: To examine structural brain associations with the most commonly collected clinical assessments of HIV burden (CD4+T-cell count and viral load), which are generalizable across demographically and clinically diverse HIV-infected individuals worldwide. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study established the HIV Working Group within the Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics Through Meta Analysis (ENIGMA) consortium to pool and harmonize data from existing HIV neuroimaging studies. In total, data from 1295 HIV-positive adults were contributed from 13 studies across Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America. Regional and whole brain segmentations were extracted from data sets as contributing studies joined the consortium on a rolling basis from November 1, 2014, to December 31, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Volume estimates for 8 subcortical brain regions were extracted from T1-weighted magnetic resonance images to identify associations with blood plasma markers of current immunosuppression (CD4+T-cell counts) or detectable plasma viral load (dVL) in HIV-positive participants. Post hoc sensitivity analyses stratified data by cART status. Results: After quality assurance, data from 1203 HIV-positive individuals (mean [SD] age, 45.7 [11.5] years; 880 [73.2%] male; 897 [74.6%] taking cART) remained. Lower current CD4+cell counts were associated with smaller hippocampal (mean [SE] β = 16.66 [4.72] mm3per 100 cells/mm3; P <.001) and thalamic (mean [SE] β = 32.24 [8.96] mm3per 100 cells/mm3; P <.001) volumes and larger ventricles (mean [SE] β = -391.50 [122.58] mm3per 100 cells/mm3; P =.001); in participants not taking cART, however, lower current CD4+cell counts were associated with smaller putamen volumes (mean [SE] β = 57.34 [18.78] mm3per 100 cells/mm3; P =.003). A dVL was associated with smaller hippocampal volumes (d = -0.17; P =.005); in participants taking cART, dVL was also associated with smaller amygdala volumes (d = -0.23; P =.004). Conclusions and Relevance: In a large-scale international population of HIV-positive individuals, volumes of structures in the limbic system were consistently associated with current plasma markers.

The relationship between these two methods has been studied recently. This relationship leads to new types of diffusion equations and helps to design the wavelet/frame-inspired diffusivity functions, and on the other hand it helps to design the diffusion-inspired shrinkage functions with a better performance in signal and image denoising. Multiwavelets have important properties such as orthogonality, short support, and symmetry, etc. that scalar orthogonal wavelets cannot possess simultaneously. There is rich literature on the theoretical study, construction and applications of multiwavelets. In particular, it has been shown that multiwavelets perform better than the scalar wavelets in signal and image denoising. Recently multiwavelet denoising has been applied in different applications including rolling bearing fault detection and study of load spectrum of computer numerical control lathe. Therefore it is worth to further study multiwavelet denoising. In this paper we investigate the correspondence between multiwavelet denoising and nonlinear diffusion. We show that the multiwavelet shrinkages of the commonly used CL(2) and DGHM multiwavelets are associated with a second-order nonlinear diffusion equation. We also derive high-order nonlinear diffusion equations associated with general multiwavelet shrinkages.

Formation of the b2+H2O anions requires rate-limiting intramolecular back biting to cleave the second amide bond and generate an anhydride structure. Facile cleavage of the newly formed ester bond with concerted expulsion of a cyclic anhydride neutral generates the product structure. IR spectroscopy supports this b2+H2O anion having structures that are essentially identical to C-terminally deprotonated arginylglycine, [RG-H]-. Formation of the c2 anion is predicted to require concerted expulsion of CO2 from the aspartyl side chain carboxylate and cleavage of the N-Calpha bond to produce a proton-bound dimer of arginylglycinamide and acrylate. Proton transfers within the dimer then enable predominant detection of a c2 anion with the negative charge nominally on the central, glycine nitrogen (amidate structure) as the proton affinity of this structure is predicted to be lower than acrylate by ∼27 kJ mol-1. Alternate means of cleaving the same N-Calpha bond produce deprotonated cis-1,4-dibut-2-enoic acid z1 anion structures.

There exist both input model and simulation estimation uncertainties in the system performance estimates. Without strong prior information on the input models and the system mean response surface, in this paper, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric framework to quantify the impact from both sources of uncertainty. Specifically, since the real-world data often represent the variability caused by various latent sources of uncertainty, Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) based nonparametric input models are introduced to model a mixture of heterogeneous distributions, which can faithfully capture the important features of real-world data, such as multimodality and skewness. Bayesian posteriors of flexible input models characterize the input model estimation uncertainty, which automatically accounts for both model selection and parameter value uncertainty. Then input model estimation uncertainty is propagated to outputs by using direct simulation. Thus, under very general conditions, our framework delivers an empirical credible interval accounting for both input and simulation uncertainties. A variance decomposition is further developed to quantify the relative contributions from both sources of uncertainty.

Mortality Prediction Using SaO<inf>2</inf>/FiO<inf>2</inf> Ratio Based on eICU Database Analysis,OA,Gold OA,-,-,Green Final OA,-,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/6672603,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85119999881,,"Purpose. PaO2 to FiO2 ratio (P/F) is used to assess the degree of hypoxemia adjusted for oxygen requirements. The Berlin definition of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) includes P/F as a diagnostic criterion. P/F is invasive and cost-prohibitive for resource-limited settings. SaO2/FiO2 (S/F) ratio has the advantages of being easy to calculate, noninvasive, continuous, cost-effective, and reliable, as well as lower infection exposure potential for staff, and avoids iatrogenic anemia. Previous work suggests that the SaO2/FiO2 ratio (S/F) correlates with P/F and can be used as a surrogate in ARDS. Quantitative correlation between S/F and P/F has been verified, but the data for the relative predictive ability for ICU mortality remains in question. We hypothesize that S/F is noninferior to P/F as a predictive feature for ICU mortality. Using a machine-learning approach, we hope to demonstrate the relative mortality predictive capacities of S/F and P/F. Methods. We extracted data from the eICU Collaborative Research Database. The features age, gender, SaO2, PaO2, FIO2, admission diagnosis, Apache IV, mechanical ventilation (MV), and ICU mortality were extracted. Mortality was the dependent variable for our prediction models. Exploratory data analysis was performed in Python. Missing data was imputed with Sklearn Iterative Imputer. Random assignment of all the encounters, 80% to the training (n = 26690) and 20% to testing (n = 6741), was stratified by positive and negative classes to ensure a balanced distribution. We scaled the data using the Sklearn Standard Scaler. Categorical values were encoded using Target Encoding. We used a gradient boosting decision tree algorithm variant called XGBoost as our model. Model hyperparameters were tuned using the Sklearn RandomizedSearchCV with tenfold cross-validation. We used AUC as our metric for model performance. Feature importance was assessed using SHAP, ELI5 (permutation importance), and a built-in XGBoost feature importance method. We constructed partial dependence plots to illustrate the relationship between mortality probability and S/F values. Results. The XGBoost hyperparameter optimized model had an AUC score of.85 on the test set. The hyperparameters selected to train the final models were as follows: colsample_bytree of 0.8, gamma of 1, max_depth of 3, subsample of 1, min_child_weight of 10, and scale_pos_weight of 3. The SHAP, ELI5, and XGBoost feature importance analysis demonstrates that the S/F ratio ranks as the strongest predictor for mortality amongst the physiologic variables. The partial dependence plots illustrate that mortality rises significantly above S/F values of 200. Conclusion.

However, longer-term associations between cognition and WM organization following SRC have not been studied. The objective of this study was to compare WM organization and cognitive performance in collegiate athletes an average of almost 4 years post-SRC to athletes with no history of SRC. Method: National Collegiate Athletic Association Division III athletes (n = 71, age = 19.3 ± 1.2; 14 with self-reported SRC) completed a neurocognitive assessment and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). WM organization was assessed by extracting measures of fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and radial diffusivity (RD) from 20 WM regions of interest (ROIs). Multivariate partial least squares analyses were used to compare athletes with and without a history of SRC and assess relationships between DTI-derived metrics of WM organization and cognitive measures. Results: Cognitive performance and ROI metrics did not differ between athletes with and without prior SRC. However, among athletes with a history of SRC, better executive function, processing speed, and memory but worse choice reaction time were associated with higher FA and lower MD and RD in several WM tracts. Conclusion: Athletes with a history of SRC demonstrated greater associations between cognitive performance and WM organization, but also variability in the domains showing associations. Taken together, the findings demonstrate the importance of examining brain-behavior relationships several years after SRC to better gauge how WM organization supports cognition.",,10.1080/13803395.2021.1991893,1744411X,704,National Institutes of Health,K02AA025123,85119361545 (Scopus),13803395,7,715,2021-01-01,34779351.0,https://doi.org/10.1080/13803395.2021.1991893,Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology,43
What Does it Mean That it Doesn’t Hurt?

This adds to existing evidence that people with a history of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) similarly report reduced laboratory pain (for a meta-analysis, see Koenig et al., 2016). Given that the majority of people with BPD have a history of NSSI, it is increasingly well-established that BPD is associated with reduced experience of acute pain, particularly in terms of reporting higher pain thresholds and lower pain intensities. As Fales and colleagues (in press) discuss, this is an intriguing phenomenon with potentially significant clinical implications: a diminished, if not wholly absent, acute pain response could explain why people with BPD engage in NSSI, a behavior that should ordinarily cause significant pain and, thus, be highly aversive. This pain analgesia hypothesis is frequently invoked in the NSSI and BPD literatures. However, important gaps remain in connecting pain in the laboratory to pain during real-life NSSI. In this commentary, we build upon the important work of Fales and colleagues (in press) to highlight the need to better understand the role of pain during NSSI in daily life",,10.1037/cps0000042,14682850,358,,,85119266906 (Scopus),09695893,4,359,2021-01-01,,https://doi.org/10.1037/cps0000042,Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice,28

However, current research aims to contextualize this parenting behavior. This study examined the relation between intrusive parenting and early childhood behavior problems or emotion regulation, as well as the moderating role of race/ethnicity and developmental delay. Participants (n = 511; 47.4% male) were part of a larger, longitudinal Early Head Start study, entitled Baby FACES, with a racially and ethnically diverse sample (40.1% White, 18.7% Black, and 41.2% Hispanic). Behavior problems and developmental delay were assessed via parent report, while parent intrusiveness and emotion regulation were rated by observers. More use of intrusive parenting at age 2 was associated with greater behavior problems and less emotion regulation at age 3. However, this relation was moderated by race/ethnicity and developmental level. Greater intrusiveness was related to increased behavior problems and poorer emotion regulation for White and Hispanic/ Latino families; they were unrelated in Black families. Similarly, although intrusive parenting and behavior problems were positively associated at all developmental levels, the relation was strongest for children with typical development. Further, fewer maternal risk factors, being female, and being Hispanic/Latino were associated with higher emotion regulation, and more risk factors were associated with more behavior problems. These findings highlight the importance of considering how a child’s context and development interact with parenting style.

Millions who develop breast cancer are younger than retirement age and at a lifetime risk for developing BCRL. Rural and small-town survivors may face unique challenges in terms of access to health care and BCRL/survivorship resources. This multiple-case study describes how BCRL influences the work experiences and quality of life (QoL) of survivors living in rural and small towns in Missouri. Methods and Materials: Thirteen survivors from rural and small towns in Missouri completed semi-structured interviews and a standardized QoL instrument. Cases were analyzed using in-vivo and open-coding techniques and constant cross-case comparative methods. Twelve of the 13 participants’ data are synthesized into themes to represent an illustrative case. The 13th case is presented as a contradictory (rival) case. Results: Four themes are represented within the illustrative case – multiple medical encounters; the development of self-care routines; the reciprocity of work/live activities, triggers, and adjustments; and rural/small-town cultural impact. Upon BCRL diagnosis, survivors received intensive treatments, eventually establishing self-care routines. Survivors identified strategies for working around their BCRL when completing work and home responsibilities. The contradictory (rival) case was more recently diagnosed and, as such, had not established self-care and coping mechanisms in the same way. Conclusions and implications: Survivors alleviate BCRL symptoms and improve their QoL by establishing self-care strategies. This provides guidance for client-centered survivorship care-planning and occupational rehabilitation of rural survivors with BCRL. This study provides the foundation for developing information for rural survivors that supports mental preparation and coping skills for BCRL self-management.",100459,10.1016/j.ctarc.2021.100459,24682942,,National Institute of Nursing Research,T32NR015426,85115604515 (Scopus),,,,2021-01-01,34563789.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctarc.2021.100459,Cancer Treatment and Research Communications,29

Expanding the notion of translanguaging, we conceptualize community translanguaging as collaborative meaning-making among children, their family and community members, and their collective semiotic resources. Using a family literacy project as the research site, this article showcases how participating families built (on) cultural and semiotic wealth beyond the individual’s and across diverse sign systems; this was demonstrated both in the process and as the product of family storybooks. Taking an ecological approach and drawing from the notions of spatial repertoires, assemblages, and distributed/collaborative agency, the analysis shows that languaging is inherently social, intertextual, multimodal, and contingent on the dynamic of the semiotic ecology. Families collaborated, cross-culturally, metalinguistically, multimodally, and across generations, to discuss, write, draw, and digitize their family stories. This expanded concept of community translanguaging counters the coded notion of language and resulting separatist paradigm of language education with pedagogical implications. Leveraging community repertoires provides new opportunities to create educational space(s) where more/various semiotic resources can be drawn upon to maximize creativity in teaching and learning.

The present study examines the associations of traditional ecological predictors of substance use with concurrent alcohol and cannabis use among African-American adolescents. It also examines whether racial identity, a culturally relevant factor, is associated with concurrent use beyond the influence of traditional factors. Method: Secondary analyses were conducted based on a large survey of high school adolescents. Responses on self-report measures of substance use and psychosocial determinants of health were examined for those respondents in grades 9–12 who identified as African American (N = 465; 59.8% female). Results: Findings demonstrated that traditional risk and resilience factors, including externalizing symptoms and substance use beliefs, were related to alcohol and cannabis co-use relative to other patterns of use among African-American adolescents. Racial identity dimensions were also associated with alcohol and cannabis co-use beyond the influence of traditional factors. However, the direction of these associations varied by dimension.

It shows a sense in which Visegrad and Balkan EU countries are correlated in macroeconomic performance and integrated with the global business cycles. Using inflation rate levels as a starting point to characterize when these countries began their transitions, it shows that after 1996 both real GDP growth and real interest rates move together to a significant degree both with each other and with the US. This provides a background from which to view the paths since the collapse of the Soviet Union that these transition economies have taken. In addition, comparison is made to US money and banking policy, to provide an outline of how this may impact progress in the transition region. A subsequent summary of the other articles in the issue shows an inter-relation in their themes about how Central, Eastern, and Southeast Europe have progressed since 1991, and how these paths may be affected by Western economic policy. Implications for Central European audience: The paper shows that transition regions can be impacted by international financial integration, including to possible detriment when capital markets are regulated by policy that pushes real interest rates below their natural levels. Negative real interest rate policy since the 2008-2009 financial crisis and again during the Covid crisis may hasten the rise of autocratic democracy and limit social, political, and economic freedom.",,10.18267/J.CEBR.282,18054862,1,University of Missouri,,85108566361 (Scopus),18054854,2,20,2021-01-01,,https://doi.org/10.18267/J.CEBR.282,Central European Business Review,10

Risks associated with primate release include ecosystem disruption, inability of released primates to engage in normal foraging and social behaviors, and pathogen spillover. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has several guidelines for the rehabilitation and release of trafficked primates intended to minimize such risks, though little is known about the use of these guidelines during primate confiscation, rehabilitation, and release or about the challenges faced by those who attempt to implement such guidelines in specific contexts. As one of the leading sources of Neotropical primate trade in the world, Peru has a primate population particularly vulnerable to the negative consequences of trafficked primate release. This study used semi-structured interviews and structured questionnaires of 19 people involved in primate confiscation, rehabilitation, and/or release in Peru and found that awareness and implementation of the IUCN guidelines are minimal. Opportunities to increase guideline implementation in Peru include expanding government involvement and support, adapting guidelines to specific contexts and locations, and establishing a platform for increased communication, cooperation, and research amongst those performing this work.",,,,,National Institutes of Health,KL2TR002545,85107070679 (Scopus),08986207,35,,2021-01-01,,,Primate Conservation,

Yet few studies have examined if and when social contexts shift during cannabis use treatment. This study examined daily shifts in youths’ social contexts with the goal of characterizing how specific social contexts (e.g., time with cannabis-using friends or siblings) relate to cannabis craving and use during cannabis treatment. Method: Participants were 65 cannabis users (51% male), ages 15–24 years, who participated in a double-blind randomized clinical trial that tested the effects of motivational enhancement and cognitive behavioral therapies plus either adjunctive pharmacotherapy or placebo on cannabis craving and use. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data, collected from a pre-randomization period through the completion of the six-week intervention, assessed youths’ social contexts, cannabis use, and craving. Results: Time-varying effects models identified shifts in social contexts during treatment. Overall, time spent with cannabis-using friends and siblings decreased, where time spent with non-using friends or alone increased across the trial. Time with parents or non-using siblings was unchanged. Comparing the relative associations of social contexts with same-day craving and use, more time with cannabis-using friends and with siblings was uniquely associated with greater craving and use. Conclusions: Social context is an important factor in youth substance-use treatment. While time spent with cannabis-using friends and siblings decreased over treatment for all participants, those who continued to spend time with using individuals reported greater craving and use. This research supports increased attention to shifting youths’ social contexts to enhance treatment success.

The demand for naloxone, the opioid overdose antidote, is outpacing the supply. With increasing naloxone requests, tools to prioritize distribution are critical to ensure available supplies will reach those at highest risk of overdose. Methods: We developed a standardized “Naloxone Request Form” (NRF) and corresponding weighted prioritization algorithm to serve as decisional aid to better enable grant staff to prioritize naloxone distribution in a data-driven manner. The algorithm computed raw priority scores for each agency, which were then separated into the predetermined quintiles. Historical naloxone distribution decisions were compared with agencies’ prioritization quintile. Results: Results demonstrated that the NRF and corresponding algorithm was successful at prioritizing agencies based on potential impact. Although, overall, naloxone was distributed more heavily to the agencies deemed highest priority, our algorithm identified significant shortcomings of the “first come, first served” method of distribution we had initially deployed. Conclusions: This work has laid the foundation to use this tool prospectively to allow for data-driven decision-making for naloxone distribution. Our tool is flexible and can be customized to best fit the needs of a variety of programs and locations to ensure the distribution of limited supplies of naloxone have the greatest impact.",,10.1080/08897077.2021.1901174,15470164,974,Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration,1H79SP022118,85103036358 (Scopus),08897077,4,982,2021-01-01,33759727.0,https://doi.org/10.1080/08897077.2021.1901174,Substance Abuse,42

We identified LONG CHAIN ACYL-COA SYNTHETASE 4 (LACS4) in a screen for enhanced IBA resistance in primary root elongation in Arabidopsis thaliana. LACSs activate substrates by catalyzing the addition of CoA, the necessary first step for fatty acids to participate in b-oxidation or other metabolic pathways. Here, we describe the novel role of LACS4 in hormone metabolism and postulate that LACS4 catalyzes the addition of CoA onto IBA, the first step in its b-oxidation. lacs4 is resistant to the effects of IBA in primary root elongation and dark-grown hypocotyl elongation, and has reduced lateral root density. lacs6 also is resistant to IBA, although both lacs4 and lacs6 remain sensitive to IAA in primary root elongation, demonstrating that auxin responses are intact. LACS4 has in vitro enzymatic activity on IBA, but not IAA or IAA conjugates, and disruption of LACS4 activity reduces the amount of IBA-derived IAA in planta.

Therefore, alternative strategies should be developed to improve therapeutic efficacy and decrease toxicity. Here we report the possibility of employing a monolithic nanoporous gold (np-Au) rod as an implant for delivering DOX.

The high prevalence and pervasive detrimental impacts of alcohol use disorder (AUD) and smoking of tobacco necessitate more studies designed to identify factors closely associated with these outcomes in specific populations. The analyses reported in the present paper concern the relative utilities of five measures of personality and personality pathology rated by three sources (self, informant, and interviewer) in predicting AUD and regular smoking in a representative sample of 987 older adults, an understudied and uniquely vulnerable population. All measures and sources contributed to the predictions, with notable parallels as well as some important differences identified across substances and sources of information. In particular, low agreeableness robustly predicted AUD and smoking across self- and informant-reports. High interviewer-rated borderline personality pathology also strongly predicted AUD. Model fit indices suggested that measures of personality and personality pathology have stronger utility in predicting AUD as compared to regular smoking. These findings have important implications for the assessment of older adults in research and clinical settings and for the understanding of enduring risk factors for substance misuse later in life.

This is important in underage drinkers, many of whom drink heavily despite negative consequences. Most work has focused on the amount of alcohol consumed, but amount provides limited information about consumption patterns compared to rate of consumption, or how fast individuals drink. We therefore examined associations of both amount and rate of consumption with negative and positive outcomes (immediate affective states and next-morning consequences) in daily life. Method: Ninety-five college students aged 18–20 years completed ecological momentary assessment over 28 days. Participants reported number of standard drinks consumed and positive and negative affect hourly within drinking episodes. Estimated blood alcohol concentration (eBAC) values were used to create amount and rate of consumption indicators. Each morning after drinking, participants reported negative (e.g., blackout, hangover) and positive (e.g., new friend, making others laugh) consequences. Results: Within drinking episodes, multilevel models showed faster consumption was associated with reduced negative affect and both larger amount and faster consumption were associated with greater positive affect. Further, amount and rate were both associated with greater likelihood of a negative consequence the next morning. Rate, but not amount, was associated with more positive consequences. Conclusions: Not only how much but also how fast individuals drink may be important for the positive and negative outcomes they experience. Interventions to reduce negative alcohol-related outcomes should consider not only amount, but also rate of consumption.",108407,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108407,18790046,,National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism,K01AA022938,85097106125 (Scopus),03768716,,,2021-01-01,33257198.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108407,Drug and Alcohol Dependence,218

Previous research has found that sleep-directed hypnosis improves subjective sleep quality, particularly sleep onset latency, in women with PTSD. However, it cannot be assumed that improvements in subjective sleep reports correspond with objectively measured sleep improvements, because research has indicated a lack of agreement across these measures. The current study examined the effects of sleep-directed hypnosis plus cognitive processing therapy (hypCPT) on objective indices of sleep quality measured with actigraphy. Method: Forty-five women with PTSD were randomized to receive sleepdirected hypCPT or sleep and psychiatric symptom monitoring plus CPT (ssmCPT). Pre and posttreatment, participants completed 1 week of daily actigraphy assessments of nocturnal sleep onset latency, waking after sleep onset, and total sleep time. Results: Overall improvement in objective sleep indices was not observed. Despite this, at posttreatment, treatment completers receiving hypCPT took significantly less time to fall asleep than did women receiving ssmCPT.

The synchrosqueezing transform (SST) is a powerful method for instantaneous frequency estimation and component separation of non-stationary multicomponent signals. The short-time Fourier transform-based SST (FSST) reassigns the frequency variable to sharpen the time-frequency representation and to separate the components of a multicomponent non-stationary signal. Very recently the FSST with a time-varying parameter, called the adaptive FSST, was introduced.

Unique cultural factors, such as discrimination and racial identity, influence substance use during this period, but it is unknown whether they influence more severe patterns such as polysubstance use. The current study identifies prototypical patterns of substance use among Black young adults and examines whether cultural factors are associated with those patterns. Design: The current study used latent class analysis to characterize prototypical substance use among a community-based sample of Black young adults (N = 147). Culturally relevant correlates of substance use classes (i.e., perceived discrimination and racial identity) were examined in univariate and multivariate models. Results: Five profiles of substance use emerged, including three characterized by polysubstance use. In univariate models only, racial identity was differentially associated with membership in classes characterized by co-use of alcohol and cannabis. In both models, discrimination was significantly associated with membership in a class characterized by polysubstance use. Conclusion: Findings suggest a need to integrate cultural resilience factors into substance use interventions for Black young adults. Helping Black youth build coping skills for discrimination may also confer resilience against polysubstance use and associated health disparities.

The review intends to approach the topic from the catalysis and carbohydrate perspective to encourage researchers from both the fields to perform research in the area. The article covers the basics in glycosylation and catalysis chemistry. The catalysts for the reaction can be roughly divided into two groups. In one group, the catalysts serve as Lewis acids. In the other group, the catalysts play a higher sophisticated role, are involved in all elementary steps of the mechanism and remain coordinated to the substrate throughout the whole catalytic cycle. Based on selected examples, the main trends in transition metal catalyzed glycosylation reactions are explained. Lewis acid catalysts tend to require a somewhat higher catalyst load compared to other organometallic catalysts. The reaction conditions such as the temperature and time depend in many cases on the leaving group employed. An outlook is also presented.

Here, we examine beta diversity among assemblages of small mammals in the Cerrado domain of Brazil to partition the effects of turnover and nestedness on species distributions. Our objective was to evaluate whether balanced spatial variation in abundance (β bal) and abundance gradients (β gra) are congruent within and among habitats and localities of the Brazilian Cerrado. In addition, we wanted to understand whether ecological mechanisms, such as dispersal limitation, habitat filtering, and species sorting, drive the distribution patterns of the Cerrado small mammals. We analyzed the occurrence and abundances of small mammals from 16 localities widely distributed across the Cerrado biome, and grouped our data with respect to two distinct spatial scales. Baselga's Bray-Curtis index of dissimilarity and its respective partitions, i.e., balanced variation in abundance (β  bal) and abundance gradients (β gra), were estimated between sampling units at the two spatial scales. Thus, we used exponential models to search for distance decay in species similarity between pairs of localities and between similar habitats. Our results show that differences between small mammal assemblages in the Cerrado are driven mainly by species replacement rather than independent gain or loss of species, both at small and large scales. The spatial turnover patterns of small mammals in the Cerrado biome are determined by a combination of large scale (biogeographic, spatial) and local mechanisms (low dispersal and habitat specificity). However, processes occurring at small scales seem to be more important in species sorting than processes occurring at large scales. The spatial configuration of the landscape and the extent and quality of habitats strongly influence the rate of species turnover in Cerrado. Thus, protecting the different types of habitats should be of prime importance to conserving the diversity of Cerrado small mammals.",,10.1093/jmammal/gyaa085,15451542,1438,,,85104862768 (Scopus),00222372,6,1450,2020-12-01,,https://doi.org/10.1093/jmammal/gyaa085,Journal of Mammalogy,101

However, the role of romantic partners for women is less understood. Do partners exert a prosocial “protective” effect or are they criminogenic? The present study empirically drills down on this question. Specifically, we assess the character and quality of romantic relationships on substance use and illegitimate income using a sample of incarcerated women. Drawing from social control, social learning, and strain theory, we hypothesize that the effects of both being in and breaking up from a relationship on illicit behavior are conditional on the quality of the relationship and behavior/characteristics of the partner. Using data from the Women’s Experience of Violence (WEV) project, consisting of a custodial sample of criminal justice-involved women (N = 770), we examine how relationship status and quality, as well as partner offending, influence drug use and illicit earnings. A series of multi-level random effects models are estimated to explore how within-person changes in relationship/breakup status are related to changes in the two dependent variables. Contrary to expectations, we find that romantic dissolution (of either a high- or low-quality relationship) does not negatively impact this sample of women and that being in a high-quality relationship is not a protective factor, as has been found often in male samples. Findings suggest partner behavior may be more important than the quality of the relationship with the partner.

These positive effects are amplified in divesting firms facing financial decline as compared to firms that are maintaining their historical accounting performance. We find that the exclusivity of firm-advisor ties can be a double-edged sword, revealed by its nonmonotonic effect on post-divestiture performance.

CBCT was developed for college students and has been adapted for several unique populations, such as children in foster care, but it has only recently been used with parents of infants and young children. This analysis of data from a preliminary efficacy study examined effects of CBCT on parenting interactions and early empathy in infants and young children (aged 9 months to 5 years, 4 months). The study also examined the perceived benefits and challenges of participating in a 20-h CBCT intervention for parents. Methods: Thirty-nine families from university-affiliated preschools participated in this study; 25 parents were in the CBCT group and 14 parents were in a wait list control group. Parents were evaluated before and after the intervention, as well as after each session on their impressions of the class and experience with the assignments. Families were evaluated at pre- and post-intervention on observed parent-child interactions and child empathy. Results: Parents found that participating in CBCT was a positive, even life-changing experience for them, though finding time to practice the guided meditations was difficult. However, CBCT did not improve sensitive and responsive interactions between parents and children or young children’s empathy assessed in a lab setting. Conclusions: CBCT for parents was viewed positively by participants but it did not change their observed parenting interactions or young children’s observed empathy across a 3-month period.",,10.1007/s12671-020-01495-3,18688535,2841,A.L.

Neuroimaging research has implicated cortical midline brain structures, including the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and isthmus cingulate (IsthCing), in rumination in healthy and depressed populations. While past research has revealed dysfunction in cortical midline regions in PTSD, no studies have yet investigated the structural and functional neural mechanisms underlying rumination in women with PTSD. In the current study, we used structural MRI and resting-state fMRI to examine relationships between rumination and brain volume, as well as resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of cortical midline structures in women with PTSD due to interpersonal trauma (N = 71). We performed multiple linear regression analyses to relate brain volume in rACC, PCC, and IsthCing regions to self-reported rumination, after controlling for age and total intracranial volume. We also conducted standard seed-based voxelwise rsFC analyses for significant regions identified in the structural analysis. We found a significant relationship between greater rumination and volume in the left IsthCing (p =.025). Results from the rsFC analyses revealed a significant relationship between greater rumination and diminished rsFC between the left IsthCing and left precuneus (pFWE <.05).

Peripheral immune markers included C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), thymidine phosphorylase (TYMP), transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Associations of these markers with thickness and surface area of cortical regions were evaluated. A mediation analysis examined whether associations of inflammatory markers with cognitive functioning were mediated by brain cortical thickness and surface area.

A Psychometric Assessment of OCB: Clarifying the Distinction Between OCB and CWB and Developing a Revised OCB Measure,-,-,-,-,-,-,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10869-019-09653-8,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85074687222,"Item response theory, Measurement, Organizational citizenship behavior, Scale","This study was performed to (1) assess the appropriateness of using negatively worded items in organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) scales, (2) psychometrically demonstrate the construct distinctness of OCB and counterproductive work behavior (CWB), and (3) report on a revised, short-form OCB scale. Leveraging classical test theory (CTT) and item response theory (IRT), we demonstrate that the negatively worded items from a popular OCB scale (Williams and Anderson 1991) do not measure OCB, but rather a unique construct (CWB). CTT analyses (factor analyses) indicate that the negatively worded items load onto a unique factor when the scale is analyzed on its own and load onto a CWB factor when the scale is analyzed with a CWB scale. Additionally, IRT analyses indicate that the negatively worded items exhibit lower discrimination parameters and higher levels of local independence than the positively worded items, and similar discrimination parameters and levels of local independence as the CWB items. In turn, IRT analyses were used to identify the best items from the OCB scale to create a revised, short-form scale. The short-form scale showed comparable or improved convergent and discriminant validity and internal consistency reliability, as well as similar patterns of psychometric information yielded from IRT analyses, compared to the original scale. In short, the revised measure better aligns with conceptual definitions of OCB, demonstrates acceptable psychometric characteristics, and, given its reduced length, is of more practical value to researchers wishing to assess this construct within different types of research designs (e.g., longitudinal, multi-source).",,10.1007/s10869-019-09653-8,1573353X,697,,,85074687222 (Scopus),08893268,6,712,2020-12-01,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10869-019-09653-8,Journal of Business and Psychology,35

FH of alcohol dependence and trauma has been separately shown to adversely affect planning/problem-solving aspects of executive function. However, few studies have examined these risk factors in an integrated model. Methods: Using data from trauma-exposed individuals from the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism prospective cohort (N = 1,860), comprising offspring from alcohol-dependent high-risk and comparison families (mean age [SE] = 21.9 [4.2]), we investigated associations of trauma (nonsexual assaultive, nonassaultive, sexual assaultive) with DSM-IV PTSD and alcohol dependence symptom counts, and planning/problem-solving abilities assessed using the Tower of London Test (TOLT). Moderating effects of family history density of alcohol use disorder (FHD) on these associations and sex differences were explored. Results: Family history density was positively associated with PTSD in female participants who endorsed a sexual assaultive trauma. Exposure to nonsexual assaultive trauma was associated with more excess moves made on the TOLT. Conclusion: Findings from this study demonstrate associations with PTSD and alcohol dependence symptom counts, as well as poor problem-solving ability in trauma-exposed individuals from families densely affected with alcohol dependence, depending on trauma type, FHD, and sex.

The Ages and Stages Questionnaire-Third Edition measured developmental status at age 2 (typically developing, in a monitoring zone, or having a DD), behaviour problems were assessed at age 2, and supportive and negative parenting at age 3. Developmental delay moderated the relationship between behaviour problems and supportive parenting such that greater behaviour problems were unrelated to parental supportiveness for children with DD, while greater behaviour problems led to less parental supportiveness for typically developing children. These findings suggest distinct developmental processes, with parental supportiveness acting as potentially protective for children with DD.",e2199,10.1002/icd.2199,15227219,,,,85090185546 (Scopus),15227227,6,,2020-11-01,,https://doi.org/10.1002/icd.2199,Infant and Child Development,29

However, rapid evolutionary radiations pose significant challenges for phylogenetic inference (e.g. incomplete lineages sorting (ILS), phylogenetic noise), and the ability of targeted nuclear loci to resolve species trees despite such issues remains poorly studied. We test the utility of targeted sequence capture for inferring phylogenetic relationships in rapid, recent angiosperm radiations, focusing on Burmeistera bellflowers (Campanulaceae), which diversified into ~130 species over less than 3 million years. We compared phylogenies estimated from supercontig (exons plus flanking sequences), exon-only, and flanking-only datasets with 506–546 loci (~4.7 million bases) for 46 Burmeistera species/lineages and 10 outgroup taxa. Nuclear loci resolved backbone nodes and many congruent internal relationships with high support in concatenation and coalescent-based species tree analyses, and inferences were largely robust to effects of missing taxa and base composition biases. Nevertheless, species trees were incongruent between datasets, and gene trees exhibited remarkably high levels of conflict (~4–60% congruence, ~40–99% conflict) not simply driven by poor gene tree resolution. Higher gene tree heterogeneity at shorter branches suggests an important role of ILS, as expected for rapid radiations. Phylogenetic informativeness analyses also suggest this incongruence has resulted from low resolving power at short internal branches, consistent with ILS, and homoplasy at deeper nodes, with exons exhibiting much greater risk of incorrect topologies due to homoplasy than other datasets. Our findings suggest that targeted sequence capture is feasible for resolving rapid, recent angiosperm radiations, and that results based on supercontig alignments containing nuclear exons and flanking sequences have higher phylogenetic utility and accuracy than either alone. We use our results to make practical recommendations for future target capture-based studies of Burmeistera and other rapid angiosperm radiations, including that such studies should analyze supercontigs to maximize the phylogenetic information content of loci.",106769,10.1016/j.ympev.2020.106769,10959513,,National Science Foundation,1754802,85089440706 (Scopus),10557903,,,2020-11-01,32081762.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2020.106769,Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution,152

Data come from both self-reports (n = 1053 in adulthood) and official crime records (n = 1217). Regression analyses among those who used marijuana, cocaine, and/or heroin and had complete arrest data (n = 614) assess the association between adolescent vs. adult initiation, short vs. long duration of use, and their interaction with the outcomes of arrest, incarceration, and criminal career length, as well as meeting criteria for a drug use disorder. Results: Findings show that onset and duration are highly related, but when independent effects of duration and onset are assessed, only duration is a statistically significant predictor of all four crime outcomes, as well as a predictor of meeting criteria for a drug use disorder in adjusted regression models. Associations of duration with arrests held for all crime types (i.e., drug, property, violence). Adolescent vs. adult drug onset only predicted meeting lifetime criteria for a drug use disorder.

Method: Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and thematically coded using Dedoose software. Results: Six themes emerged as essential components for integrating contraceptive services into existing points-of-contact for women with OUD: (1) reach women with unmet need; (2) provide free or affordable contraception; (3) maximize service accessibility; (4) provide patient-centered care; (5) employ willing, qualified contraceptive providers; and (6) utilize peer educators.

Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging targeting 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) has been used to localize neuroinflammation. We aimed to use TSPO-PET imaging to evaluate neuroinflammation in PLWH.Design:Twenty-four virologically suppressed PLWH on combined antiretroviral therapy and 13 HIV-negative (HIV-) controls completed TSPO-PET imaging using the radiotracer [11C]PBR28. Because of tracer complexity and differing procedures used in previous studies, we employed an expansive methodological approach, using binding potential (BP) and standard uptake value ratio and multiple different reference regions to estimate [11C]PBR28 binding.Methods:[11C]PBR28 binding was measured in 30 cortical and subcortical regions and compared between PLWH and HIV- controls. Pearson correlation evaluated the association between [11C]PBR28 binding and cognition and clinical measures of HIV.Results:Analyses conducted using multiple reference regions and measures of tracer uptake revealed no significant differences between [11C]PBR28 binding in PLWH compared with HIV- controls.

Revisiting ecological dominance in arboreal ants: how dominant usage of nesting resources shapes community assembly,-,-,-,-,-,-,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00442-020-04748-z,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85090451906,"Community assembly, Ecological dominance, Interspecific competition, Niche differentiation, Resource specialization","Ecologically dominant species can shape the assembly of ecological communities via altering competitive outcomes. Moreover, these effects may be amplified under limited niche differentiation. Nevertheless, the influences of ecological dominance and niche differentiation on assembly are rarely considered together. Here, we provide a novel examination of dominance in a diverse arboreal ant community, defining dominance by the prevalent usage of nesting resources and addressing how it influences community assembly. We first used a series of quantitative observational and experimental studies to address the natural nesting ecology, colony incidence on surveyed trees, and level of dominance over newly available nesting resources by our focal species, Cephalotes pusillus. The experimental studies were then used further to examine whether C. pusillus shapes assembly via an influence on cavity usage by co-occurring species. C. pusillus was confirmed as a dominant user of cavity nesting resources, with highly generalized nesting ecology, occupying about 50% of the trees within the focal system, and accounting for more than a third of new cavity occupation in experiments. Our experiments showed further that the presence of C. pusillus was associated with modest effects on species richness, but significant decreases in cavity-occupation levels and significant shifts in the entrance-size usage by co-occurring species. These results indicate that C. pusillus, as a dominant user of nesting resources, shapes assembly at multiple levels. Broadly, our findings highlight that complex interactions between a dominant species and the resource-usage patterns of other species can underlie species assembly in diverse ecological communities.",,10.1007/s00442-020-04748-z,14321939,151,National Science Foundation,DEB 0842144,85090451906 (Scopus),00298549,1-2,163,2020-10-01,32909091.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00442-020-04748-z,Oecologia,194

The WSST with a time-varying parameter, called the adaptive WSST, was introduced very recently in the paper “Adaptive synchrosqueezing transform with a time-varying parameter for non-stationary signal separation.” The well-separated conditions of non-stationary multicomponent signals with the adaptive WSST and a method to select the time-varying parameter were proposed in that paper.

"Between predators and parasitoids: Complex interactions among shelter traits, predation and parasitism in a shelter-building caterpillar community",OA,-,-,Bronze OA,-,-,https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.13641,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85089564025,"Diptera, enemy-free space, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, neotropics, spiders","Shelter-building is widespread in the animal world and such shelters often influence the success of their builders. Shelters built by caterpillars influence the likelihood of attacks by natural enemies, but how particular shelter traits influence caterpillar survival is not known. Furthermore, the differential effects of certain shelter traits on some natural enemies, such as predators, may lead to ‘enemy-free space’ for other natural enemies (parasitoids). The parasitoid enemy-free space hypothesis has not been directly tested for shelter-building caterpillars. To understand how shelter traits influence caterpillar survival, shelter traits, predation and parasitism were measured simultaneously for 24 caterpillar morphospecies (1,465 caterpillars) in a tropical dry forest and analysed in a phylogenetic context. Shelter type, shelter openness and whether shelters accumulated frass had different amounts of phylogenetic signal, with frass accumulation displaying the most and shelter openness the least. All three traits affected the frequency with which caterpillar species experienced predation. Predation was elevated in two shelter types (leaf folds and leaf rolls) compared to cut-and-fold shelters. Combinations of shelter openness and frass accumulation also affected predation, with closed frass-free shelters having the lowest predation and closed frass-filled shelters having the highest. Parasitism was not affected by shelter traits but was strongly correlated with evolutionary history and negatively correlated with predation. These results confirm a trade-off between predation and parasitism and demonstrate that predation can be more frequent than parasitism. Different shelter types result in different amounts of predation. These defensive shelter traits and their effectiveness also vary phylogenetically. Together, our results suggest that predation and parasitism determine the success of shelter-building caterpillars, and that success is a function of the specific shelter they construct. More generally, our results demonstrate the importance of considering the effects of defensive traits on both predators and parasitoids when investigating interactions between herbivores and natural enemies.

In this study, we evaluated the potential of full-waveform lidar data for mapping tree species richness across the tropics by relating measurements of vertical canopy structure, as a proxy for the occupation of vertical niche space, to tree species richness. Location: Tropics. Time period: Present. Major taxa studied: Trees. Methods: First, we evaluated the characteristics of vertical canopy structure across 15 study sites using (simulated) large-footprint full-waveform lidar data (22 m diameter) and related these findings to in-situ tree species information. Then, we developed structure–richness models at the local (within 25–50 ha plots), regional (biogeographical regions) and pan-tropical scale at three spatial resolutions (1.0, 0.25 and 0.0625 ha) using Poisson regression. Results: The results showed a weak structure–richness relationship at the local scale. At the regional scale (within a biogeographical region) a stronger relationship between canopy structure and tree species richness across different tropical forest types was found, for example across Central Africa and in South America [R2 ranging from.44–.56, root mean squared difference as a percentage of the mean (RMSD%) ranging between 23–61%]. Modelling the relationship pan-tropically, across four continents, 39% of the variation in tree species richness could be explained with canopy structure alone (R2 =.39 and RMSD% = 43%, 0.25-ha resolution). Main conclusions: Our results may serve as a basis for the future development of a set of structure–richness models to map high resolution tree species richness using vertical canopy structure information from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI). The value of this effort would be enhanced by access to a larger set of field reference data for all tropical regions. Future research could also support the use of GEDI data in frameworks using environmental and spectral information for modelling tree species richness across the tropics.",,10.1111/geb.13158,14668238,1799,National Science Foundation,0939907,85088583362 (Scopus),1466822X,10,1816,2020-10-01,,https://doi.org/10.1111/geb.13158,Global Ecology and Biogeography,29

Using salary schedules from 490 school districts, the authors estimate the rate of return on contributions for each district. They then analyze the relationship between district characteristics and the rate of return.

To assess the potential associations between SBPs and treatment dropout more thoroughly, two definitions of attrition were utilized: (a) clinician-rated dropout and (b) whether the child received an adequate dose of treatment (i.e., 12 or more sessions). Whereas only 34.3% of the children completed treatment per their clinician, 69.4% received an adequate dose of treatment. In contrast to the study hypotheses, neither development-related nor sexual abuse–specific SBPs were associated with either clinician-rated dropout or adequate dose status, ORs = 0.99–1.00.

They currently comprise at least 18 species, distributed from polar to tropical environments in the Southern Hemisphere. The history of their diversification and adaptation to these diverse environments remains controversial. We used 22 new genomes from 18 penguin species to reconstruct the order, timing, and location of their diversification, to track changes in their thermal niches through time, and to test for associated adaptation across the genome. Our results indicate that the penguin crown-group originated during the Miocene in New Zealand and Australia, not in Antarctica as previously thought, and that Aptenodytes is the sister group to all other extant penguin species. We show that lineage diversification in penguins was largely driven by changing climatic conditions and by the opening of the Drake Passage and associated intensification of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). Penguin species have introgressed throughout much of their evolutionary history, following the direction of the ACC, which might have promoted dispersal and admixture. Changes in thermal niches were accompanied by adaptations in genes that govern thermoregulation and oxygen metabolism. Estimates of ancestral effective population sizes (Ne) confirm that penguins are sensitive to climate shifts, as represented by three different demographic trajectories in deeper time, themost common (in 11 of 18 penguin species) being an increased Nebetween 40 and 70 kya, followed by a precipitous decline during the Last Glacial Maximum.

Training programs have focused on overdose recognition and response without targeting core attitudinal change by covering addiction or harm reduction principles. Objectives: This study examined the impact of a comprehensive overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND) training on officers’ attitudes toward overdose victims, knowledge of and competence to respond to an opioid overdose, and concerns about using naloxone. The training included the common information about overdose recognition and response, with added components covering broader content about addiction and harm reduction principles and philosophies. Methods: A total of 787 (83% male) officers were administered surveys before and after attending a 2.5–3 hour comprehensive OEND training. Survey items measured overdose-related knowledge and attitudes, including attitudes about people who use drugs and who overdose. Results: Following the training, participants’ overdose-related knowledge and perceived competence to use naloxone improved. However, there were more nuanced changes in attitudes toward overdose victims: though 55.3% of officers reported more positive post-training attitudes, 31% reported more negative attitudes, and 13.7% reported no attitudinal change. Younger officers were most likely to report worsened attitudes. Improvements in attitudes toward overdose victims were associated with reductions in both naloxone-related concerns and risk compensation beliefs.

The purposes of this study were to understand the acceptability and feasibility of an online Mindfulness-Based Intervention (MBI) for YBCS and their partners (i.e., Couples Mindfulness-Based Intervention: C-MBI) and to compare the effectiveness of the C-MBI to a closely-matched control, an online MBI for individuals (I-MBI). Methods: YBCS and their partners were recruited. Couples were randomly assigned to an 8-week C-MBI (couples = 41) or to I-MBI (couples = 36), which included one-hour video modules, a manual, and guided-meditation audios. Both couple members participated in the C-MBI; only the YBCS participated in the control I-MBI. Participants answered surveys about individual- and couple-level functioning at baseline and post-intervention. Results: Online delivery was shown to be feasible and acceptable. For YBCS and their partners, levels of perceived stress, anxiety, depression, and fatigue were lower after the intervention, in both conditions. Unexpectedly, however, participating in the C-MBI appeared to have detrimental effects on dyadic adjustment and relationship quality. Conclusion: Although YBCS and their partners reported online delivery was acceptable and benefited well-being, for couple-based MBIs to have benefits for relationship functioning, it may be necessary for couples to have the support of other couples and an instructor. Online delivery may be particularly acceptable and effective for clinical populations, including YBCS.

We investigated the frequency and associations of suboptimal CD4 recovery after ART started during acute HIV infection (AHI). Methods: Participants who started ART in Fiebig I to V AHI with ≥48 weeks of continuous documented HIV-RNA < 50 copies/mL were stratified by CD4 count at latest study visit to suboptimal immune recovery (SIR; CD4 < 350 cells/mm3), intermediate immune recovery (IIR; 350 ≤ CD4 < 500) and complete immune recovery (CIR; CD4 ≥ 500). Clinical and laboratory parameters were assessed at pre-ART baseline and latest study visit. Additional inflammatory and neurobehavioral endpoints were examined at baseline and 96 weeks. Results: Of 304 participants (96% male, median 26 years old) evaluated after median 144 (range 60 to 420) weeks of ART initiated at median 19 days (range 1 to 62) post-exposure, 3.6% (n = 11) had SIR and 14.5% (n = 44) had IIR.

Previous studies have given conflicting results regarding the significance of pollination mode, seed dispersal mode, mating system, growth form and latitudinal region in shaping patterns of genetic structure, as estimated by FST values, and no study to date has tested their relative importance together across a broad scale. Here, we assembled a 337-species data set for seed plants from publications with data on FST from nuclear markers and species traits, including variables pertaining to the sampling scheme of each study. We used species traits, while accounting for sampling variables, to perform phylogenetic multiple regressions. Results demonstrated that FST values were higher for tropical, mixed-mating, non-woody species pollinated by small insects, indicating greater population differentiation, and lower for temperate, outcrossing trees pollinated by wind. Among the factors we tested, latitudinal region explained the largest portion of variance, followed by pollination mode, mating system and growth form, while seed dispersal mode did not significantly relate to FST. Our analyses provide the most robust and comprehensive evaluation to date of the main ecological factors predicted to drive population differentiation in seed plants, with important implications for understanding the basis of their genetic divergence.

While reports of ontogenetic variation in plant defences are commonplace, no study to date has tested for ontogenetic shifts in defence syndromes, and we know little about the ecological and evolutionary drivers of variation in plant defence syndromes across ontogeny. We tested for ontogenetic variation in plant defence syndromes by measuring a suite of defensive and nutritional traits on saplings and adult trees of 29 oak (Quercus, Fagaceae) species distributed across Europe, North America, and Asia. In addition, we investigated if these syndromes exhibited a phylogenetic signal to elucidate the nature of their macro-evolutionary variation, whether they were associated with levels of herbivore pressure and climatic conditions, and if any such evolutionary and ecological patterns were contingent on ontogeny. Our analyses revealed three distinct oak defence syndromes: the first included species with high defences, the second species with high defences and low nutrient levels, and the third species with high nutrients and thinner leaves. Interestingly, these defence syndromes remained virtually unchanged across the two ontogenetic stages sampled. In addition, our analyses indicated no evidence for a phylogenetic signal in oak syndromes, a result consistent across ontogenetic stages. Finally, with respect to ecological factors, we found no effect of climatic conditions on defences for either ontogenetic stage, whereas defence syndromes were associated with differing levels of herbivory in adults but not saplings suggesting an association between herbivore pressure and syndrome type that is contingent on ontogeny. Synthesis. Together, these findings indicate that defence syndromes remain remarkably consistent across oak ontogenetic stages, are evolutionarily labile, and while they appear unrelated to climate, they do appear to be associated with herbivory levels in an ontogenetic-dependent manner.

Lipids also have crucial roles in plant adaptions to abiotic stresses. The aim of this study was to use glycerolipidomic and transcriptomic analyses to determine the changes in lipids induced by Mo that are associated with Mo-enhanced drought tolerance in wheat. Mo treatments increased the transcript levels of genes involved in fatty acid and glycerolipid biosynthesis and desaturation, but suppressed the expression of genes involved in oxylipin production. Wheat plants supplemented with Mo displayed higher contents of monogalactosyldiacyglycerol (MGDG), digalactosyldoacylglycerol (DGDG), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidylcholine (PC) with increased levels of unsaturation. The levels of MGDG, DGDG, PG, and PC increased under PEG-simulated drought (PSD), and the magnitude of the responses varied in the presence and absence of Mo. Mo increased the accumulation of the most abundant glycerolipid species of C36:6, C34:4, and C34:3 by increasing the expression of genes related to desaturation under PSD, and this contributed to maintaining the fluidity of membranes. In addition, Mo attenuated the decreases in the ratios of DGDG/MGDG and PC/PE that were observed under PSD. These changes in lipids in Mo-treated wheat would contribute to maintaining the integrity of membranes and to protecting the photosynthetic apparatus, thus acting together to enhance drought tolerance.",,10.1093/jxb/eraa215,14602431,5074,National Natural Science Foundation of China,41771329,85091444892 (Scopus),00220957,16,5086,2020-08-01,,https://doi.org/10.1093/jxb/eraa215,Journal of Experimental Botany,71

We collected growth data and generated unbiased mass and tarsus growth rate estimates (mass n = 92 species, tarsus n = 49 species), and measured incubation period (n = 151) and nestling period (n = 153), which we analyzed with respect to region, egg mass, adult mass, clutch size, parental care type, nest type, daily nest predation rate (DMR), and nest height. We investigated covariation of life-history and natural-history attributes with the four development traits after controlling for phylogeny. Species in our lowland tropical sample grew 20% (incubation period), 25% (mass growth rate), and 26% (tarsus growth rate) more slowly than in our temperate sample. Nestling period did not vary with respect to latitude, which suggests that tropical songbirds fledge in a less well-developed state than temperate species. Suboscine species typically exhibited slower embryonic and post-embryonic growth than oscine passerines regardless of their breeding region. This pattern of slow development in tropical species could reflect phylogenetic effects based on unknown physiological attributes. Time-dependent nest mortality was unrelated to nestling mass growth rate, tarsus growth rate, and incubation period, but was significantly associated with nestling period. This suggests that nest predation, the predominant cause of nest loss in songbirds, does not exert strong selection on physiologically constrained traits, such as embryonic and post-embryonic growth, among our samples of temperate and lowland tropical songbird species. Nestling period, which is evolutionarily more labile than growth rate, was significantly shorter in birds exposed to higher rates of nest loss and nesting at lower heights, among other traits. Differences in life-history variation across latitudes provide insight into how unique ecological characteristics of each region influence physiological processes of passerines, and thus, how they can shape the evolution of life histories. While development traits clearly vary with respect to latitude, trait distributions overlap broadly. Life-history and natural history associations differ for each development trait, which suggests that unique selective pressures or constraints influence the evolution of each trait.",e0233627,10.1371/journal.pone.0233627,19326203,,National Science Foundation,0212587,85089555871 (Scopus),,8 August,,2020-08-01,32804928.0,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0233627,PLoS ONE,15

Then we investigated whether social anxiety is associated with attention bias. Furthermore, we investigated the neural basis of this association. Finally, longitudinal data was used to test if these biomarkers could predict social anxiety. The results indicated that social anxiety is positively associated with the grey matter volume (GMV) of orbital-frontal cortex (OFC), and the functional connectivity (FC) of OFC-amygdala.

The objective of this study was to identify the combination of risk features that distinguish frail from nonfrail individuals.Setting:Machine learning analysis of highly dimensional risk features was performed on a clinical cohort of PLWH.Methods:Participants included 105 older (average age = 55.6) PLWH, with at least a 3-month history of combination antiretroviral therapy (median CD4 = 546). Predictors included demographics, HIV clinical markers, comorbid health conditions, cognition, and neuroimaging (ie, volumetrics, resting-state functional connectivity, and cerebral blood flow). Gradient-boosted multivariate regressions were implemented to establish linear and interactive classification models. Model performance was determined by sensitivity/specificity (F1 score) with 5-fold cross validation.Results:The linear gradient-boosted multivariate regression classifier included lower current CD4 count, lower psychomotor performance, and multiple neuroimaging indices (volumes, network connectivity, and blood flow) in visual and motor brain systems (F1 score = 71%; precision = 84%; and sensitivity = 66%). The interactive model identified novel synergies between neuroimaging features, female sex, symptoms of depression, and current CD4 count.Conclusions:Data-driven algorithms built from highly dimensional clinical and brain imaging features implicate disruption to the visuomotor system in older PLWH designated as frail individuals.

Investigation of the lipidomic and carbohydrate profiles with the transcriptome of developing nodules revealed highly activated glycolysis, fatty acid (FA), 2-monoacylglycerol (2-MAG), and membrane lipid biosynthesis and transport during nodule development. RNA-sequence profiling of metabolic genes in roots and developing nodules highlighted the enhanced expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis and transport of FAs, membrane lipids, and 2-MAG in rhizobia-soybean symbioses via the RAML-WRI-FatM-GPAT-STRL pathway, which is similar to that in legume-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi symbiosis. The essential roles of the metabolic pathway during soybean nodulation were further supported by analysis of transgenic hairy roots overexpressing soybean GmWRI1b-OE and GmLEC2a-OE. GmLEC2a-OE hairy roots produced fewer nodules, in contrast to GmWRI1b-OE hairy roots. GmLEC2a-OE hairy roots displayed different or even opposite expression patterns of the genes involved in glycolysis and the synthesis of FAs, 2-MAG, TAG, and membrane lipids compared to GmWRI1b-OE hairy roots. Glycolysis, FA and membrane lipid biosynthesis were repressed in GmLEC2a-OE but increased in GmWRI1b-OE hairy roots, which may account for the reduced nodulation in GmLEC2a-OE hairy roots but increased nodulation in GmWRI1b-OE hairy roots.

Much of this research has comprised composite scores of perceived rewards and risks of multiple, often disparate, crime types that are then used to predict “general” offending behavior. Although the results of such prior tests are informative, we believe that this tendency has resulted in two shortcomings. First, a central component of mathematical rational choice theory is overlooked, namely, that responsivity to incentives will be crime specific. That is, offenders should prefer crime types that subjectively offer greater rewards and fewer risks relative to other crimes. Second, individual differences in offending specialization are not addressed, of which Clarke and Cornish (1985) and Shover (1996) argued rational choice theories are well suited to explain. Using a sample of serious offenders, we find that in a given time period, individuals are more likely to engage in crime types they viewed as more intrinsically rewarding and less risky compared with other crimes. Furthermore, individuals displayed greater specialization in violence to the extent they view violence as more rewarding and less risky than property offenses.",,10.1111/1745-9125.12243,17459125,485,,,85083255943 (Scopus),00111384,3,509,2020-08-01,,https://doi.org/10.1111/1745-9125.12243,Criminology,58

In the current study, we explored the moderating role of DLPFC between rumination and depressed mood. We used the think/no-think paradigm to explore the brain mechanisms of memory inhibition, and subsequently investigated the moderation effect of areas of interest, related with the memory inhibition, on the relationship between rumination and depressed mood.

These tags attach with high efficiency to the analytes, increase the signal, and result in the formation of multiply-charged cations. We illustrate the present approach with citrate and isocitrate, which are isomeric metabolites each containing three carboxylic acid groups. We observe a 20-fold increase in signal-to-noise for citrate and an 8-fold increase for isocitrate as compared to detection of the untagged analytes in negative mode. Collision-induced dissociation of the triply tagged, triply charged analytes results in distinct tandem mass spectra. The phenylene spacer groups limit proton mobility and enable access to structurally informative C-C bond cleavage reactions. Modeling of the gas-phase structures and dissociation chemistry of these triply charged analyte ions highlights the importance of hydroxyl proton mobilization in this low proton mobility environment. Tandem mass spectrometric analyses of deuterated congeners and MS3 spectra are consistent with the proposed fragment ion structures and mechanisms of formation.

As a result, traditional notions of success may limit our understanding of the mechanisms that lead to differential transitional and adaptation pathways among today's children of immigrants. This study explores the definitions of success among a sample of Bosnian-origin youth in St. Louis. Method: The analysis is based on the first wave of in-depth qualitative interviews with 58 Bosnian second-generation youth (age 15–23) in St. Louis. Interviews lasted 45–90 min, were conducted in English, transcribed and coded following an inductive analytic logic. Results: Overall the respondents complemented traditional notions of success, such as material stability and family formation with more subjective indicators such as self-fulfillment and happiness. Conclusions: The findings highlight the importance for future waves of data collection to trace how definitions of success evolve and how they shape particular trajectories of the youth in our study. On a more general level, these findings urge researchers to incorporate definitions of success that are not primarily based on social and economic status mobility in an effort to generate a more nuanced understanding of the adaptations and transitions to adulthood of today's children of immigrants.",,10.1016/j.adolescence.2020.05.005,10959254,11,University of Missouri,,85085468925 (Scopus),01401971,,18,2020-07-01,32474219.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adolescence.2020.05.005,Journal of Adolescence,82

Understanding how hospitals can continue providing services in an effective manner under these circumstances is thus important. In this study, we investigate how information technology (IT) helped hospitals in mainland China better respond to the outbreak of the pandemic. Materials and Methods: We conducted a content analysis of pages published on the websites of the top 50 hospitals in mainland China between January 22 and February 21, 2020. In total, we analyzed 368 pages that the hospitals published during the initial days of the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose was to identify common themes related to the utilization of IT by these hospitals in response to the pandemic's outbreak. Results: We identified 5 focal themes across the webpages published by the hospitals during our study period, including (1) popular medical science education, (2) digitalized hospital processes, (3) knowledge management for medical professionals, (4) telemedicine, and (5) new IT initiatives for healthcare services. Our analysis revealed that Chinese hospitals spent greater effort in promoting popular medical science education in the initial stages of our study period and more on telemedicine in the latter stages.

The nonlethal collapse of a flowering stalk, for example, can greatly reduce plant fitness if it leads to ‘incorrect’ floral orientation and thus reduced visitation or poor pollination. When floral orientation is important for accurate pollination, as has been suggested for bilaterally symmetrical flowers, we predict that such flowers should have developmental and/or behavioural mechanisms for restoring ‘correct’ orientation after accidents. We made observations and conducted experiments on 23 native and cultivated flowering plant species in Australia, South America, North America and Europe. We found that flowers with bilateral symmetry usually have the capacity to reorient after accidents, and that this is manifested through rapid bending and/or rotation of pedicels or sexual organs or slower peduncle bending. Floral reorientation restores pollination accuracy and fit with pollinators. However, experimental floral misorientation in eight species with radially symmetrical flowers showed that, with one exception, they had little capacity to reorient their flowers, in line with expectations that the orientation of radially symmetrical flowers does not substantially affect pollination accuracy. Our results suggest that quick corrective reorientation of bilaterally symmetrical flowers is adaptive, highlighting a little-studied aspect of plant–pollinator interactions and plant evolution.",,10.1111/nph.16482,14698137,232,National Geographic Society,,85083064089 (Scopus),0028646X,1,243,2020-07-01,32252125.0,https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.16482,New Phytologist,227

However, the association between healthcare system inputs and patient-reported outcomes remains unclear. Hence, we explored the predictive value of human resources and infrastructures of the countries' healthcare system on patient-reported outcomes in adults with congenital heart disease. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 3588 patients with congenital heart disease (median age = 31y; IQR = 16.0; 52% women; 26% simple, 49% moderate, and 25% complex defects) from 15 countries. The following patient-reported outcomes were measured: Perceived physical and mental health, psychological distress, health behaviors, and quality of life. The assessed inputs of the healthcare system were: (i) human resources (i.e., density of physicians and nurses, both per 1000 people) and (ii) infrastructure (i.e., density of hospital beds per 10,000 people). Univariable, multivariable, and sensitivity analyses using general linear mixed models were conducted, adjusting for patient-specific variables and unmeasured country differences. Results: Sensitivity analyses showed that higher density of physicians was significantly associated with better self-reported physical and mental health, less psychological distress, and better quality of life. A greater number of nurses was significantly associated with better self-reported physical health, less psychological distress, and less risky health behavior. No associations between a higher density of hospital beds and patient-reported outcomes were observed. Conclusions: This explorative study suggests that density of human resources for health, measured on country level, are associated with patient-reported outcomes in adults with congenital heart disease. More research needs to be conducted before firm conclusions about the relationships observed can be drawn. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02150603.

To avoid double taxation, they permit tax cross-crediting, i.e., a global firm can use excess foreign tax credits (the portion of foreign tax payments that exceed its home country tax liabilities) generated from a subsidiary (located in a high-tax country) to offset the tax obligations from another subsidiary (located in a low-tax country). This article studies a multinational firm’s global sourcing decisions at two subsidiaries located in low- and high-tax countries, respectively, with an objective of maximizing its expected worldwide after-tax profit. We characterize the optimal sourcing decisions under various decentralized and centralized after-tax profit-maximizing performance measures. We show that the global firm can devise an easily implementable incentive scheme to optimally coordinate the decentralized sourcing decisions made at the two subsidiaries. We also demonstrate that decentralized policies with after-tax performance measures are more advantageous than the traditional pretax policies when the “tax effects”, i.e., the impacts of certain features of the tax laws (such as tax cross-crediting) on supply chain decisions, are significant.",,10.1080/24725854.2019.1670370,24725862,688,,,85076563414 (Scopus),24725854,6,702,2020-06-02,,https://doi.org/10.1080/24725854.2019.1670370,IISE Transactions,52

This influence of color purity on a color’s perceived brightness is a well-established phenomenon known as the Helmholtz–Kohlrausch (H-K) effect. We investigated gender differences in the H-K effect by measuring brightness (via direct brightness matching [DBM]) and luminance (via heterochromatic flicker photometry [HFP]) at five wavelengths (450, 520, 560, 580, and 650 nm) perceived as blue, green, green-yellow, yellow, and red hues. We compared DBM/HFP ratios between 13 males and 18 females. Based on previous evidence of a female advantage in chromatic processes, we hypothesized that DBM/HFP ratios would be higher in female subjects. While HFP measures were essentially the same between male and female subjects, DBM measures and DBM/HFP ratios were significantly higher for female subjects than males.

The literature shows that distress can influence insulin sensitivity and contribute to the development of T2DM; however, much of the literature fails to acknowledge the influence of distress in collaboration with GRD, obesity, and advancing age. Method: As part of creating the current framework, an earlier version of the conceptual framework was used for a pilot study. An integrative review was conducted to examine the relationships among GRD, obesity (as a response to weight management), advancing age, distress, and coping (as a response to distress) to further refine the conceptual framework. Theoretical and empirical studies were examined to define distress, describe the nature and impact of the stress response, and determine how distress interacts with GRD, obesity, and advancing age.

There was no evidence of emotional modulation of the N400 old/new effect, which suggests that the sense of familiarity was not affected by fearful facial expressions. The LPC old/new effect, however, was modulated by facial expression, as it was absent for fearful faces because of a greater positivity in response to new fearful than new neutral faces. This LPC old/new effect finding may reflect that the emotional salience of fearful new faces is mistaken for a sense of recollection, resulting in an increased false alarm rate.

Generalist herbivores are often widespread and occur in a variety of environments. Due to their broad distribution, it is likely that some populations of generalists will encounter host plants with geographic variation in traits that could affect the herbivore's growth and survival (i.e. performance). However, the geographic pattern of performance has rarely been studied for generalists, especially across large geographic ranges. 2. This study used one of the most generalist herbivore species known, the fall webworm (Hyphantria cunea Drury 1773, Erebidae, Lepidoptera), to experimentally test how the performance of a local population of fall webworms varies with increasing geographic distance of the host plant population from the local herbivore population. Specifically, a transplant experiment was used to compare the performance of one fall webworm population feeding on its local host plants with its performance on host populations from two other locations, 1300 and 2600 km away. 3. It was found that fall webworms performed better on their local host plant populations than on populations from other regions, with performance at its lowest when reared on hosts of the same species from the farthest region. It was also found that local fall webworms do not perform well on hosts commonly used by fall webworms at the other two, more distant sites. 4.

Multidomain proteins can be challenging for protein structure modeling, particularly those for which templates can be found for individual domains but not for the entire sequence. In such cases, homology modeling can generate high quality models of the domains but not for the orientations between domains. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) reports the structural properties of entire proteins and has the potential for guiding homology modeling of multidomain proteins. In this article, we describe a novel multidomain protein assembly modeling method, SAXSDom that integrates experimental knowledge from SAXS with probabilistic Input-Output Hidden Markov model to assemble the structures of individual domains together. Four SAXS-based scoring functions were developed and tested, and the method was evaluated on multidomain proteins from two public datasets.

In order to decrease gender dysphoria and overcome discrimination, trans women affirm their gender through social and medical transition, often in contexts of economic hardship and sexual risk. This study qualitatively examined how gender-affirming behaviors enhance or diminish vulnerability to HIV in light of structural and economic barriers to gender transition. Methods: We conducted individual interviews with 19 adult trans women in two U.S. cities (Richmond, VA and St. Louis, MO) who reported one or more sexual risk behaviors and recent economic hardship related to employment/income, housing, or food security. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic content analysis. Results: The majority (74%) of trans women were racial/ethnic minorities with mean age of 26.3 years. Gender-affirming behaviors varied with 58% of trans women having legally changed their name and gender marker; 79% having initiated hormone therapy; and 11% having not initiated any medical or legal changes. None had undertaken surgical changes. Findings suggested that the process of gender transitioning resulted in both increasing and decreasing HIV risk. The high need for gender affirmation by male sex partners contributed to trans women's exposure to sexual objectification, sexual risk behaviors, and conflicting interests in HIV prevention messaging. Loss of housing and employment due to transition along with the high costs of transition products and medical visits increased reliance on sex work and created new obstacles in accessing HIV services. Trans women experienced lower HIV risk as they acquired legal and medical transition services, reshaped interactions with sex partners, and received gender-affirming support by others, including health providers, employers, peers, and housing professionals. Sexual abstinence was viewed as a negative consequence of incomplete transition, although characterized as a period of low HIV risk. Conclusions: Structural and policy initiatives that promote safe gender transition and economic stability in trans women may play a critical role in reducing HIV in this population. Addressing the harmful pressures for U.S. trans women to conform to perceived feminine stereotypes may also serve an important role.",782,10.1186/s12889-020-08902-3,14712458,,National Institute of Mental Health,K01MH107310,85085436886 (Scopus),,1,,2020-05-26,32456674.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-08902-3,BMC Public Health,20

Together, these practices constitute an intervention technology for PSTs. After content validation, completion of the 25-item measure by PST members in four states from the Midwest United States yielded a five-factor solution via exploratory analysis, and subsequent parallel analysis reduced the solution to three factors: social validity, knowledge of interventions and intervention integrity, and follow up with problem identifiers. These subscales consistently differentiated PSTs with high meeting integrity, defined as use of a timekeeper and agenda, from those with lower meeting integrity.

The purpose of this case study was to explore preservice English teachers’ reading identities and their perceptions of reading identity development in the context of English classrooms. Design/methodology/approach: This study used qualitative collective case design. Data sources included analogy exercise about participants’ reading identities, participant-generated observations of reading identity instruction, questionnaire on reading identity, class discussions about reading identity and final written reflection. Findings: Data showed examples of participants’ reading identities as taking a variety of forms, but when discussing what shaped their reading identities, the strongest codes related to positive interactions with people and texts. The data showed that participants related positive reading identities to both reading to learn and reading for pleasure. More participants’ perceived their professional identity as that of a literature teacher than a reading teacher. Research limitations/implications: Future research is needed on how to support preservice teachers’ positive reading identities in English education courses. Practical implications: Our data suggest that learning about reading identity may help preservice English teachers think of reading as something that is developing in themselves as well as their students over a lifetime. By providing space in English methods programs to attend to preservice teachers’ reading lives, we can help them rekindle or find their love of reading.

Persistent inquiries in this work include whether there is a set of ideal psychological and emotional factors that are required to achieve optimal performance and, if there are, what are they and how are they related to optimal performance. To answer these questions, the current study aimed to identify potential profiles of personality and emotional traits based on a sample of professional Taekwondo athletes from China. In addition, the study also aimed to examine the utility of the profiles in predicting successful athlete performance. Using multidimensional scaling (MDS) profile analysis, two latent profiles of personality and emotional traits were identified that indicate four subtypes of athletes. Regression analyses were conducted to examine how the identified profiles were associated with performance success. The results seemed to suggest that Taekwondo athletes with more performance success were more likely to have a profile of positive personality and emotional traits, while athletes with less performance success were likely to have somewhat elevated levels of self-control, extraversion, and aggression. Knowledge of athletes’ personality profiles will help sport psychologists develop suitable interventions to enhance athletes’ performance success.

Methods: Linear probability modeling is used to test the framework's utility and whether complaint, neighborhood, and police district characteristics affect the clearance of violent crimes in St. Louis, MO. Results: The findings suggest that while minority victims and neighborhoods may be devalued, specific crime features physically hinder crime-solving. Important interactions emerge between devaluation and solvability indicators, and crime types are found to have distinctive clearance predictors.

The spontaneous alternation of perception might indicate a connection between bistable perception and the dynamic interaction of brain networks. Here, we hypothesized that individual differences in perceptual dynamics may be reflected in dynamics of spontaneous neural activities. To test this idea, we investigated the relationship between the percept duration and the reconfiguration patterns of dynamic brain networks as measured by the functional connectivity (FC) during the resting state. Firstly, we found that individual difference of percept duration is associated with the temporal variability of the brain regions which were previously reported in studies of bistable perception, including anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), superior parietal lobule (SPL), inferior parietal lobule (IPL), precuneus, insula, and V5. Secondly, there is a positive relationship between the temporal variability within the frontal-parietal network (FPN) and the percept duration.

Because lineages with seasonal transmission strategies are unlikely to produce gametocytes in winter, we predicted that (1) resident birds living within wintering areas of Neotropical migrants would unlikely be infected with North American parasite lineages; and (2) if infected, wintering migratory birds would be more likely to harbor Plasmodium spp. rather than Parahaemoproteus spp. or Haemoproteus spp. parasites in their bloodstreams, as only Plasmodium produces life stages, other than gametocytes, that infect red blood cells. To test these predictions, we used molecular detection and microscopy to compare the diversity and prevalence of haemosporidian parasites among year-round residents and wintering migratory birds during February 2016, on three islands of The Bahamas archipelago, i.e., Andros, Grand Bahama, and Great Abaco. Infection prevalence was low and comparable between migratory (15/111) and resident (15/129) individuals, and it did not differ significantly among islands. Out of the 12 lineages detected infecting migratory birds, five were transmitted in North America; four lineages could have been transmitted during breeding, wintering, or migration; and three lineages were likely transmitted in The Bahamas. Resident birds mostly carried lineages endemic to the Caribbean region. All North American–transmitted parasite lineages detected among migratory birds were Plasmodium spp. Our findings suggest that haemosporidian parasites of migrants shift resource allocation seasonally, minimizing the production of gametocytes during winter, with low risk of infection spillover to resident birds.",,10.1007/s00436-020-06646-y,14321955,1563,National Science Foundation,0954891,85083178953 (Scopus),09320113,5,1572,2020-05-01,32246260.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00436-020-06646-y,Parasitology Research,119

NPC6 is associated with the chloroplasts and microsomal membranes, and hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine and galactolipids to produce diacylglycerol. Knockout and overexpression of NPC6 decreased and increased, respectively, the flux of fatty acids from phospholipids and galactolipids into triacylglycerol production. Candidate-gene association study in oilseed rape indicates that only BnNPC6.C01 of the four homeologues NPC6s is associated with seed oil content and yield. Haplotypic analysis indicates that the BnNPC6.C01 favorable haplotype can increase both seed oil content and seed yield. These results indicate that NPC6 promotes membrane glycerolipid turnover to accumulate TAG production in oil seeds and that NPC6 has a great application potential for oil yield improvement.",,10.1111/nph.16473,14698137,1055,National Science Foundation,2015CB150204,85081745153 (Scopus),0028646X,4,1073,2020-05-01,32176333.0,https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.16473,New Phytologist,226

However, little is known about their impact on patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess and compare PROs in adults with CHD with and without ICDs. Methods: A propensity-based matching weight analysis was conducted to evaluate PROs in an international cross-sectional study of adults with CHD from 15 countries across 5 continents. Results: A total of 3188 patients were included: 107 with ICDs and 3081 weight-matched controls without ICDs. ICD recipients were an average age of 40.1 ± 12.4 years, and >95% had moderate or complex CHD. Defibrillators were implanted for primary and secondary prevention in 38.3% and 61.7%, respectively. Perceived health status, psychological distress, sense of coherence, and health behaviors did not differ significantly among patients with and without ICDs. However, ICD recipients had a more threatening view of their illness (relative % difference 8.56; P = .011). Those with secondary compared to primary prevention indications had a significantly lower quality-of-life score (Linear Analogue Scale 72.0 ± 23.1 vs 79.2 ± 13.0; P = .047). Marked geographic variations were observed. Overall sense of well-being, assessed by a summary score that combines various PROs, was significantly lower in ICD recipients (vs controls) from Switzerland, Argentina, Taiwan, and the United States.

However, the effect that water stress has on these two functional pools, especially when imposed during the crucial seed setting stage is unclear. To better understand these effects, we exposed Arabidopsis plants at the seed setting stage to a range of water limitation and water deprivation conditions and then evaluated physiological, metabolic, and proteomic parameters, with special focus on FAAs and PBAAs. We found that in response to severe water limitation, seed yield decreased, while seed weight, FAA, and PBAA content per seed increased. Nevertheless, the composition of FAAs and PBAAs remained unaltered. In response to severe water deprivation, however, both seed yield and weight were reduced. In addition, major alterations were observed in both FAA and proteome compositions, which indicated that both osmotic adjustment and proteomic reprogramming occurred in these naturally desiccation-tolerant organs. However, despite the major proteomic alteration, the PBAA composition did not change, suggesting that the proteomic reprogramming was followed by a proteomic rebalancing. Proteomic rebalancing has not been observed previously in response to stress, but its occurrence under stress strongly suggests its natural function. Together, our data show that the dry seed PBAA composition plays a key role in seed fitness and therefore is rigorously maintained even under severe water stress, while the FAA composition is more plastic and adaptable to changing environments, and that both functional pools are distinctly regulated.",,10.1111/tpj.14668,1365313X,838,National Science Foundation,1355406,85079072948 (Scopus),09607412,4,855,2020-05-01,31901179.0,https://doi.org/10.1111/tpj.14668,Plant Journal,102

This is true for the Cerrado, the most biodiverse tropical savanna in the world, which has experienced profound biodiversity loss. Previous studies have focused on a single metric (species composition), neglecting the fact that ‘species’ within the biome are often composed of cryptic species. In order to identify biodiversity hotspots more robustly and across multiple dimensions we integrate functional, spatial and new phylogeographic data for the Cerrado lizard fauna by (a) mapping the spatial patterns of species and phylogenetic diversity; and (b) using endemism measures to identify areas of unique diversity. We then quantify the extent to which existing protected areas represent the diversity. Location: Brazilian savanna (Cerrado). Methods: We generated species distribution models using distribution records for all Cerrado lizard species. These, combined with mitochondrial DNA phylogenies and natural history data, allowed us to map species richness, phylogenetic and functional diversity and phylogenetic and weighted endemism. Phylogenetic endemism maps were then cross-referenced against protected areas to calculate the amount of evolutionary history preserved within these areas. Results: The central region of the Cerrado, a vast and climatically stable plateau, stands out as important under all biodiversity metrics. Including evolutionary relationships in biodiversity assessment, we detected four regional hotspots with high concentration of spatially restricted evolutionary diversity. Protected areas cover only 10% of the Cerrado area and hold 11.64% of the summed phylogenetic endemism of all lizards in the biome. Main Conclusions: We highlighted both stable (Chapada dos Veadeiros and Serra do Espinhaço plateaus) and environmentally heterogenous regions (Araguaia and Tocantins valleys) as hotspots of evolutionary diversity. The creation and/or manipulation of areas for conservation are essential for the conservation and survival of the rich and endemic lizard fauna of the Cerrado.",,10.1111/jbi.13800,13652699,1130,National Science Foundation,062.00665/2015,85078664414 (Scopus),03050270,5,1142,2020-05-01,,https://doi.org/10.1111/jbi.13800,Journal of Biogeography,47

It deals with separating objects of interest from their background. Image-related low-level features are used to detect salient objects from images, however these features vary from image to image. There is no single feature that can clearly identify salient objects in all the images. Rather, a linear combination of these features may be useful for detection of salient objects. The computation of optimal weights of these features in a learning algorithm is an NP-Hard problem and requires an approximation of an optimization problem. So in the first phase, three low-level features capturing the edge and color information are extracted from the image. In the second phase, these features are integrated to form the saliency map. The linear weights are used for the combination which guides the dominance of feature(s). Thereafter, a threshold is applied over the saliency map to extract the salient objects. We use a linear weight vector and threshold that play a vital role in increasing the detection accuracy of the model. Identification of these parameters can be mapped to an optimization problem to identify the optimal linear weights best suited for the image. The problem is solved using an improved environmental adaptation method. There are three contributions of the paper. First being the identification of weight vector so that important feature(s) for an image are selected where the salient object is highlighted. The second is posing the salient object detection as an optimization problem with a relevant fitness function. Finally the third is utilization of Environment Adaptation Method (EAM) to solve the optimization problem pointed in the paper. The model is extensively validated over six complex datasets and achieves good results on standard performance measures used in comparison to twenty six related works.

Anderson (1999), in his street code thesis, in particular, argued that adherence to the street code functions as a signal that reduces violent victimization risk. Other research findings, however, reveal that the street code leads to an increase in victimization risk; moreover, violent offenders are routinely victimized at high rates given their lifestyle and routine activities. The evidence, therefore, does not show support for the position that a reputation for toughness or aggression effectively reduces violent victimization.

One hundred seventy-two children aged 6–18 (M = 10.53, SD = 3.36; 64% female, 64% Black) and their caregivers were included in the study. Two operational definitions of attrition were utilized: (1) clinician-rated dropout and (2) whether the child received an adequate dose of treatment (i.e., 12 or more sessions). Rates of clinician-rated attrition were high (76.2%); however, 73.8% received an adequate dose.

Victims of HT face atrocious abuses that negatively impact their health outcomes. When a state lacks protective laws, such as Safe Harbor laws, victims of HT tend to be seen as criminals. This paper aims to highlight the legal present gaps within Missouri’s anti-trafficking legislation and delineates recommendations for the legal protection of victims of HT and betterment of services needed for their reintegration and healing. Design/methodology/approach: This case-study is based on a policy analysis of current Missouri’s HT laws. This analysis was conducted through examining current rankings systems created by nationally and internationally recognized non-governmental organizations as well as governmental reports. Additionally, other state’s best practice and law passage of Safe Harbor legislations were examined. The recommendations were based on human rights and public health frameworks. Findings: Missouri is a state that has yet to upgrade its laws lately to reflect Safe Harbor laws. Constant upgrades and evaluations of current efforts are necessary to protect and address HT at the state and local levels. Public health and human rights principles can assist in the upgrading of current laws as well as other states’ best-practice and integration of protective legislation and diversion programs to both youth and adult victims of HT. Research limitations/implications: Laws are continually being updated at the state level; therefore, there might be some upgrades that have taken place after the analysis of this case study was conducted. Also, the findings and recommendations of this case study are limited to countries that are similar to the USA in terms of the state-level autonomy to pass laws independently from federal law. Practical implications: If Safe Harbor laws are well designed, they have greater potential to protect, support and assist victims of HT in their process from victimization into survivorship as well as to paving the way for societal reintegration. The creation and enforcement of Safe Harbor laws is a way to ensure the decriminalization process. Additionally, this legal protection also ensures that the universal human rights of victims are protected. Consequently, these legal processes and updates could assist in creating healthier communities in the long run in the USA and around the world. Social implications: From a public health and human rights perspectives, communities in the USA and around the world cannot provide complete protection to victims of HT until their anti-trafficking laws reflect Safe Harbor laws.

The purpose of this paper is to draw on social exchange theory arguments to investigate the direct and indirect effects of internal and external CSR practices on employee organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) and intention to quit. Design/methodology/approach: An empirical study was conducted among 664 employees working in the banking sector in Kuwait. Structural equation modeling techniques were used to test the suggested hypotheses. Findings: The results reveal that both internal and external CSR activities are positively related to OCB and OCB is negatively associated with intention to quit. Results also show that distributive justice moderates the relationship between OCB and intention to quit. Practical implications: These findings extend the literature on CSR and demonstrate that organizations engaged in CSR activities (internal and external) can enhance citizenship behaviors among employees and thereby increase retention rates. Originality/value: This research demonstrates the importance of CSR activities in tax-free countries, particularly, in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. Since employees in GCC countries are increasingly concerned about the CSR behaviors of organizations, CSR activities can allow local organizations to signal that they are good corporate citizens. Hence, CSR could be considered as a particularly critical source of competitive advantage for businesses in the region.",,10.1108/IJPPM-02-2019-0087,,447,,,85076903256 (Scopus),17410401,3,465,2020-04-09,,https://doi.org/10.1108/IJPPM-02-2019-0087,International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management,69

Our findings do not show that for-profit healthcare providers are universally more technically efficient than nonprofit healthcare facilities. However, for-profit nursing homes are more technically efficient than nonprofit facilities, while there was no difference between nonprofits and for-profits in hospitals.

However, concerns that people who use drugs will engage in riskier drug behaviors if they have access to naloxone remain prevalent, and the measurement scales to assess these risk compensation concerns remain under researched. This study aims to examine the validity of the Naloxone-Related Risk Compensation Beliefs (NaRRC-B) scale and to understand the effect of overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND) training on risk compensation beliefs across demographic and professional populations. Methods: A total of 1424 participants, 803 police officers, 137 emergency medical services (EMS)/fire personnel, and 484 clinical treatment and social service providers were administered surveys before and after attending an OEND training. Survey items measured the endorsement of opioid overdose knowledge and attitudes, as well as risk compensation beliefs. Results: Police and EMS/fire personnel expressed greater endorsement of risk compensation beliefs than clinical treatment and social service providers at both pre- and post-OEND training. Although endorsement of risk compensation beliefs was significantly reduced in each of the 3 groups after the training, reductions were greatest among EMS/fire personnel, followed by providers, then police. Moreover, younger, male, and black participants endorsed greater beliefs in risk compensatory behaviors as compared with their older, female, and white counterparts. Conclusion: This study validated a novel measure of naloxone-related risk compensation beliefs and suggests participating in OEND trainings decreases beliefs in naloxone-related risk compensation behaviors. OEND trainings should consider addressing concerns about naloxone “enabling” drug use, particularly in law enforcement settings, to continue to reduce stigma surrounding naloxone availability.",,10.1080/08897077.2019.1616348,15470164,245,Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration,H79SP022118,85067490482 (Scopus),08897077,2,251,2020-04-02,31170030.0,https://doi.org/10.1080/08897077.2019.1616348,Substance Abuse,41

Our study investigates this dynamic, asking how episodes of electoral violence affect existing levels of foreign direct investment. We argue that, when managing their investments in foreign markets, multinational firms weigh the expected gains of the investment with the probability that the host country experiences significant lapses in political stability. Electoral violence signals a greater risk of this undesirable outcome and, thus, increases the probability that firms divest in favor of more favorable investment environments. Using firm-level data, we investigate the investment behavior of seventy-seven multinational firms in twenty-five Sub-Saharan African countries from 1995 to 2008 with a series of logistic regression models. Directly modeling the choices that firms make with respect to yearly changes in investment, we demonstrate that firms are more likely to divest following events of electoral violence in a host country.

Two embedded, entwined, and exceptional American institutions - broad private property rights and competitive federalism - are necessary for explaining this shift. These two institutions shaped the exceptional stringency of 1970s American environmental laws and the powerful backlash against these laws that continues today. American colonies ensured broad private rights to use land and natural resources for profit. The colonies and the independent state governments that followed wielded expansive authority to govern this commodified environment. In the 1780s, Congress underwrote state governance of the privatized environment by directing the parceling and transfer of federal land to private parties and of environmental governance to future states. The 1787 Constitution cemented these relationships and exposed states to interstate economic competition. Environmental laws of the 1970s imposed unprecedented challenges to the environmental prerogatives long protected by these institutions, and the beneficiaries responded with a wide-ranging counterattack.

This provides a unique opportunity for dream research, as lucid dreamers can send real-time signals from sleep to the external world. Historically, such sleep-to-wake communication from a lucid dream is executed via left-right eye movements, which places hard limitations on information transfer. Recent advances in biomedical equipment-specifically brain-computer interfaces-have resulted in headsets that use neural recordings to translate mental imagery into computer commands. In light of evidence suggesting that dreamed and imagined actions recruit similar neural resources, I considered the possibility that the same mental commands that are collected and translated from waking imagery could be similarly performed and detected from within a lucid dream. In this exploratory study with proof-of-concept intent, three participants were asked to use an Emotiv EPOC+ headset and companion software to map a mental motor command (pushing a block) with a resulting computer action (graphic of block moving forward). After waking training, participants attempted to induce a lucid dream while wearing the headset, and upon lucidity perform the same mental command.

Moreover, MutY-promoted SAM was Mfd dependent, suggesting that transcriptional transactions over nonbulky DNA lesions promoted error-prone repair. Here, we inquired whether Mfd and GreA, which control transcription-coupled repair and transcription fidelity, influence the mutagenic events occurring in nutritionally stressed B. subtilis YB955 cells deficient in the GO or AP endonuclease repair proteins. To this end, mfd and greA were disabled in genetic backgrounds defective in the GO and AP endonuclease repair proteins, and the strains were tested for growth-associated and stress-associated mutagenesis. The results revealed that disruption of mfd or greA abrogated the production of stress-associated amino acid revertants in the GO and nfo exoA nth strains, respectively. These results suggest that in nutritionally stressed B. subtilis cells, spontaneous nonbulky DNA lesions are processed in an error-prone manner with the participation of Mfd and GreA. In support of this notion, stationary-phase ΔytkD ΔmutM ΔmutY (referred to here as ΔGO) and Δnfo ΔexoA Δnth (referred to here as ΔAP) cells accumulated 8-oxoguanine (8-OxoG) lesions, which increased significantly following Mfd disruption. In contrast, during exponential growth, disruption of mfd or greA increased the production of His+, Met+, or Leu+ prototrophs in both DNA repair-deficient strains.

Results: Over 3 months, mean body mass index was significantly reduced. Mean body image was significantly improved regarding all concepts in the model, except body checking. Body image improvement varied widely when individual responses were examined. Conclusions: The model was successfully tested. Data on the five concepts in the model provided a body image profile at 3 months indicating individuals' degree of improvement. Areas of non-improvement in the early postoperative phase may signal the need for interventions, like support or psychological counseling, for patients who might be struggling with views of themselves after surgery.

Breeding for traits such as yield, product quality and pathogen resistance are main priorities. Identifying molecular signatures of these and other important traits is important in future breeding efforts. In this study, a progeny population from a cross between a breeding line, SW93-1015, and a cultivar, Désireé, was studied by trait analysis and RNA-seq in order to develop understanding of segregating traits at the molecular level and identify transcripts with expressional correlation to these traits. Transcript markers with predictive value for field performance applicable under controlled environments would be of great value for plant breeding. Results: A total of 34 progeny lines from SW93-1015 and Désireé were phenotyped for 17 different traits in a field in Nordic climate conditions and controlled climate settings. A master transcriptome was constructed with all 34 progeny lines and the parents through a de novo assembly of RNA-seq reads. Gene expression data obtained in a controlled environment from the 34 lines was correlated to traits by different similarity indices, including Pearson and Spearman, as well as DUO, which calculates the co-occurrence between high and low values for gene expression and trait. Our study linked transcripts to traits such as yield, growth rate, high laying tubers, late and tuber blight, tuber greening and early flowering. We found several transcripts associated to late blight resistance and transcripts encoding receptors were associated to Dickeya solani susceptibility. Transcript levels of a UBX-domain protein was negatively associated to yield and a GLABRA2 expression modulator was negatively associated to growth rate. Conclusion: In our study, we identify 100's of transcripts, putatively linked based on expression with 17 traits of potato, representing both well-known and novel associations. This approach can be used to link the transcriptome to traits. We explore the possibility of associating the level of transcript expression from controlled, optimal environments to traits in a progeny population with different methods introducing the application of DUO for the first time on transcriptome data.

These elections serve as early tests of the photo ID law and offer support for some hypotheses derived from implementation theory. We find evidence of uneven implementation of the photo ID requirement in Missouri. Local jurisdictions using electronic poll books checked in a much larger volume of voters without photo ID than jurisdictions using traditional paper poll books. Interviews with local officials suggest that voter and poll worker behaviour contribute to this pattern. Furthermore, other features, particularly jurisdiction size and the administrative and partisan structure of local officials, are associated with the number of voters who check in without photo identification.

While reactions of glycosyl donors equipped with the 3-O-benzoyl group are typically non-stereoselective because these reactions proceed via the oxacarbenium intermediate, 3-O-picoloylated donors are capable of providing enhanced, but somewhat relaxed, β-stereoselectivity by the HAD pathway. In an attempt to refine this reaction, we noticed that glycosylations are highly β-stereoselective in the presence of NIS and stoichiometric TfOH.

The role of microbial populations within ecosystems and the evolutionary selective pressure on individuals depend fundamentally on the metabolic activity of single cells. Yet, many existing single-cell technologies provide only indirect evidence of metabolic specialization because they rely on correlations between transcription and phenotype established at the level of the population to infer activity. In this study, we take a top-down approach using isotope labels and secondary ion mass spectrometry to track the uptake of carbon and nitrogen atoms from different sources into biomass and directly observe dynamic changes in anabolic specialization at the level of single cells. We investigate the classic microbiological phenomenon of diauxic growth at the single-cell level in the model methylotroph Methylobacterium extorquens. In nature, this organism inhabits the phyllosphere, where it experiences diurnal changes in the available carbon substrates, necessitating an overhaul of central carbon metabolism. We show that the population exhibits a unimodal response to the changing availability of viable substrates, a conclusion that supports the canonical model but has thus far been supported by only indirect evidence. We anticipate that the ability to monitor the dynamics of anabolism in individual cells directly will have important applications across the fields of ecology, medicine, and biogeochemistry, especially where regulation downstream of transcription has the potential to manifest as heterogeneity that would be undetectable with other existing single-cell approaches. IMPORTANCE Understanding how genetic information is realized as the behavior of individual cells is a long-term goal of biology but represents a significant technological challenge. In clonal microbial populations, variation in gene regulation is often interpreted as metabolic heterogeneity. This follows the central dogma of biology, in which information flows from DNA to RNA to protein and ultimately manifests as activity. At present, DNA and RNA can be characterized in single cells, but the abundance and activity of proteins cannot. Inferences about metabolic activity usually therefore rely on the assumption that transcription reflects activity. By tracking the atoms from which they build their biomass, we make direct observations of growth rate and substrate specialization in individual cells throughout a period of growth in a changing environment. This approach allows the flow of information from DNA to be constrained from the distal end of the regulatory cascade and will become an essential tool in the rapidly advancing field of single-cell metabolism.",e01519-19,10.1128/mBio.01519-19,21507511,,U.S. Department of Energy,DE-SC0014613,85081043240 (Scopus),21612129,2,,2020-03-01,32127448.0,https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.01519-19,mBio,11

Imaging was repeated at 24 months. Regional brain volumes were quantified using FreeSurfer's longitudinal pipeline. Voxel-wise analyses using tensor-based morphometry (TBM) were conducted to verify regional assessments. Baseline brain metabolite levels, blood and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers assessed by ELISA, and peripheral blood monocyte phenotypes measured by flow cytometry were examined as predictors of significant volumetric change.Results:Participants were 31±8 years old. The estimated mean duration of infection at cART initiation was 15 days. Longitudinal analyses revealed reductions in volumes of putamen (P<0.001) and caudate (P=0.006). TBM confirmed significant atrophy in the putamen and caudate, and also in thalamic and hippocampal regions.

We then inferred whether migratory birds transport haemosporidian parasite lineages between the breeding and wintering grounds. Location: Sierra de Bahoruco National Park, Dominican Republic, Hispaniola. Taxa: Migratory and resident birds (primarily Aves: Passeriformes) and their haemosporidian parasites (order Haemosporida, Plasmodium, Haemoproteus and Parahaemoproteus). Methods: We used mist nets to capture birds in thorn scrub, broadleaf dry forests and pine forests during midwinter. We used molecular methods to recognize haemosporidian parasites in blood samples, and genotyped infections based on the nucleotide differences in a region of the parasite cytochrome b gene. Results and Main Conclusion: We identified 505 infections by 32 haemosporidian parasite lineages in 1,780 blood samples from 37 resident species, and in 901 blood samples from 14 overwintering migratory species, over five years at the same sites. Infection prevalence varied among migratory species from zero to 13%, whereas infection prevalence among resident species ranged up to 77%. Host relatedness did not predict parasite assemblage similarity. We discuss four hypotheses for the rarity of haemosporidian infections in migratory birds during winter, and for the infrequency of parasite sharing between migratory and resident birds: (a) relative abundance and host preferences of dipteran vectors lower parasite transmission to migratory birds; (b) parasite lineages adapted to infect endemic Caribbean hosts are unable to infect migratory species; (c) the physiology of migratory birds after migration and during winter reduces parasite survival; and (d) infected individuals suffer more pronounced mortality rates during migration.

Data were drawn from the multiwave Missouri Family Study (n = 1,349) of African American (AA; n = 450) and White families (n = 317) enriched for risk for alcohol use disorder and includes those who were assessed for gambling behaviors and problems: AA (360 males, 390 females) and White (287 males, 312 females). Findings indicated racial differences in the overall prevalence of gambling behaviors and substance use as well as patterns of initiation-particularly within gambling/alcohol and gambling/tobacco for males. Survival models revealed some similarities as well as differences across race and gender groups in associations of gambling with initiation of substances, as well as substances with initiation of gambling. Alcohol use (AA males only) and cannabis use (AA males and White females) elevated the hazards of initiating gambling. In contrast, gambling significantly elevated the hazards of initiation alcohol across 3 of 4 groups and of cannabis use in AA males only.

While previous studies have found that separated women do in fact have a higher risk for IPV than nonseparated women, these largely bivariate examinations of marital status and risk for IPV have often not considered the effect other characteristics may have on risk estimates. The current study uses the 1995-2010 National Crime Victimization Surveys to examine how separated women’s risk for IPV compares with nonseparated women’s risk for IPV over time, and if separated, women’s risk for IPV is a function of either being separated or possessing characteristics known to be correlated with risk. A key strength of this study is its ability to account for the confounding effects of change in separation status and IPV. Results show that separated women were more likely than nonseparated women to be victims of IPV in most years from 1995 to 2010, and after controlling for the effects of individual-level characteristics, their risk did not change. Age was the only significant predictor of women’s risk for IPV, net of other factors, but had no effect on separated women’s risk for IPV.

Neopterin is a biomarker that is a product of the cell-mediated immune response, with high levels being indicative of poor survival expectations in some cases. The measurement of urinary neopterin concentration (UNC) has been validated as a method for monitoring cell-mediated immune system activation in multiple catarrhine species, but to date there is no study testing its utility in the urine of platyrrhine species. In this study, we collected urine samples across three platyrrhine families including small captive populations of Leontopithecus rosalia and Pithecia pithecia, and larger wild populations of Leontocebus weddelli, Saguinus imperator, Alouatta seniculus, and Plecturocebus toppini, to evaluate a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the measurement of urinary neopterin in platyrrhines. Results: Our results revealed measured UNC fell within the sensitivity range of the assay in all urine samples collected from captive and wild platyrrhine study species via commercial ELISA, and results from several dilutions met expectations. We found significant differences in the mean UNC across all study species. Most notably, we observed higher UNC in the wild population of L. weddelli which is known to have two filarial nematode infections compared to S. imperator, which only have one. Conclusion: Our study confirms that neopterin is measurable via commercial ELISA in urine collected from captive and wild individuals of six genera of platyrrhines across three different families. These findings promote the future utility of UNC as a promising biomarker for field primatologists conducting research in Latin America to non-invasively evaluate cell-mediated immune system activation from urine.",2,10.1186/s40850-020-00051-9,20563132,,,,85080860176 (Scopus),,1,,2020-02-27,,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40850-020-00051-9,BMC Zoology,5

However, the factors that affect the performance of deep learning in contact prediction have not been systematically investigated. Results: We analyzed the results of our three deep learning-based contact prediction methods (MULTICOMCLUSTER, MULTICOM-CONSTRUCT and MULTICOM-NOVEL) in the CASP13 experiment and identified several key factors [i.e. deep learning technique, multiple sequence alignment (MSA), distance distribution prediction and domain-based contact integration] that influenced the contact prediction accuracy. We compared our convolutional neural network (CNN)-based contact prediction methods with three coevolution-based methods on 75 CASP13 targets consisting of 108 domains. We demonstrated that the CNN-based multi-distance approach was able to leverage global coevolutionary coupling patterns comprised of multiple correlated contacts for more accurate contact prediction than the local coevolution-based methods, leading to a substantial increase of precision by 19.2 percentage points. We also tested different alignment methods and domain-based contact prediction with the deep learning contact predictors. The comparison of the three methods showed deeper sequence alignments and the integration of domain-based contact prediction with the full-length contact prediction improved the performance of contact prediction. Moreover, we demonstrated that the domain-based contact prediction based on a novel ab initio approach of parsing domains from MSAs alone without using known protein structures was a simple, fast approach to improve contact prediction. Finally, we showed that predicting the distribution of inter-residue distances in multiple distance intervals could capture more structural information and improve binary contact prediction.

As the most volatile molecules systematically observed in comets, the abundances of CO, CH4, and C2H6 in short-period comets may serve to elucidate the interplay between natal conditions and post-formative evolution in setting present-day composition, yet secure measurements of CO and CH4 in Jupiter-family comets (JFCs) are especially sparse.

Here, we describe variation in haemosporidian prevalence (i.e. the proportion of infected individuals in a sampled population) in Neotropical birds. We review correlates of haemosporidian prevalence (including several avian life-history traits, climate, and season) and the population and evolutionary consequences of infection for Neotropical birds. We find that prevalence varies among avian taxonomic families, genera, and even among species within the same genus, suggesting that prevalence reflects multiple factors, some of which (e.g., avian incubation period) are associated with avian family-level variation in prevalence while others (e.g., avian abundance) are associated with variation in prevalence among closely related host species. We find few correlates of prevalence that have been consistently demonstrated across studies. Prevalence in populations of many Neotropical birds has been estimated by microscopic examination of blood smears, which affords limited opportunity for comparison with data generated by molecular methods. However, at one site in the Brazilian Cerrado for which we have data, prevalence determined by microscopy does not correlate with prevalence determined by molecular methods for Plasmodium, but the 2 data types are positively correlated for Haemoproteus. Haemosporidians have been hypothesized to play a role in avian sexual selection, and we find the prevalence of Haemoproteus to be lower in polygynous species than in socially monogamous species in the Neotropics, confirming a pattern shown previously among Nearctic birds. LAY SUMMARY Many Neotropical birds are infected by insect-vectored blood parasites belonging to the order Haemosporida. These haemosporidian parasites, commonly known as ""avian malaria""parasites, infect bird species to varying degrees. The proportion of birds in a population that are infected (parasite prevalence) has been related to variation in several avian traits, including length of incubation period and nesting height, climate, and other factors, but the patterns are not consistent among studies. We review proposed causes of variation in haemosporidian prevalence and potential consequences of infection for bird populations. Haemosporidian parasites have plausibly been involved in the evolution of colorful plumage and mating systems in birds. Here we find evidence for lower prevalence of haemosporidian infection associated with polygyny (where individual males mate with multiple females) in the Neotropics. Avian haemosporidian parasites exert an important influence on the health and adaptive responses of Neotropical birds.",ukaa055,10.1093/auk/ukaa055,,,,,85092359114 (Scopus),00048038,4,,2020-02-01,,https://doi.org/10.1093/auk/ukaa055,Auk,137

We assessed the diversity and activity of bats in the Crocker Range Biosphere Reserve (CRBR) in Sabah, Malaysia, using harp traps, mist nets and acoustic surveys in each zone-core, buffer, transition and in agricultural plots outside of the reserve. We captured 30 species, bringing the known bat fauna of CRBR to 50 species, half of Borneo's bat species. Species composition and acoustic activity varied among zones and by foraging ensemble, with the core and buffer showing particular importance for conserving forest-dependent insectivorous bats. Frugivorous bats were found in all zones but were the most abundant and most species-rich ensemble within agricultural sites. Although sampling was limited, bat diversity and activity was low in the transition zone compared to other zones, indicating potential for management practices that increase food availability and enhance biodiversity value. We conclude that, collectively, the zones of the CRBR effectively protect diversity, but the value of the transition zone can be improved.",60,10.3390/d12020060,14242818,,,165871,85080874015 (Scopus),,2,,2020-02-01,,https://doi.org/10.3390/d12020060,Diversity,12

As HIV-related cognitive impairment (CI) impacts adherence, we examined frequency and predictors of CI in the African Cohort Study. SETTING: Cross-sectional examination of enrollment data from President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief supported clinic sites. METHODS: In a 30-minute cognitive assessment, CI was defined as -1SD on 2 tests or -2SD on one, as compared with 429 controls. We performed univariable and multivariable logistic and linear models examining clinical and demographic factors associated with CI and global neuropsychological performance (NP-6). RESULTS: Two thousand four hundred seventy-two HIV+ participants from Kenya (n = 1503), Tanzania (n = 469), and Uganda (n = 500). The mean (SD) age was 39.7 (10.7) years, and 1452 (59%) were women. The majority reported completing or partially completing primary school (n = 1584, 64%). Mean (SD) current and nadir CD4 count were 463 (249) and 204 (221) cells/mm, respectively; 1689 (68%) were on combination antiretroviral therapy.

Moreover, the clinical and socio-environmental factors that promote resilient developmental outcomes among VPT children are poorly understood. Methods: One hundred and twenty five children (85 VPT and 40 full-term) underwent neurodevelopmental evaluation at age 5-years. Parents and teachers completed measures of internalizing, externalizing, attention-deficit/hyperactivity (ADHD), and autism symptoms. Psychiatric and neurodevelopmental measures were analyzed using Latent Profile Analysis. Multinomial regression examined the extent that infant, sociodemographic, and family factors, collected prospectively from birth to follow-up, independently differentiated resilient and impaired children. Results: Four latent profiles were identified, including a Typically Developing Group which represented 27.1% of the VPT group and 65.0% of the full-term group, an At-Risk Group with mild psychiatric and neurodevelopmental problems (VPT 44.7%, full-term 22.5%), a Psychiatric Group with moderate-to-severe psychiatric ratings (VPT 12.9%, full-term 10.0%), and a school-based Inattentive/Hyperactive Group (VPT 15.3%, full-term 2.5%). Clinical diagnoses were highest among the Psychiatric Group (80%). Factors that differentiated resilient and impaired subgroups of VPT children included prolonged exposure to maternal psychosocial distress (p ≤.04), current family dysfunction (p ≤.05), and maternal ADHD symptoms (p ≤.02), whereas social risk index scores differentiated resilient and impaired full-term children (p <.03).

Our results reveal that paternal care positively impacts offspring survival, that males producing longer calls also provide higher-quality paternal care in the form of greater egg attendance and territory defense, and that females prefer longer calls. Females did not discriminate among potential mates based on differences in dominant frequency or call rate.

Up to 300 fs, the lattice distortion has been stabilized. During the formation of hot excitons, the prominent self-trapping effect of conjugated polymer triggers the occurrence of local infrared active phonon modes, with five peaks in the phonon spectrum as the hot excitons relax.

Neuropsychiatric adverse events (NP-AEs) have been reported with DTG but neuropsychiatric symptoms have not been systemically quantified using structured scales. This study examined mood and cognitive parameters before and after a planned transition from non-DTG to DTG-based ART within a longitudinal study of acute HIV infection (AHI). Methods: RV254 AHI cohort participants on ≥ 24 weeks of ART initiated at AHI underwent sequential assessments before and after the switch including: (1) Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), a 9-item survey (scores 0-27) that evaluates somatic and affective/cognitive symptoms of depression; (2) a 2-Questions screening that has been validated locally for depression; (3) Distress Thermometer (scores 0-10); and 4) administration of a 4-test neurocognitive battery sensitive to HIV. Results: 254 individuals (95% male, median age 30) switched to a DTG-based regimen after a median 144 weeks of ART. Serial assessments were completed at a median of 19 weeks before and 37 weeks after DTG.

Conclusion: After a median duration of 37 weeks of DTG use, there was a modest increase in the higher quartile of PHQ-9. This increase was associated with a rise in moderate depression symptoms but not the more severe forms of depression on PHQ-9. No clinically relevant NP-AEs were reported.

This study investigated the occurrence and correlates of sexual coercion during intercourse for conception among infertile couples. A convenience sample of heterosexual couples (N = 105) with infertility were recruited from clinics and online forums. Members of the couple separately completed an online questionnaire. Members of the couple answered questions about their partner's use of sexual coercion during intercourse for conception and not for conception. Then they completed measures of psychological distress, relationship adjustment, and sexual functioning. A significantly higher proportion of men (37%) than women (12%) reported being verbally pressured by their partner to engage in intercourse for the purposes of conception. For men, but not women, experiencing sexual coercion during intercourse for conception was associated with psychological distress and poor relationship adjustment. Qualitative data provided context for understanding the impact of infertility on participants’ sexual relationships.

It has been hypothesized that convergent evolution of floral form has resulted in “pollination syndromes” - i.e. suites of floral traits that correspond to attraction of particular pollinator functional groups. Across the literature, the pollination syndrome concept has received mixed support. This may be due to studies using different methods to describe floral traits and/or the pollination syndrome concept being supported more often in species highly reliant on pollinators for reproduction. Here, we assess the predictive ability of pollination syndromes in Oenothera, a species rich clade with pollination systems existing on a gradient of specialization, and in which species are either self-compatible or self-incompatible. We ask the following questions: Do Oenothera species follow the pollination syndrome concept using traditional, categorical floral trait descriptions and/or quantitative floral trait measurements? And, are floral traits more predictive of primary pollinators in species with specialized pollination systems and/or species that are self-incompatible? Mapping floral traits of 54 Oenothera species into morphospace, we do not find support for the pollination syndrome concept using either categorical or quantitative floral trait descriptions. We do not find support for specialization or breeding system influencing the prediction of primary pollinators. However, we find pollination syndromes were more predictive in Oenothera species with moth pollination systems. Collectively, these results suggest that the pollination syndrome concept cannot be generally applied across taxa and that evolutionary history is important to consider when evaluating the relationship between floral form and contemporary pollinators.",,,19207603,52,National Science Foundation,DDIG 0910202,85106521871 (Scopus),,,66,2020-01-01,,,Journal of Pollination Ecology,26

Trauma exposure and levels of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSSs) may play a role in understanding gun attitudes; however, these putative associations have not been empirically determined. The aim of the study was to investigate if cumulative trauma, specific violent trauma types (i.e., violent death, and physical, weapon, and sexual assault), and PTSS are related to more positive gun attitudes. Method: A total of 495 adults from Amazon Mechanical Turk (18.5%) or a midwestern university (81.4%; Mage = 25.81 SD = 9.88, 59.5% female, 71.2% White) participated in the study. Results: Cumulative trauma was associated with more progun rights beliefs but not with perceptions that guns provide protection from victimization or deter crime. Despite expectations, PTSSs were not tied to gun attitudes. In the model with the specific types of violent trauma, weapon assault was related to a stronger endorsement that guns offer protection, whereas physical assault was inversely associated with this belief. None of the four types of violent trauma nor PTSS were related to beliefs regarding gun rights or guns and crime. Conclusion: Although PTSS was consistently unrelated to gun attitudes, cumulative trauma exposure may correspond with gun rights beliefs. There also appears to be distinctions in type of violent trauma exposure and discrete gun attitudes.

Our sample consisted of 437 U.S. adults, recruited through Mturk, who evaluated fictitious leaders. Results suggested that leaders were, indeed, subject to statistically significant weight penalties in perceived leader effectiveness, which operated indirectly via decreased perceptions of leader prototypicality.

Relative compensation has a larger impact on profit when tasks are more complex and a smaller impact on profit, revenue, and quality when chain monitoring is stronger. Finally, the magnitude of the relation between relative compensation and financial performance (nonfinancial) is larger (the same) for employees earning more than the median wage compared with those earning less.

Violating long-standing partisan taboos, the AfD ""victory"" is a weak reflection of national-populist forces that have gained control of other European governments over the last decade. This paper addresses the ostensible causes of resurgent ethno-nationalism across eu states, especially the global financial crisis of 2008/2009 and Merkel's principled stance on refugees and asylum seekers as of 2015. The primary causes fueling this negative resurgence are systemic in nature, reflecting the deconstruction of welfare states, shifts in political discourse, and opportunistic, albeit misguided responses to demographic change. It highlights a curious gender-twist underlying AfD support, particularly in the East, stressing eight factors that have led disproportionate numbers of middle-aged men to gravitate to such movements.

A total of 13 female survivors who developed breast cancer–related lymphedema participated by completing a survey and a 60-min semi-structured interview. Results: Four main themes emerged: (1) breast cancer–related lymphedema affects physical and emotional functioning associated with work; (2) ongoing treatment for breast cancer–related lymphedema creates challenges for work; (3) environmental factors affect the return-to-work experience; and (4) personal factors play a key role in adjusting to return-to-work.

Collective efficacy theory is a commonly used framework to prevent juvenile delinquency. Although community-level interventions have been developed based on collective efficacy, research suggests that they are limited in their effectiveness. This may be due to limitations in our conceptualisation of collective efficacy, and our limited understanding of how perceptions of collective efficacy differ between youths and parents. The present study utilises data from the Fragile Families Child Wellbeing Study to test parent and youth perceptions of collective efficacy as predictors of self-reported juvenile delinquency. The results indicate that- A lthough collective efficacy is typically associated with lower levels of juvenile delinquency in neighbourhoods-neither parents' nor youths' perceptions of collective efficacy are strong predictors of self-reported juvenile delinquency.

We contribute to the literature by studying living a calling, which we conceptualize as a resource, to examine how and why it is related to perceived work ability (i.e., one’s perception of their ability to continue working in their current job) among women working in domestic violence services. We propose that by living out one’s calling, domestic violence services workers may perceive fewer of the salient interpersonal demands in their jobs (relationship conflict among colleagues, workplace incivility from clients served), which may partially explain a linkage to greater perceived work ability. We tested hypotheses using 2-wave survey data. The results suggest that there are direct and indirect positive relations between living a calling and perceived work ability. Workers living out their calling perceive less relationship conflict among colleagues, which partially explains the positive relation with perceived work ability. However, we did not find support for the similarly proposed mediating role of perceived client incivility. Theoretical implications for studying calling and practical implications for career counselors and organizations are discussed. For example, career counselors may consider the presence of a calling when exploring clients’ career development in domestic violence work, whereas social service providers may benefit by selecting employees for whom the work aligns with their calling and creating opportunities for their calling to be lived out to facilitate perceived work ability.",,10.1037/cou0000387,,241,,,85080829339 (Scopus),00220167,2,250,2020-01-01,31556626.0,https://doi.org/10.1037/cou0000387,Journal of Counseling Psychology,67

Higher nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase levels correlated with lower volumes of thalamus (p = .005) and cerebral white matter (p = .049) and, in the CC, with lower FA (p = .011, body; p = .005, genu; p = .009, total CC) and higher MD (p = .023, body; p = .035, genu; p = .019, splenium; p = .014, total CC). Greater cytochrome c oxidase levels correlated with lower thalamic (p = .034) and cerebellar gray matter (p = .021) volumes.

Although studies have established relationships between neuroticism and neurological functioning in various brain regions for healthy and depressed individuals, the specific neural correlates of neuroticism for individuals with PTSD are yet unknown. This relationship is particularly relevant for women, given that their increased risk for PTSD is partially accounted for by their higher baseline levels of neuroticism. The current study examined previously established neural correlates of neuroticism in 61 women (48 women with interpersonal violence [IPV]/PTSD and 13 healthy controls). A specific region of interest map, including the amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), was examined while participants completed an emotional conflict task. Results showed that the PTSD group had significantly higher neuroticism scores than the healthy control group (t = 6.90, p <.001). Higher neuroticism scores were associated with increased neural activity in the right dmPFC when participants were instructed to directly attend to faces with negative emotional valences. Significant trends between higher neuroticism scores and greater right amygdala and right ACC activation also emerged for this condition. Finally, neuroticism was found to be associated with right amygdala and right parahippocampal activity when participants were instructed to ignore faces with negative emotional valences. The results of this study lend further evidence to the proposed diathesis-stress model of neuroticism and PTSD. Moreover, findings suggest a significant association between neuroticism and neural activity in brain regions associated with fear and emotion regulation for women with IPV and subsequent PTSD.",,10.1177/0886260516682519,15526518,341,National Institute of Mental Health,K23MH090366,85076684861 (Scopus),08862605,1-2,363,2020-01-01,29294627.0,https://doi.org/10.1177/0886260516682519,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,35

However, results from research based on men’s self-reported sexual perpetration are suspect because men may intentionally conceal their sexually aggressive behavior. The current study used a Bogus Pipeline (BPL) methodology to determine whether young, community men (N = 93) intentionally underreport their use of sexually aggressive strategies on two self-report measures of perpetration. Compared with men in a Standard Testing (ST) condition, men in an experimental BPL condition—who believed that the honesty of their responses was being monitored—had 6.5 times greater odds of endorsing the use of illegal sexual assault strategies on a widely used measure. Indeed, over a third of men in the BPL condition admitted to using such strategies. However, there was no significant difference in men’s reports of verbally coercive strategies in the BPL versus the ST condition on the same measure. There were also no significant differences in reporting on the other, less commonly used measure of sexual aggression as a function of condition.

Soybean WRINKLED1 (WRI1) a and b, with their alternative splicing (AS) products a’ and b’, are highly expressed in developing seeds and nodules, but their functions in soybean nodulation are not known. GmWRI1a and b differently promoted triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulation in both Arabidopsis wild-type and wri1 mutant seeds and when they ectopically expressed in the soybean hairy roots. Transcriptome analysis revealed that 15 genes containing AW boxes in their promoters were targeted by GmWRI1s, including genes involved in glycolysis, fatty acid (FA) and TAG biosynthesis. GmWRI1a, GmWRI1b and b’ differentially transactivated most targeted genes. Overexpression of GmWRI1s affected phospholipid and galactolipid synthesis, soluble sugar and starch contents and led to increased nodule numbers, whereas GmWRI1 knockdown hairy roots interfered root glycolysis and lipid biosynthesis and resulted in fewer nodules. These phenomena in GmWRI1 mutants coincided with the altered expression of nodulation genes. Thus, GmWRI1-regulated starch degradation, glycolysis and lipid biosynthesis were critical for nodulation. GmWRI1 mutants also altered auxin and other hormone-related biosynthesis and hormone-related genes, by which GmWRI1s may affect nodule development.

Five types of enforcement actions are examined: felony, misdemeanor, municipal, and bench warrant arrests and criminal summonses-in-lieu of arrest. Results indicate that enforcement activity decreased over the study period, particularly for nonfelony arrests among Blacks. City-wide trends obscure some variability in neighborhood enforcement. Neighborhood trends in enforcement varied by type of action, but in all cases, trends were conditioned by racial composition. For example, misdemeanor and bench warrant arrests exhibited steeper declines in neighborhoods with a higher percentage of Black residents, resulting in a narrowing of the race gap. In contrast, differences in criminal summonses across neighborhoods of varying racial compositions increased. The effects persisted net of measures of economic disadvantage, community location, residential mobility, household composition, calls for service, and population size.

M. Keck Observatory on two post-perihelion dates (UT 2017 February 13 and 19), when the comet was at heliocentric distances of 1.01 and 1.10 AU, respectively. On UT February 13, H2O was measured simultaneously with six trace parent molecules: CH3OH, C2H6, HCN, NH3, C2H2, and H2CO. On UT February 19, CH4 and CO were also targeted in addition to the species measured on UT February 13. Abundances of CO, CH4, and C2H2 relative to H2O are consistent with values obtained from IRTF/iSHELL observations of 45P in early January 2017 just after perihelion when the heliocentric distance was 0.55–0.56 AU. Differences are seen in H2CO/H2O, C2H6/H2O, CH3OH/H2O, and HCN/H2O in February compared to January. Additionally, NH3 abundances appear highly variable during the February measurements, suggesting possible fluctuations of a factor of ten; however, there is significant uncertainty in quantifying NH3 owing to the marginal detections of only one or two lines on each of the two dates. Combining all infrared spectroscopic observations of 45P in January and February 2017, a post-perihelion relationship of Q(H2O) = (2.81 ± 0.25) × 1027 [Rh(−3.83±0.18)] molecules s−1 is derived. However, all measurements suggest significant variability in H2O production on timescales of hours and days. Compared to other comets, volatile abundances relative to H2O in 45P are as follows: CO (depleted relative to all measured comets), CH3OH (enriched/all comets), CH4 and C2H6 (typical/all comets, enriched/Jupiter-family comets), C2H2 (depleted/all comets, typical/Jupiter-family comets), H2CO (January: typical, February depleted/all comets), HCN (January: severely depleted, February: typical/Jupiter-family comets). The small geocentric distances of the comet in February 2017 provide high spatial resolution in the coma of 45P (~12 and 19 km/pixel on February 13 and 19, respectively). Overall, the spatial distributions of volatiles and dust suggest a relatively symmetric and uniform coma during the UT February 13 and 19 observations, with small spatial differences noted between some volatile species. Measured C2H2 and HCN abundances are consistent with HCN as the primary parent of CN and C2H2 as a significant but not primary parent for C2, based on C2 and CN production rate measurements from the 2017 and previous apparitions.

Participants’ perceptions of what is attractive were closely linked to Western hegemonic masculinity, the media, and Asian sociocultural influences from family. Participants reported feeling confused about what constitutes an ideal body image for them due to the lack of representation and negative stereotypes in U.S. media and gendered racism in U.S. society. Their confusion also arises from discrepant messages they receive from their family and the media. They described several adaptive strategies to cope with negative body image.

This conceptual framework prioritizes rapid, sustained, low-barrier access to MOUD for optimal impact on decreased illicit drug use and mortality. Medication First principles and practices were facilitated through state-level structural changes and disseminated to participating community treatment programs via a multi-pronged, multi-disciplinary approach. In the first nine months of STR, 14 state-contracted treatment agencies operating 38 sites used STR funding to implement the Medication First model. Methods: We utilized state billing and service data to make comparisons before and during STR on the following outcomes: MOUD utilization, timely access to MOUD, amount of psychosocial services delivered, treatment retention at 1, 3, and 6 months, and monthly price of treatment. We conducted follow-up analyses examining differences across MOUD types (no medication, methadone, buprenorphine, oral naltrexone, mixed antagonist + agonist, and extended release naltrexone). Results: During STR, MOUD utilization increased (44.8% to 85.3%), timeliness of MOUD receipt improved (Median of 8 days vs. 0 days), there were fewer psychosocial services delivered, treatment retention improved at one, three, and six month timeframes, and the median cost per month was 21% lower than in the year prior to STR. All differences were driven by increased utilization of buprenorphine. Conclusions: Findings suggest Medication First implementation through STR was successful in all targeted domains.

Results: When compared to PreDM females, males with PreDM had significantly higher 10-year ICVD risk In contrast, the opposite pattern of 10-year ICVD risk was observed in T2DM; males had significantly lower 10-year ICVD risk. Moreover, compared to T2DM females, males with T2DM had a lower proportion s with moderate or greater ICVD risk (p < 0.001). When compared to PreDM males, males with T2DM < 1 year, and with T2DM 1-5 years had no difference in 10-year ICVD risk, but had higher ICVD risk with T2DM ≥5 years (p < 0.05). Compared to PreDM females, females with T2DM in all subgroups had higher ICVD risk (p < 0.05). Among those with T2DM, hypertension rates of awareness, treatment and control were 78.60%, 65.38% and 31.10%, respectively; hyperlipidemia rates of awareness, treatment and control were lower (29.15%, 8.30% and 3.47%, respectively). Females with T2DM had higher prevalence, awareness and treatment of hypertension and hyperlipidemia than males with T2DM (p < 0.001). Conclusions: There is a greater need for cardiovascular risk reduction programs for females with T2DM at diagnosis. Given the low numbers for awareness, treatment and control of hypertension and hyperlipidemia in both males and females, significant resources focused on them must be expended, specifically improving regular assessment of blood pressure and blood lipids.

Research on the feeding behavior of mosquitoes can provide clues to the hosts and vectors involved in disease transmission. This information is particularly critical for endemic wildlife fauna in island systems that have evolved without resistance to novel diseases such as avian malaria. The aims of this study were to determine the blood-feeding patterns of two species of mosquitoes found in Galápagos and discuss how their feeding behavior may influence the transmission of pathogens such as avian malaria. Methods: In the summer of 2015, we sampled two mosquito species (Aedes taeniorhynchus and Culex quinquefasciatus) across 18 different sites on Isla Santa Cruz, which is the second largest island in Galápagos and has the largest human population. We trapped mosquitoes using CDC light traps and CDC gravid traps and identified sources of blood meals for engorged mosquitoes by sequencing a portion of the vertebrate mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. Results: Out of 947 female mosquitoes captured, 320 were blood-fed, and PCR amplifications were successful for 301 of the blood meals. Results revealed that both Aedes taeniorhynchus and Culex quinquefasciatus feed from a variety of vertebrate taxa, numerically dominated by humans on Isla Santa Cruz.

Incubation behavior influences embryonic development rate and varies substantially among species. We studied attendance at the nest by videoing nests or collecting data from the literature for 112 species in north temperate and lowland tropical sites, then associated patterns of incubation on- and off-bouts with species and environmental traits. Songbirds nesting at low elevations incubate their eggs for an average of 74.1% (±12.9 SD, n = 60 species) of the time in temperate regions and 71.0% (±12.2 SD, n = 52 species) in tropical regions during daylight hours, and 84.3% (±8.2 SD) and 85.3% (±6.2 SD), respectively, of each 24-hr cycle. While these attendance percentages do not differ significantly between latitudes, our data also show that lowland tropical songbirds make fewer visits to the nest and, consequently, have longer on-bouts and off-bouts during incubation. This pattern in attendance reflects a latitudinal contrast in parental care strategy, where lowland tropical birds reduce visits to the nest by increasing on- and off-bout lengths while maintaining the same proportion of time spent incubating their eggs (constancy). Similar constancy across latitude suggests that tropical and temperate birds may be similarly constrained to maintain elevated egg temperatures for normal embryo growth. The different attendance strategies adopted in each region may reflect differences in ambient temperature, adult foraging time, and nest predation rate. Consistently warm ambient temperatures likely allow tropical birds to take longer off-bouts, and thereby to reduce activity around the nest, compared to temperate birds.",,10.1002/ece3.5812,20457758,13555,Directorate for Biological Sciences,0212587,85075447862 (Scopus),,23,13566,2019-12-01,,https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.5812,Ecology and Evolution,9

Measures need to be taken to prevent overdoses by opioid misuse as well as prevent the transition into injection drug use, a high risk factor for contracting HIV/HCV. This study utilized social media to survey individuals currently misusing opioids to identify groups of individuals with different risk and use patterns. Methods: We recruited participants for our online survey from Reddit. Five risk behaviors were used to characterize overdose and HIV/HCV risk groups. Gender, age, and socioeconomic status were also included in the analyses, as well as items outlining social media use surrounding opioids. Results: Two groups of participants were characterized by high likelihoods of different combinations of risky behaviors: (1) Overdose Risk Group and (2) Sexual Risk Group. Those in the Overdose Risk Group were more likely to be younger in age and female, and this group was more likely to desire or be ready for treatment relative to the lowest risk group. Those in the Sexual Risk Group were more likely to be of a minority race/ethnicity, to desire or be ready for treatment, and to post more often on Reddit about opioid use.

Individual parasite infection data from two wild populations of New World primates, the saddleback (Leontocebus weddelli) and emperor (Saguinus imperator) tamarin, were collected over 3 years to establish baseline levels of helminth prevalence and parasite species richness (PSR). Secondarily, we explored variation in parasite prevalence across age and sex classes, test nonrandom associations of parasite co-occurrence, and assess the relationship between group size and PSR. From 288 fecal samples across 105 individuals (71 saddleback and 34 emperor tamarins), 10 parasite taxa were identified by light microscopy following centrifugation and ethyl-acetate sedimentation.

Host age was positively associated with Prosthenorchis ova and filariform larva, but negatively with cestode and the Rhabditoidea ova. We detected no differences between expected and observed levels of co-infection, nor between group size and parasite species richness over 30 group-years. Logistic models of individual infection status did not identify a sex bias; however, age and species predicted the presence of four and three parasite taxa, respectively, with saddleback tamarins exhibiting higher PSR.

In this study, the roles of the homologous multidrug resistance regulators MarA, SoxS, Rob, and RamA (constituting the mar-sox-rob regulon in S.

The new chain code is implemented via developing an agent-based modeling simulation consisting of rabbits, carrots, and paths for the rabbits to wander. The environment in the model represents an actual bi-level image consisting of zeros and ones. In our 'biological reproduction' method, a rabbit starts wandering in the virtual world to consume carrots, while its movements are tracked and recorded by the algorithm. Each rabbit's movement is recorded based on its previous movement. Additionally, after a rabbit consumes a certain number of carrots, it gains energy and therefore reproduces another rabbit, which continues to work on the same image, and so on. Accordingly, more rabbits simultaneously work on different parts of an image, which makes the biological reproduction method advantageous over many other classical image processing approaches.

Polyamides have DNA binding affinities that are comparable to those proteins, therefore, can potentially be used as therapeutic agents to treat diseases caused by aberrant gene expression. In fact, many diseases are characterized by over- or under-expressed genes. PU.1 is a transcription factor that regulates many immune system genes. Aberrant expression of PU.1 has been associated with the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We have, therefore, designed and synthesized ten hairpin polyamides to investigate their capacity in controlling the PU.1-DNA interaction.

Participants underwent neuroimaging with 3 Tesla MRI, and completed a behavioral test of inhibition (i.e., Go/NoGo task). Quantitative tractography derived from diffusion tensor imaging (qtDTI) was used to measure white matter fiber bundle lengths (FBLs) in tracts known to innervate frontal brain regions, including the anterior corpus callosum (AntCC), the cingulate gyrus segment of the cingulum bundle (CING), uncinate fasciculus (UNC), and the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). Performance on the Go/NoGo task was measured by the number of commission errors standardized to reaction time. Hierarchical regression models revealed that shorter FBLs in the CING (p < 0.05) and the bilateral UNC (p < 0.01) were associated with lower inhibitory performance after adjusting for multiple comparisons, supporting a disconnection model of response inhibition in older adults.

This study demonstrates that sensitivity analyses offer a statistical approach to help assess such concerns with two empirical examples—delinquent peer influence and school commitment. Methods: Data from the Gang Resistance Education and Training are used with models that: (1) account for theoretically-relevant controls; (2) incorporate lagged dependent variables and; (3) account for fixed-effects. We use generalized sensitivity analysis (Harada in ISA: Stata module to perform Imbens’ (2003) sensitivity analysis, 2012; Imbens in Am Econ Rev 93(2):126–132, 2003) to estimate the size of unobserved heterogeneity necessary to render delinquent peer influence and school commitment statistically non-significant and substantively weak and compare these estimates to covariates in order to gauge the likely existence of such bias. Results: Unobserved bias would need to be unreasonably large to render the peer effect statistically non-significant for violence and substance use, though less so to reduce it to a weak effect. The observed effect of school commitment on delinquency is much more fragile to unobserved heterogeneity. Conclusion: Questions over the sensitivity of inferences plague criminology.

However, research highlights a critical disparity in firearm-related deaths by race. Researchers often cite racial bias as a contributing factor for the racial disparity in firearm-related deaths. To provide a foundation for potential social work interventions, the present article discusses the results of an assessment of whether explicit racial biases toward four racial and ethnic groups (white, black, Asian, Hispanic/Latino), fear of crime, and the quantity and quality of interactions with neighbors of a different race are predictors of gun ownership. Findings suggest that explicit racial bias toward black, Asian, and Hispanic/Latino individuals is a significant predictor of gun ownership. Fear of crime and more frequent interactions with neighbors of a different race are also significant predictors of gun ownership. Taken as a whole, findings suggest that gun owners are more likely to be more vigilant toward people of color because of stereotypical assumptions that racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to be involved with crime.

Of 16 environmental variables, actual evapotranspiration, minimum temperature of the coldest month, and annual precipitation most strongly influenced regional species richness, phylogenetic dispersion, and phylogenetic diversity for both gymnosperms (cone-bearing plants) and angiosperms (flowering plants). For most evolutionary clades at, and above, the family level, the relationships between metrics of phylogenetic dispersion (i.e., average phylogenetic distance among species), or phylogenetic diversity, and the 3 environmental variables were consistent with the tropical niche conservatism hypothesis, which predicts closer phylogenetic relatedness and reduced phylogenetic diversity with increasing environmental stress. The slopes of the relationships between phylogenetic relatedness and the 3 environmental drivers identified in this analysis were steeper for primarily tropical clades, implying greater niche conservatism, than for primarily temperate clades.

Differential tolerance to increasing heterospecific pollen deposition in two sympatric species of Burmeistera (Campanulaceae: Lobelioideae),OA,-,-,-,Green Final OA,-,https://doi.org/10.1086/705735,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85074688909,"Bat pollination, Interspecific pollen transfer, Pollination competition, Reproductive interference, Reproductive isolation, Reproductive success","Premise of research. Heterospecific pollen deposition on stigmas can impact plant reproduction by decreasing seed set or inducing fruit abortion. Pollinating bats often carry pollen from many species on their fur, and thus bat-pollinated flowers may exhibit tolerance to heterospecific pollen deposition, but to our knowledge this has never been studied. We investigated the relative impact of increasing heterospecific pollen deposition on female reproduction of two sympatric species of Burmeistera that experience pollen transfer between them by their shared bat pollinators. Methodology. We simulated heterospecific pollen deposition by applying pollen mixtures that differed in the ratio of heterospecific to conspecific flowers used to make them (3∶1; 2∶2, and 1∶3) and measured female reproduction by quantifying fruit abortion, seed number, and seed mass. Pivotal results. For Burmeistera borjensis, applying a higher relative amount of heterospecific pollen led to decreased seed production and lighter seed mass, whereas no significant effect of increasing heterospecific pollen was detected in Burmeistera ceratocarpa. Burmeistera borjensis aborted more fruits than B. ceratocarpa (44.1% vs. 18.8%); however, in both species the probability of fruit abortion was not affected by pollination treatment. Conclusions. We detected asymmetric impacts on female reproduction between this pair of sympatric Burmeistera: while increasing heterospecific pollen deposition decreased seed production and seed mass for B. borjensis, it had no detectable effect on B. ceratocarpa. Prior work shows that in nature B. borjensis receives much lower amounts of heterospecific pollen than B. ceratocarpa, and thus results suggest that B. ceratocarpa may have stronger gametic or postzygotic isolating barriers to be able to tolerate heterospecific pollen deposition. Future work should explore how different isolation mechanisms contribute to the asymmetric effects on female reproduction that we report here and whether tolerance to heterospecific pollen deposition is a common response among bat-pollinated plants and other plant taxa relying on low-fidelity pollinators.",,10.1086/705735,,987,"Biology Graduate Student Association, University of New Mexico",,85074688909 (Scopus),10585893,9,995,2019-11-01,,https://doi.org/10.1086/705735,International Journal of Plant Sciences,180

Results suggest that the greatest contributory predictors of crash severity outcomes are driving too fast for conditions, distracted/inattentive driving, overcorrecting and driving under the influence of alcohol. If these circumstances are altered by AV technologies, it is suggested that between 117 and 193 severe crashes involving large trucks could be prevented annually in Missouri alone.

Academic failure due to insufficient cognitive aptitude often contributes to this problematic attrition rate. Thus, cognitive aptitude could be included in admission criteria, as a predictor of academic success and a strategy to minimize attrition. Problem Currently, admissions practices are often incomplete and lack standardization for measuring cognitive aptitude. Approach The Nursing Cognitive Aptitude Model (NCAM) presented in this article is an innovative conceptual model to guide educators in expanding current admissions processes.

However, certain populations may be more susceptible to these effects of depleted self-control capacity. For example, individuals with lower alcohol sensitivity (i.e., requiring more drinks to experience the effects of alcohol) are a high-risk group who are likely to engage in hazardous alcohol use and develop an alcohol use disorder. Those lower in alcohol sensitivity also exhibit heightened motivational reactivity in response to alcohol-related cues, which may be enhanced following exertion of self-control. However, whether drinkers lower in alcohol sensitivity are at higher risk for exhibiting greater motivations toward alcohol-related cues after exerting self-control is unclear. The current research examined the role of alcohol sensitivity in predicting approach motivation following exertion of self-control. It was expected drinkers exerting self-control would exhibit greater orientation toward rewarding cues, particularly after viewing alcohol-related cues. However, we predicted this pattern would be most prominent among drinkers lower in alcohol sensitivity. Experiment 1 supported these hypotheses, with lower alcohol sensitivity predicting greater approach motivation among drinkers required to exert self-control prior to viewing alcohol-related compared to neutral cues. Experiment 2 aimed to replicate these findings by assessing asymmetrical frontal cortical activation, an index of approach motivation. Drinkers with lower alcohol sensitivity exhibited greater relative left frontal cortical activation, consistent with approach motivation, while viewing alcohol-related cues following exertion of self-control.

Using qualitative data collected from a sample of men and women paroled for sexual offenses in Missouri, we contrast how social and structural stigma alter the reentry experiences for participants living in communities along the rural and urban continuum. The results show that the stigma of a sex offense conviction was a near-universal experience and residence restrictions stymied efforts to find housing. Residents of urban areas and some large cities felt that the community offered relative anonymity from stigma but the stress of their status being discovered was omnipresent. Participants in rural areas and small cities had less social privacy and reported being shunned in the community, although strong social ties did mitigate some of the consequences of stigma.

We find substantial experimental and theoretical differences between the linear and branched congeners in terms of fragmentation thresholds, available pathways, and distribution of products. Our calculations predict that the linear substituents initially isomerize to form lower energy branched isomers prior to loss of the alkyl substituents as alkenes. The rate-determining chemistry underlying these related processes is dominated by the ability to stabilize the alkene loss transition structures. This task is more effectively undertaken by branched substituents. Consequently, analyte lability systematically increased with degree of branching (linear < secondary < tertiary). The resulting anthracen-9-ylmethaniminium ion generated from these alkene loss reactions undergoes rate-limiting proton transfer to enable expulsion of either hydrogen cyanide or CNH.

Our analysis provides a robust phylogenomic framework for examining the evolution of green plants. Most inferred species relationships are well supported across multiple species tree and supermatrix analyses, but discordance among plastid and nuclear gene trees at a few important nodes highlights the complexity of plant genome evolution, including polyploidy, periods of rapid speciation, and extinction. Incomplete sorting of ancestral variation, polyploidization and massive expansions of gene families punctuate the evolutionary history of green plants. Notably, we find that large expansions of gene families preceded the origins of green plants, land plants and vascular plants, whereas whole-genome duplications are inferred to have occurred repeatedly throughout the evolution of flowering plants and ferns.

We present evidence that mid spring frosts and summer drought negatively affect the community of insects found on Missouri oaks (Quercus alba and Q. velutina), amounting to a 23–186 fold decrease depending on the oak species, insect body size and feeding guild, and the specific weather event. Depending on the event, spring faunas required 1–5 years and summer faunas 1–4 years following spring frosts to reach pre-event levels. The impact of summer drought on leaf tying caterpillars also lasted over an extended period of time; it was 5 years before numbers of leaf ties reached pre-drought levels. Smaller-bodied species of leaf tying Lepidoptera took longer to recover than larger-bodied species following the drought. Overall, we found no evidence for a general decline in abundance, even a modest one, during the 20 years of study of faunas on oak trees in southeastern Missouri. However, the risk of mid-season frost damage to trees is expected to increase with predicted earlier onset of spring.

Discussing alcohol use with patients can be difficult; dedicated training for health care providers is needed to facilitate these conversations. A Web-based alcohol screening and brief intervention (SBI), comprising didactic and skills application training, was designed for physician assistant students. Objective: This paper details experiences and outcomes in developing an alcohol SBI training curriculum and coordinating virtual encounters with standardized patients. We also explain challenges faced with developing an alcohol SBI training and a Web-based learning management site to fit the needs of 5 different physician assistant programs. Methods: Training development comprised 3 phases-precourse, development, and implementation. The precourse phase included developing the initial training curriculum, building a website, and testing with a pilot group. The development phase refined the training curriculum based on user feedback and moved into a three-component module: didactic training module, guided interactive encounter with a simulated patient, and live encounter with a standardized patient. A learning management system website was also created. In the implementation phase, 5 physician assistant schools incorporated the Web-based training into curricula. Each school modified the implementation method to suit their organizational environment. Evaluation methods included pre- and postchange over time on trainee attitudes, knowledge, and skills (confidence) on talking to patients about alcohol use, trainee self-reported proficiency on the standardized patient encounter, standardized patient evaluation of the trainee proficiency during the alcohol use conversation, user evaluation of the type of technology mode for the standardized patient conversation, and overall trainee satisfaction with the Web-based training on alcohol SBI. Results: Final evaluation outcomes indicated a significant (P<.01) change over time in trainee knowledge and skills (confidence) in the conduct of the alcohol SBI with a standardized patient, regardless of the program implementation method. Trainees were generally satisfied with the Web-based training experience and rated the use of the videoconference medium as most useful when conducting the alcohol SBI conversation with the standardized patient. Training that included a primer on the importance of screening, individual participation in the Web-based didactic alcohol SBI modules, and virtual encounters with standardized patients through a university-based simulation center was the most widely accepted. Successful implementation included program investment and curriculum planning. Implementation barriers involved technical challenges with standardized patient encounters and simulation center logistics, and varying physician assistant school characteristics. Conclusions: Development and implementation of Web-based educational modules to educate health care professionals on alcohol SBI is effective, easy to reproduce, and readily accessible. Identifying challenges affecting development, implementation, and utilization of learned techniques in practice, enhances facilitation of learning and training efficacy. As the value of technology-based learning becomes more apparent, reports detailing what has worked versus what has not may help guide the process.",e11963,10.2196/11963,23687959,,,,85106543896 (Scopus),,10,,2019-10-01,,https://doi.org/10.2196/11963,JMIR Mental Health,6

Towards efficiently provisioning 5G core network slice based on resource and topology attributes,OA,Gold OA,-,-,-,Green Accepted OA,https://doi.org/10.3390/app9204361,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85074206807,"5G core network slice, Network slicing, Resource attributes, Slice provisioning, Topology attributes","Efficient provisioning of 5G network slices is a major challenge for 5G network slicing technology. Previous slice provisioning methods have only considered network resource attributes and ignored network topology attributes. These methods may result in a decrease in the slice acceptance ratio and the slice provisioning revenue. To address these issues, we propose a two-stage heuristic slice provisioning algorithm, called RT-CSP, for the 5G core network by jointly considering network resource attributes and topology attributes in this paper. The first stage of our method is called the slice node provisioning stage, in which we propose an approach to scoring and ranking nodes using network resource attributes (i.e., CPU capacity and bandwidth) and topology attributes (i.e., degree centrality and closeness centrality). Slice nodes are then provisioned according to the node ranking results. In the second stage, called the slice link provisioning stage, the k-shortest path algorithm is implemented to provision slice links. To further improve the performance of RT-CSP, we propose RT-CSP+, which uses our designed strategy, called minMaxBWUtilHops, to select the best physical path to host the slice link. The strategy minimizes the product of the maximum link bandwidth utilization of the candidate physical path and the number of hops in it to avoid creating bottlenecks in the physical path and reduce the bandwidth cost. Using extensive simulations, we compared our results with those of the state-of-the-art algorithms. The experimental results show that our algorithms increase slice acceptance ratio and improve the provisioning revenue-to-cost ratio.",4361,10.3390/app9204361,20763417,,National Science Foundation,1718929,85074206807 (Scopus),,20,,2019-10-01,,https://doi.org/10.3390/app9204361,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),9

In this perspective, it is paramount to highlight physiological mechanisms of plant responses to altitudinal gradients as a proxy to evaluate changing environments. Here, we aimed to determine the impact of elevation on the physiological attributes of two plant species along an altitudinal gradient. Our hypothesis was that the altitudinal gradient influences proline, protein, and sugar contents, as well as abscisic acid (ABA) and indole acetic acid (IAA) concentrations. We studied these physiological components in leaves collected from four different altitudinal ranges in Himalayan region of Pakistan from two native herbs, namely Bistorta affnis and Sibbaldia procumbens. Leaves were collected at the initial blooming phase from each altitudinal range, viz. 2850 m, 3250 m, 3750 m and 4250 m. We observed that most abiotic factors decrease with altitude which induces cold acclimation. A significant increase in the concentration of physiological components was observed as altitude increased, except for IAA, which decreased. Furthermore, we did not find variations in proline, ABA and IAA concentrations between species; only sugar and protein, with higher values for B. affnis. We conclude that altitudinal gradients significantly affect the physiological components of B. affnis and S. procumbens in Himalayan region.

In this context, glycosyl thioimidates have previously been used as efficient donors, in the case of hydrolysis or thioglycoligation. In both cases, the release of the thioimidoyl aglycone was remotely activated through a protonation driven by a carboxylic residue in the active site of the corresponding enzymes. A recombinant glucosidase (DtGly) from Dictyoglomus themophilum, previously used in biocatalysis, was also able to use such glycosyl thioimidates as substrates. Yet, enzymatic kinetic values analysis, coupled to mutagenesis and in silico modelling of DtGly/substrate complexes demonstrated that the release of the thioimidoyl moiety during catalysis is only driven by its leaving group ability, without the activation of a remote protonation.

We used group-based trajectory modeling to identify clusters of children with pHIV after similar developmental trajectories and predictors of belonging to select cognitive trajectory groups. Methods: Participants included children, 4-17 years of age, with pHIV in Thailand and Cambodia. Cognitive measures included translated versions of Intelligence Quotient tests, Color Trails Tests and Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration conducted semiannually over 3-6 years. The best fit of trajectory groups was determined using maximum likelihood estimation. Multivariate logistic regression identified baseline factors associated with belonging to the lowest scoring trajectory group. Results: Group-based trajectory analyses revealed a 3-cluster classification for each cognitive test, labeled as high, medium and low scoring groups. Most trajectory group scores remained stable across age. Verbal IQ declined in all 3 trajectory groups and the high scoring group for Children's Color Trails Test 1 and 2 showed an increase in scores across age. Children in the lowest scoring trajectory group were more likely to present at an older age and report lower household income. Conclusions: Group-based trajectory modeling succinctly classifies cohort heterogeneity in cognitive outcomes in pHIV. Most trajectories remained stable across age suggesting that cognitive potential is likely determined at an early age with the exception of a small subgroup of children who displayed developmental gains in select cognitive domains and may represent those with better cognitive reserve.

We examined whether the frequency of terrestrial activity correlated with study duration (a proxy for sampling effort), rainfall level (a proxy for food availability seasonality), and forest height (a proxy for vertical niche dimension). Terrestrial activity was recorded frequently for Callicebus and Plecturocebus spp., but rarely for Cheracebus spp. Terrestrial resting, anti-predator behavior, geophagy, and playing frequencies in Callicebus and Plecturocebus spp., but feeding and moving differed. Callicebus spp. often ate or searched for new leaves terrestrially. Plecturocebus spp. descended primarily to ingest terrestrial invertebrates and soil. Study duration correlated positively and rainfall level negatively with terrestrial activity. Though differences in sampling effort and methods limited comparisons and interpretation, overall, titi monkeys commonly engaged in a variety of terrestrial activities. Terrestrial behavior in Callicebus and Plecturocebus capacities may bolster resistance to habitat fragmentation. However, it is uncertain if the low frequency of terrestriality recorded for Cheracebus spp. is a genus-specific trait associated with a more basal phylogenetic position, or because studies of this genus occurred in pristine habitats. Observations of terrestrial behavior increased with increasing sampling effort and decreasing food availability.

More recent studies of large antiviral PAs (14–20 rings) active against small DNA tumor viruses lead to questions regarding the extent to which the DNA binding behaviors of the well studied, smaller PAs can be reliably extrapolated to the larger ones. Described here is the first reported study of hairpin PA-DNA binding thermodynamics as a function of PA size (6–20 rings). All PAs exhibit binding affinity in the low nM to upper pM range, which indicates that affinity is not a discriminator of antiviral activity. Unlike the smaller PAs, a 20-ring PA does not appreciably dissociate from DNA in competition experiments, which indicates very long residence time that is consistent with antiviral activity. While the DNA binding thermodynamics for the smaller antivirally inactive 6- and 8-ring PAs is clearly enthalpically driven, the larger antiviral PAs (14- and 20-rings) exhibit strongly entropically-driven DNA binding. These distinct energetic signatures indicate that different types of interactions drive these associations. In DNA binding site stoichiometry experiments conducted at both nM and μM concentrations, all PAs except the 6-ring PA bind an isolated site with site stoichiometry of at least two PAs per recognition sequence. Electrostatic contributions to DNA binding affinity are small for all PAs and not correlated with PA size but weakly correlated with the number of imidazole residues. Altogether, these results indicate that DNA binding behaviors of smaller hairpin PAs do not necessarily reflect those of larger PAs. These are vital considerations in the development of hairpin PAs for biological use.",,10.1016/j.biochi.2019.07.021,61831638,170,National Science Foundation,1337638,85070214322 (Scopus),03009084,,178,2019-10-01,31376420.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2019.07.021,Biochimie,165

They share a volant common ancestor with Procellariiformes close to the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary (66 million years ago) and subsequently lost the ability to fly but enhanced their diving capabilities. With ∼20 species among 6 genera, penguins range from the tropical Galápagos Islands to the oceanic temperate forests of New Zealand, the rocky coastlines of the sub-Antarctic islands, and the sea ice around Antarctica. To inhabit such diverse and extreme environments, penguins evolved many physiological and morphological adaptations. However, they are also highly sensitive to climate change. Therefore, penguins provide an exciting target system for understanding the evolutionary processes of speciation, adaptation, and demography. Genomic data are an emerging resource for addressing questions about such processes. Results: Here we present a novel dataset of 19 high-coverage genomes that, together with 2 previously published genomes, encompass all extant penguin species. We also present a well-supported phylogeny to clarify the relationships among penguins. In contrast to recent studies, our results demonstrate that the genus Aptenodytes is basal and sister to all other extant penguin genera, providing intriguing new insights into the adaptation of penguins to Antarctica. As such, our dataset provides a novel resource for understanding the evolutionary history of penguins as a clade, as well as the fine-scale relationships of individual penguin lineages. Against this background, we introduce a major consortium of international scientists dedicated to studying these genomes. Moreover, we highlight emerging issues regarding ensuring legal and respectful indigenous consultation, particularly for genomic data originating from New Zealand Taonga species.

Here, we combined whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing data to characterize the structure and conservation of sex chromosome systems across Poeciliidae, the livebearing clade that includes guppies. We found that the Poecilia reticulata XY system is much older than previously thought, being shared not only with its sister species, Poecilia wingei, but also with Poecilia picta, which diverged roughly 20 million years ago. Despite the shared ancestry, we uncovered an extreme heterogeneity across these species in the proportion of the sex chromosome with suppressed recombination, and the degree of Y chromosome decay. The sex chromosomes in P. reticulata and P. wingei are largely homomorphic, with recombination in the former persisting over a substantial fraction. However, the sex chromosomes in P. picta are completely nonrecombining and strikingly heteromorphic. Remarkably, the profound degradation of the ancestral Y chromosome in P. picta is counterbalanced by the evolution of functional chromosome-wide dosage compensation in this species, which has not been previously observed in teleost fish.

Sleep impairment in PTSD is associated with severe distress and poorer treatment outcomes. Therefore, specific attention to this symptom of PTSD is warranted and accurate assessment of sleep impairment is critical. The current study investigated the association between self-reported and objective assessment of sleep and sustained attention in women with PTSD. Methods: Study participants include 50 treatment-seeking, female, interpersonal violence survivors who have PTSD. Nocturnal sleep duration was measured with self-report sleep diaries and objective actigraphy assessment over the course of 7 nights. Sustained attention during daytime was measured by the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT). Results: Results indicated that self-reported nocturnal sleep duration, but not objective or global sleep quality measures, best predicted attentional deficits as indicated by lapses and inverse reaction time on the PVT. Daily sleep diaries predicted 19% and 14% of the variance in attentional lapses and inverse reaction time, respectively. Conclusions: In a sample of women with PTSD, self-reported nocturnal sleep duration predicted deficits in sustained attention. Conversely, sleep duration as measured by actigraphy and global sleep quality, did not predict sustained attention. Findings suggest that assessing sleep impairment on a daily basis may provide clinically relevant information in evaluating daytime symptoms and provide guidance in targeting this particularly troublesome symptom in the treatment of PTSD.",,10.5664/jcsm.7930,15509397,1329,National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine,R21AT004079,85072322225 (Scopus),15509389,9,1336,2019-09-15,31538604.0,https://doi.org/10.5664/jcsm.7930,Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine,15

Previous research shows a link between the propensity for aggression in healthy individuals and altered functioning of prefrontal-limbic and default-mode networks (DMN) at rest when no provocation is present. In a pilot study, we used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the effects of pronounced reactive aggression in men, exemplified by IED, on the functional organization of resting-state brain networks including subcortical nodes such as the habenula previously implicated in aggression in preclinical models. Graph theory was applied to resting-state networks to determine alterations in global efficiency and clustering in high reactive aggressive men compared to low reactive aggressive men (controls). Further, we computed within-group correlations between trait aggression and graph measures, as well as within-group whole-brain seed-to-voxel regression analyses between trait aggression and habenula resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC). Reactive aggressive men compared to controls showed higher global efficiency in the left habenula, the left pulvinar in the thalamus, the left dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex, and the right temporal pole, as well as a trend for decreased clustering in DMN nodes. In the reactive aggressive group, high levels of trait aggression were linked to lower global efficiency of the left habenula, and to lower rsFC between the left habenula and the left ventro-lateral prefrontal cortex, a core region involved in inhibitory control. Together with preclinical evidence, our findings in men underline the relevance of aberrant habenula-prefrontal connectivity for the severity of aggressive behavior.

Overly narrow conceptualizations of the EBP model deepened the gap between practice knowledge and formal research evidence in the profession.

This paper reports findings from an exploratory survey about the sources and content of knowledge that changed professional practice among social work field instructors (n=250) in St. Louis. An analysis of open-ended responses revealed that co-workers and continuing education programs are the most important sources for knowledge and information that influence practice. While academic journals are perceived by practitioners to be relatively unimportant sources for such knowledge, research findings on the background and effectiveness of interventions, make up the primary content that appears to affect social work practice. The findings suggest that formal research knowledge is important but that it is primarily accessed through professional networks and training programs instead of directly from peer-reviewed journals. Social media platforms seemed to be insignificant sources for professional knowledge. These insights raise important questions about how social workers use social media and the role of occupational networks and associations for the dissemination of research findings.

BicMix and Cross-Conditions Cluster Detection algorithms were applied to detect modules based on co-expression relationships across all the tissues. Soybean context-specific interactomes were predicted by combining soybean tissue gene expression and protein–protein interaction data. Functional analyses of these predicted networks provide insights into soybean tissue specificities. For example, under symbiotic, nitrogen-fixing conditions, the constructed soybean leaf network highlights the connection between the photosynthesis function and rhizobium–legume symbiosis. SoyCSN data and all its results are publicly available via an interactive web service within the Soybean Knowledge Base (SoyKB) at http://soykb.org/SoyCSN. SoyCSN provides a useful web-based access for exploring context specificities systematically in gene regulatory mechanisms and gene relationships for soybean researchers and molecular breeders.",e00167,10.1002/pld3.167,24754455,,National Science Foundation,-1546873,85073249000 (Scopus),,9,,2019-09-01,,https://doi.org/10.1002/pld3.167,Plant Direct,3

We found that Veterans with mild traumatic brain injury (n = 93,003) and no brain injury (n = 434,378) were mean age of 32.0 (SD 9.21) on entering Department of Veterans Health Administration care, were predominantly Caucasian non-Hispanic (64.69%), and served in the Army (61.31%). Latent class analysis revealed five phenotypes in each subcohort; Moderately Healthy and Mental Health phenotypes were common to both. The Healthy phenotype was found only in no brain injury. Unique phenotypes in mild traumatic brain injury included Moderately Healthy+Decline, Polytrauma, and Polytrauma+Improvement. There was substantial variation in adverse outcomes. The Polytrauma+Improvement phenotype had the lowest likelihood of adverse outcomes. There were no differences between Moderately Healthy+Decline and Polytrauma phenotypes. Phenotypes of comorbidity vary significantly by traumatic brain injury status including divergence in phenotypes (and outcomes) over time in the mild traumatic brain injury subcohort. Understanding risk factors for the divergence between Polytrauma vs. Polytrauma+Improvement and Moderately Healthy vs. Moderately Healthy+Decline, will improve our ability to proactively mitigate risk, better understand the early patterns of comorbidity that are associated with neurodegenerative sequelae following mild traumatic brain injury, and plan more patient-centered care.",e0222674,10.1371/journal.pone.0222674,19326203,,U.S. Department of Defense,W81XWH-13-2-0095-04,85072521032 (Scopus),,9,,2019-09-01,31539410.0,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0222674,PLoS ONE,14

PAleon was sensitive enough to monitor physiological concentrations of PA in living cells and to visualize PA dynamics at subcellular resolution in tissues when they were challenged with abscisic acid (ABA) and salt stress. PAleon bioimaging revealed kinetics and tissue specificity of salt stress-triggered PA accumulation. Compared with wild-type Arabidopsis, the pldα1 mutant lacking phospholipase Dα1 (PLDα1) for PA generation showed delayed and reduced PA accumulation. Comparative analysis of wild type and pldα1 mutant indicated that cellular pH-modulated PA interaction with target proteins and PLD/PA-mediated salt tolerance.

Traffic offloading from macrocells to small cells is envisioned as a potential solution to improve energy efficiency in 5G heterogeneous networks. However, traffic offloading causes traffic congestion at small cells, interference as a result of small cells transmissions, and aggregate power consumption of small cells. These factors make the traffic offloading procedure more challenging. In this paper, we propose a conditional traffic offloading scheme, which relies on macrocells and small cells system load information to determine the most energy efficient traffic offloading strategy, select the proper operation mode of small cells, and fulfill macro users applications' quality of service (QoS) requirements. The proposed scheme is developed using a novel intuitive online reinforcement learning methodology to perform the conditional traffic offloading in which each macro BS conjectures the offloading strategies of other macrocells. The convergence of the proposed scheme is proved and numerical results demonstrate its capability to achieve fast convergence with QoS guarantee and significant energy efficiency.",8713902,10.1109/TGCN.2019.2916900,24732400,691,,,85071328978 (Scopus),,3,702,2019-09-01,,https://doi.org/10.1109/TGCN.2019.2916900,IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking,3

Methods: By examining the intersections among gender, disability, and life-course criminology, the proposed model will explain how men reconstruct their disabled masculine identity following VAI. Results: In doing so, I argue that these ‘new’ identities following VAI can facilitate persistence in offending or desistance from crime.

In his review on the spectroscopy of the 3d transition metal oxides (Merer, 1989), Anthony Merer summarized the available experimental data for CuO, which encompassed over 20 publications. There have been 4 subsequent publications on CuO that have included: high resolution Fourier-Transform emission spectroscopy (FTS) (O'Brien et al., 1996), mm- and sub-mm microwave absorption spectroscopy (Steimle et al., 1997), moderate resolution laser induced fluorescence (LIF) spectroscopy (Jin et al., 2002), and high-resolution molecular beam LIF spectroscopy, both in the presence and absence of an external electric field (Zhuang et al., 2010). Despite this extensive study, analyses of spectra have been restricted to 63CuO, even though the natural abundance of 65Cu is significant (63Cu:65Cu is 69%:31%). Additionally, the Λ-doubling parameter for the X 2Πi state of CuO is assigned a negative sign in the FTS analysis, but is assigned a positive sign in the microwave and molecular beam LIF analyses. In this study, high resolution spectra for (0,0) and (1,1) bands of the [16.3] A 2Σ− – X 2Πi transition of CuO have been recorded using intracavity laser absorption spectroscopy (ILS). Features due to the (0,0) band of 65CuO were clearly identified in the spectra and included in the analysis. The CuO FTS spectrum was retrieved from the archive for the McMath-Pierce Solar Observatory at Kitt Peak, and several additional vibrational bands of the [7.7] Y 2Σ+ – X 2Πi transition of CuO were identified in the FTS data, including the (1,0), (0,0), and (0,1) bands of 65CuO. The ILS, FTS, microwave and molecular beam LIF data were simultaneously fit to a mass-independent Dunham type Hamiltonian using PGOPHER. In total, 13,019 observations were fit to 1 constrained and 46 floated parameters. The results of this simultaneous fit show a Cu-isotope dependent shift in electronic energy for the [7.7] Y 2Σ+ – X 2Πi and [16.3] A 2Σ− – X 2Πi transitions of CuO. The results also confirm that the sign of q in the X 2Πi ground state is negative. Potential energy curves were generated from the molecular constants obtained in the fit for the [7.7] Y 2Σ+ and X 2Πi states using the RKR method. These potential energy curves are significantly different and clearly indicate the Y and X state do not form a pure-precession pair.",111173,10.1016/j.jms.2019.111173,1096083X,,National Science Foundation,CHE-1566442,85070101906 (Scopus),00222852,,,2019-09-01,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jms.2019.111173,Journal of Molecular Spectroscopy,363

Methods: In 2018, we conducted a cross-sectional assessment of 3908 ACHD recruited from 24 ACHD-specialized centers in 15 countries between April 2013 to March 2015. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used to assess self-reported depressive symptoms and the Health-Behavior Scale-Congenital Heart Disease was used to collect PA information. Cochran-Armitage tests were performed to assess trends between depressive symptom levels and PA participation. Chi-Square and Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests were utilized to examine relations between depressive symptom levels and patient characteristics. Stepwise multivariable models were then constructed to understand the independent impact of PA on depressive symptoms. Results: The overall prevalence of elevated depressive symptoms in this sample was 12% with significant differences in rates between countries (p <.001). Physically active individuals were less likely to be depressed than those who were sedentary. Of the 2 PA domains examined, sport participation rather than active commute was significantly associated with reduced symptoms of depression.

Certain drivers of these declines are known; however, less is known about the interspecific trait differences that make certain species more susceptible to decline. Two traits that have implications for responding to rapidly changed environments may be particularly consequential for bumble bee populations: intraspecific body size variation and brain size. Bumble bee body size is highly variable and is likely adaptive at the colony level, and brain size correlates with cognitive traits (e.g., behavioral plastic-ity) in many groups. Trait variation and plasticity may buffer species against negative effects of rapidly changed environments. Using phylogenetically controlled analyses of 31 North American bumble bee species, we find that higher intraspecific body size variation is associated with species having increased their relative abundance over time. However, this variation does not significantly interact with tongue length, another trait thought to influence bees’ decline susceptibility. Head size, a proxy for brain size, is not correlated with change in relative abundance. Our results support the hypothesis that variation in body size makes species less susceptible to decline in rapidly altered environments and suggests that this variation is important to the success of bumble bee populations.",,10.1086/704280,,381,Whitney R.

Metabolic alterations in the enoyl-coA hydratase 2 mutant disrupt peroxisomal pathways in seedlings,OA,-,-,Bronze OA,Green Final OA,-,https://doi.org/10.1104/pp.19.00300,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85070848865,,"Mobilization of seed storage compounds, such as starch and oil, is required to provide energy and metabolic building blocks during seedling development. Over 50% of fatty acids in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seed oil have a cis-double bond on an even-numbered carbon. Degradation of these substrates requires peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidation plus additional enzyme activities. Such auxiliary enzymes, including the enoyl-CoA hydratase ECH2, convert (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA intermediates to the core β-oxidation substrate (S)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA. ECH2 was suggested to function in the peroxisomal conversion of indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) to indole-3-acetic acid, because ech2 seedlings have altered IBA responses. The underlying mechanism connecting ECH2 activity and IBA metabolism is unclear. Here, we show that ech2 seedlings have reduced root length, smaller cotyledons, and arrested pavement cell expansion. At the cellular level, reduced oil body mobilization and enlarged peroxisomes suggest compromised β-oxidation. ech2 seedlings accumulate 3-hydroxyoctenoate (C8:1-OH) and 3-hydroxyoctanoate (C8:0-OH), putative hydrolysis products of catabolic intermediates for α-linolenic acid and linoleic acid, respectively. Wild-type seedlings treated with 3-hydroxyoctanoate have ech2-like growth defects and altered IBA responses. ech2 phenotypes are not rescued by Suc or auxin application. However, ech2 phenotypes are suppressed in combination with the core β-oxidation mutants mfp2 or ped1, and ech2 mfp2 seedlings accumulate less C8:1-OH and C8:0-OH than ech2 seedlings. These results indicate that ech2 phenotypes require efficient core β-oxidation. Our findings suggest that low ECH2 activity causes metabolic alterations through a toxic effect of the accumulating intermediates. These effects manifest in altered lipid metabolism and IBA responses leading to disrupted seedling development.",,10.1104/pp.19.00300,15322548,1860,National Institutes of Health,R15GM116090,85070848865 (Scopus),00320889,4,1876,2019-08-01,31138624.0,https://doi.org/10.1104/pp.19.00300,Plant Physiology,180

The wet season triggers the start of breeding for many Neotropical birds but also alters the antigenic environment, likely increasing the risk of disease transmission. We explored 2 hypotheses about temporal variation in constitutive innate immunity of a Neotropical bird, the House Wren (Troglodytes aedon). The antigen response hypothesis proposes that Neotropical wrens upregulate their immune function in the wet season either in anticipation of or in response to vectors that become more prevalent. The resource constraint hypothesis proposes that during periods of putative high resource demand, such as when parents are feeding young, immune function should be compromised and downregulated. Controlling for reproductive stage, we found that microbicidal capacity of blood against Escherichia coli was higher in the wet than the dry season, consistent with the antigen response hypothesis. Phagocytosis of E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus did not differ between wet and dry seasons.

AFT-MS has been applied to quantitating certain explosives by selective clustering with nitrate and more recently applied to detecting tributyl phosphate and dimethyl methylphosphonate as protonated species. Developing AFT-MS methods for organophosphorus species is appealing, given that this class of compounds includes a range of pollutants, chemical warfare agent (CWA) simulants, and CWA degradation products. A key aspect of targeting organophosphorus analytes has included the use of dopant ion chemistry to form adducts that impart additional analytical selectivity. The assessment of potential dopant molecules suited to enhance detection of these compounds is hindered by few published ion thermochemical properties for organophosphorus species, such as proton affinity, which can be used for approximating proton-bound dimer bond strength. As a preliminary investigation for the progression of sensing methods involving AFT-MS, we have applied both the extended kinetic method and computational approaches to eight organophosphorus CWA simulants to determine their respective gas-phase proton affinities.

Methods: This Perspective describes the four principles of Med First, which are based on evidence-based guidelines. It draws conceptual comparisons between the Housing First approach to chronic homelessness and the Med First approach to pharmacotherapy for OUD, and compares state certification standards for substance use disorder (SUD) treatment (the traditional approach) to Med First guidelines for OUD treatment. Finally, the Perspective details how Med First principles have been practically implemented. Results: Med First principles emphasize timely access to maintenance pharmacotherapy without requiring psychosocial services or discontinuation for any reason other than harm to the client. Early results regarding medication utilization and treatment retention are promising. Feedback from providers has been largely favorable, though clinical- and system-level obstacles to effective OUD treatment remain.

In this article, a detailed historical modeling of the Mycenaean state of Pylos based on new data from the systematic excavation of Iklaina tests the current model and proposes that the Pylian state, as it is known to us from Linear B tablets, was not integrated until an advanced phase of the Late Helladic IIIB period. This analysis suggests that for most of the Mycenaean period both Iklaina and Ano Englianos were primary centers following parallel trajectories and functioning as capitals of independent micropolities.

We assess the distribution of genetic diversity in the partial Domain I of apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) in three mtDNA-defined lineages of avian Plasmodium to determine spatial population structure and host–parasite genetic relationships. We find that one parasite lineage is genetically differentiated in association with a single host genus and among some locations, but not with respect to other hosts. Two other parasite lineages are undifferentiated with respect to host species but exhibit geographic differentiation that is inconsistent with shared geographic barriers or with isolation-by-distance. Additional differentiation within two other lineages is unassociated with host species or location; in one case, we tentatively interpret this differentiation as the result of mitochondrial introgression from one of the lineages into a second lineage. More sampling of nuclear genetic diversity within populations of avian Plasmodium is needed to rule out coinfection as a possible confounding factor. If coinfections are not responsible for these findings, further assessment is needed to determine the frequency of mitonuclear discordance and its implications for defining parasite lineages based on mitochondrial genetic variation.

Methods: The agency, comprising 90 employees serving more than 10 000 persons annually, received federal funding to raise awareness about trafficking and to identify and support persons who are at risk for trafficking through training, coalition building, direct outreach and service, and case management. We, the authors, counted the numbers of tips and potential victims reported to the agency by year, type of trafficking, economic sector, sex, region of origin, and age and looked for new risk factors for trafficking. Results: Data were available for 213 tips received from September 1, 2008, through June 30, 2017, and for 82 potential victims identified from July 1, 2011, through June 30, 2017. Labor trafficking (126 tips, 57 potential victims) was more common than sex trafficking (59 tips, 17 potential victims). The number of tips varied during the study period. Tips and potential victims were diverse and included male and female children and adults. Most victims were from Mexico (n = 68), the United States (n = 47), Asia (n = 31), and Central and South America (n = 23). Potential victims were exploited in several industries including agriculture, construction, commercial sex, and landscaping.

Background: Perceptions of the effects of human migration are major drivers of country attitudes, policies, and programs. Increasingly complex global interconnectedness has altered relationships among sending, receiving, and transit countries. The Global North, with its aging and declining populations, requires a healthy and young workforce; the Global South, with limited resources, a high birthrate, and an overall youthful population, can fill the gaps of the former, but with several implications for receiving and sending nations. Methods and results: This article reviews literature and data on current migration worldwide, with particular emphasis on immigration. Despite the complexities of human migration and extant theories that dissect the phenomenon, the fundamental elements of Lee's early push-and-pull theory of migration continue to hold true. Generally, people are drawn to improved opportunities or leave challenging environments, whether temporarily or permanently. Two salient dimensions undergird the study of migration: (1) migration trends—who migrates and why, and the size and direction of migration flows; and (2) the impact of migration—how migration changes receiving, transit, and sending countries. Receiving/transit nations are particularly apprehensive about whether immigrants fill their needs and how they impact resources. They speculate about immigrant preparedness for the workforce, ability to integrate into the society, and consequences for the racial/phenotypic profile of the nation. Immigrants also experience these worries. Conclusions: Ethnicity, which is associated with common ancestry and culture, including language, religion, traditions, and behavioral norms, often contributes to, and challenges, a receiving nation's world view. This can have implications for several segments of its society, including the health profession, which could find that in the delivery of services it must grapple with the complex relationship between migrant, health, and health services utilization.",,10.1016/j.puhe.2019.04.011,14765616,135,,,85067361922 (Scopus),00333506,,142,2019-07-01,31229257.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2019.04.011,Public Health,172

The sample consisted of 177 Fontan patients (Mage = 27.5 ± 7.6 years, 52% male)who reported their physical activity, perceived health status, and QOL as part of the cross-sectional Assessment of Patterns of Patient-Reported Outcomes in Adults with Congenital Heart disease – International Study. Descriptive statistics and univariate analyses of variance with planned contrasts were computed to describe physical activity characteristics. Mediation analyses tested whether perceived health status variables mediated the association between physical activity and QOL. Forty-six percent of patients were sedentary while only 40% met international physical activity guidelines. Higher physical activity was associated with younger age, lower NYHA class, higher perceived general health, and greater QOL. Patients who commuted by walking and engaged in sports reported better perceived health and QOL. Mediation analyses revealed that perceived general health but not NYHA functional class mediated the association between physical activity and QOL (αβ = 0.22, 95% confidence interval = 0.04 to 0.49).

Intra-individual variation includes behavioral responses to changing environmental conditions and hence behavioral plasticity in the context of novel or variable conditions. Inter-individual variation determines the degree of variation on which selection can act and the rate of evolutionary responses to changes in average and extreme environmental conditions. Here we focus on variation in the partial migratory behavior of giant Galápagos tortoises (Chelonoidis spp.) and its energetic consequences. We evaluate the extent and mechanisms by which tortoises adjust migration timing in response to varying annual environmental conditions, and integrate movement data within a bioenergetic model of tortoise migration to quantify the fitness consequences of migration timing. We find strong inter-individual variation in the timing of migration, which was not affected by environmental conditions prevailing at the time of migration but rather by average expectations estimated from multi-annual averaged conditions. This variation is associated with an average annual loss in efficiency of ~15% relative to optimal timing based on year-specific conditions. These results point towards a limited ability of tortoises to adjust the timing of their migrations based on prevailing (and, by extension, future) conditions, suggesting that the adaptability of tortoise migratory behavior to changing conditions is predicated more by past “normal” conditions than responses to prevailing, changing conditions.

Methods: The study uses a repeated cross-sectional design with five years of data (2011–2015)from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)in the US. The difference-in-difference approach is applied to compare individuals with and without disabilities regarding their food security status in adolescence and young adulthood. Instrumental Variable analyses are conducted using state SNAP policy rules as exogenous instruments to estimate the effects of SNAP participation on food security status for youth and young adults with disabilities. Results: Results indicate that transition into adulthood results in greater food security for individuals without disabilities but an increased risk of low food security for individuals with disabilities. The increased risk for young adults with disabilities may well put them at very low food security, the most severe category on the food security scale. SNAP participation appears to have greater impacts for youth than for young adults. Conclusions: Since food security likely has a profound impact on the long-term development, economic independence, and self-sufficiency, we discuss a few policy strategies that may help individuals with disabilities in their transition to adulthood.",,10.1016/j.adolescence.2019.04.002,10959254,63,U.S. Department of Agriculture,58-5000-1-0050,85064643350 (Scopus),01401971,,72,2019-06-01,31035208.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adolescence.2019.04.002,Journal of Adolescence,73

On one hand, IoT devices are 'weak' and need external assistance. Edge computing provides a promising direction addressing the deficiency of centralized cloud computing in scaling massive number of devices. On the other hand, IoT devices are also relatively 'vulnerable' facing malicious hackers due to resource constraints. The emerging blockchain and smart contracts technologies bring a series of new security features for IoT and edge computing. In this paper, to address the challenges, we design and prototype an edge-IoT framework named 'EdgeChain' based on blockchain and smart contracts. The core idea is to integrate a permissioned blockchain and the internal currency or 'coin' system to link the edge cloud resource pool with each IoT device' account and resource usage, and hence behavior of the IoT devices. EdgeChain uses a credit-based resource management system to control how much resource IoT devices can obtain from edge servers, based on predefined rules on priority, application types, and past behaviors. Smart contracts are used to enforce the rules and policies to regulate the IoT device behavior in a nondeniable and automated manner. All the IoT activities and transactions are recorded into blockchain for secure data logging and auditing. We implement an EdgeChain prototype and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the ideas. The results show that while gaining the security benefits of blockchain and smart contracts, the cost of integrating them into EdgeChain is within a reasonable and acceptable range.",8510796,10.1109/JIOT.2018.2878154,23274662,4719,National Aeronautics and Space Administration,NNX15AK38A,85055703077 (Scopus),,3,4732,2019-06-01,,https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2018.2878154,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,6

Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) genes play a role in parasite detection as part of the innate immune system whereas Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) genes encode proteins that display antigens as part of the vertebrate adaptive immune system. Thus, both gene families are under selection pressure from pathogens. The bananaquit (Coereba flaveola) is a passerine bird that is a common host of avian malarial parasites (Plasmodium sp. and Haemoproteus sp.). We assessed molecular variation of TLR and MHC genes in a wild population of bananaquits and identified allelic associations with resistance/susceptibility to parasitic infection to address hypotheses of avian immune response to haemosporidian parasites. Results: We found that allele frequencies are associated with infection status at the immune loci studied. A consistent general trend showed the infected groups possessed more alleles at lower frequencies, and exhibited unique alleles, compared to the uninfected group.

Characterizing the global distribution of these symbioses and identifying the factors that control this distribution are thus integral to understanding the present and future functioning of forest ecosystems. Here we generate a spatially explicit global map of the symbiotic status of forests, using a database of over 1.1 million forest inventory plots that collectively contain over 28,000 tree species. Our analyses indicate that climate variables—in particular, climatically controlled variation in the rate of decomposition—are the primary drivers of the global distribution of major symbioses. We estimate that ectomycorrhizal trees, which represent only 2% of all plant species7, constitute approximately 60% of tree stems on Earth. Ectomycorrhizal symbiosis dominates forests in which seasonally cold and dry climates inhibit decomposition, and is the predominant form of symbiosis at high latitudes and elevation. By contrast, arbuscular mycorrhizal trees dominate in aseasonal, warm tropical forests, and occur with ectomycorrhizal trees in temperate biomes in which seasonally warm-and-wet climates enhance decomposition. Continental transitions between forests dominated by ectomycorrhizal or arbuscular mycorrhizal trees occur relatively abruptly along climate-driven decomposition gradients; these transitions are probably caused by positive feedback effects between plants and microorganisms. Symbiotic nitrogen fixers—which are insensitive to climatic controls on decomposition (compared with mycorrhizal fungi)—are most abundant in arid biomes with alkaline soils and high maximum temperatures. The climatically driven global symbiosis gradient that we document provides a spatially explicit quantitative understanding of microbial symbioses at the global scale, and demonstrates the critical role of microbial mutualisms in shaping the distribution of plant species.",,10.1038/s41586-019-1128-0,14764687,404,Natural Environment Research Council,NE/I02982X/1,85065790614 (Scopus),00280836,7756,408,2019-05-16,31092941.0,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1128-0,Nature,569

Such competition can select for divergence in floral traits that attract pollinators or determine pollen placement. While most species in Centropogon (Campanulaceae: Lobelioideae) have flowers that suggest adaptation to bat or hummingbird pollination, actual pollinators are rarely documented, and a few species have a mix of traits from both pollination syndromes. We studied the pollination biology of a “mixed-syndrome” species and its co-occurring congeners to examine the relationship between floral traits and visitation patterns for Centropogon. Methods: Fieldwork at two sites in Bolivian cloud forests involved filming floral visitors, quantifying pollen transfer, and measuring floral traits. Stamen exsertion, which determines pollen placement, was measured from herbarium specimens across the geographic range of these species to test for character displacement. Results: Results show a generalization gradient, from primarily bat pollination in white-flowered Centropogon incanus, to bat pollination with secondary hummingbird pollination in the cream-flowered C. brittonianus, to equal reliance on both pollinators in the red-flowered, mixed-syndrome C. mandonis. Pollen transfer between these species is further reduced by differences in stamen exsertion that are accentuated in zones of sympatry, a pattern consistent with character displacement. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that key differences in floral color and shape mediate a gradient of specialization in Bolivian Centropogon. Interspecific pollen transfer is further reduced by potential character displacement of a key trait.

Despite these examples, adding two waves does not always create a new wave at the beat frequency-a heterodyne wave. A heterodyne wave is, however, created only when the wave amplitudes combine nonlinearly. The resulting heterodyne wave can be identified because it is an additive term at a new frequency in the output waveform.

In this paper we describe a new approach to calculations of the Custom Correlation Coefficient (CCC) between Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) across a population, suitable for parallel systems equipped with graphics processing units (GPUs) or Intel Xeon Phi processors. We describe the mapping of the algorithms to accelerated processors, techniques used for eliminating redundant calculations due to symmetries, and strategies for efficient mapping of the calculations to many-node parallel systems. Results are presented demonstrating high per-node performance and near-ideal parallel scalability with rates of more than nine quadrillion (9 × 10 15 ) elementwise comparisons achieved per second with the latest optimized code on the ORNL Titan system, this being orders of magnitude faster than rates achieved using other codes and platforms as reported in the literature. Also it is estimated that as many as 90 quadrillion (90 × 10 15 ) comparisons per second may be achievable on the upcoming ORNL Summit system, an additional 10X performance increase.

Two experiments examined the asymmetric effects of evaluative conditioning (EC) on cognitions underlying HED in a nonclinical, student sample. Based on the associative-propositional evaluation (APE) model, we predicted that negative EC would result in stronger implicit alcohol avoidance motivation compared to neutral EC but would not impact explicit alcohol expectancies; further, we hypothesized stronger negative EC effects among students reporting HED compared to light drinkers. Experiment 1 supported these hypotheses. In Experiment 2, participants were required to focus on either feelings or knowledge about alcohol following EC. Replicating Experiment 1, negative EC was effective in promoting implicit alcohol avoidance motivation among students reporting HED compared to neutral EC, whereas no differences in explicit alcohol expectations or urges emerged. However, greater implicit alcohol avoidance predicted lower explicit alcohol urges among participants instructed to focus on alcohol-related feelings, but not alcohol-related knowledge, regardless of condition. Findings suggest students reporting HED, but not light drinkers, may exhibit implicit alcohol avoidance following negative EC and that instructions to focus on alcohol-related feelings may align explicit and implicit responses.

Less is known about the role of personal encounters with police. We explore this issue by specifying associations between reporting intentions and type of contact (involuntary/voluntary), scope (cumulative/recent), and appraisal (respect/satisfaction with last encounter). Methods: This study draws on surveys of young adults in New York City (N = 508) and uses structural equation modeling to examine correlates of crime reporting intentions. Results: Respondents with more stops are less willing to report, and this effect is both direct and indirect, operating primarily via legitimacy. The association between reporting intentions and variety of voluntary contacts is direct and positive. Negative appraisals of recent stops are associated with lower reporting intentions but only indirectly; feelings of disrespect in recent stops are mediated by perceptions of legitimacy. Dissatisfaction with a recent voluntary contact is related to negative views of police effectiveness, but effectiveness does not shape reporting intentions. Instead, disrespectful voluntary contact has a direct negative relationship with reporting attitudes. Conclusion: The results underscore the importance of better-specifying contact with the police, as reporting intentions and related perceptions of law enforcement vary across experience and appraisal mechanisms.",,10.1177/0022427818817338,1552731X,412,,,85059696261 (Scopus),00224278,3,450,2019-05-01,,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022427818817338,Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency,56

Pre-intervention research has established methods of influencing alcohol cognition and reducing short-term alcohol consumption among students using evaluative conditioning (EC), repeatedly pairing alcohol with emotionally valenced images. Specifically, negative EC promotes negative attitudes toward alcohol, but additional research is needed to understand the range of EC effects and conditions under which it is or is not effective. For example, whether pairing alcohol with positive images promotes positive alcohol attitudes has not been tested. Further, drinking motives may influence the effectiveness of conditioning alcohol attitudes, since these motives are strongly associated with emotional stimuli like those presented in EC. The current experiment tested the interaction of drinking motives (coping and enhancement) and EC valence (negative or positive) on implicit alcohol avoidance. Participants (N = 95) were undergraduate students reporting active alcohol use. Results indicated no main effect of EC condition on implicit alcohol avoidance. However, drinking motives interacted with EC procedures assigned to participants. Those reporting greater coping motives exhibited less implicit alcohol avoidance following negative EC, whereas those reporting greater enhancement motives exhibited less alcohol avoidance following positive EC. Findings indicate drinking motives may influence the effectiveness of EC for altering alcohol attitudes. Negative EC did not promote alcohol avoidance among college students reporting higher coping motives, and positive EC only reduced avoidance among students reporting higher enhancement motives.

In the current paper, we utilize the advantages of EMD and linear TFA to propose a new signal reconstruction method, called the empirical signal separation algorithm. First we represent the signal with STFT or WT. After that, by using an EMD-like procedure, we extract the components in the time-frequency (TF) plane one by one, adaptively and automatically. With the iterations carried out in the sifting process, the proposed method can separate non-stationary multicomponent signals with fast varying frequency components which EMD may not be able to separate.

The imaging and neuropsychological data from 135 post-deployed United States Service Members from two groups (mTBI and orthopedic injured) were examined. Two shape features modeling local deformations in thickness (RD) and surface area (JD) were defined vertex-wise on parametric mesh-representations of 7 bilateral subcortical gray matter structures. Linear regression was used to model associations between subcortical morphometry and neuropsychological performance as a function of either TBI status or, among TBI patients, subjective reporting of initial concussion severity (CS). Results demonstrated several significant group-by-cognition relationships with shape metrics across multiple cognitive domains including processing speed, memory, and executive function. Higher processing speed was robustly associated with more dilation of caudate surface area among patients with mTBI who reported more than one CS variables (loss of consciousness (LOC), alteration of consciousness (AOC), and/or post-traumatic amnesia (PTA)).

Part of the problem is the small number of radiocarbon dates from Mycenaean sites. In this article, we publish a set of 15 new AMS radiocarbon dates from the Mycenaean site of Iklaina, in southwestern Greece. The resulting date ranges allow us to establish an absolute chronology for major stages in the life of the Iklaina settlement and the associated relative chronology based on ceramic phases. In general, the Iklaina dates show a better fit with the High Chronology for the early Mycenaean period. Specifically, the transition from the Middle to Late Helladic, at the beginning of the Mycenaean period, is placed between the end of the 19th c. and the beginning of the 17th c. BC. The LH II period, when large-scale architecture appears at Iklaina for the first time, spans the 17th century BC and the LH IIIA1 period goes into the 15th century. None of the analyzed samples were recovered from secure LH IIIA2 deposits, so they do not affect the chronology of this period. However, the samples from the destruction of the monumental buildings, which ceramically is placed in the LH IIIB period, provide a general latest use date in the 13th century. Given the possibility that this destruction marks the annexation of Iklaina by the Palace of Nestor and the unification of the Pylian state, this becomes an important chronological marker for the formation of this state.

These processes might be connected if conditions that favor the proliferation of species, such as release from competitors, facilitate the evolution of novel ecological relationships. Despite this, phylogenetic studies do not consistently identify such a connection. Conversely, if higher diversity caused species to become increasingly specialized ecologically, then lineage diversification might become dissociated from ecological diversification. In this analysis, we ask whether the rate of lineage diversification in a large clade of birds is correlated with morphological specialization and with rates of morphological evolution. We find that morphological variation is related to species richness within clades but that rates of morphological evolution are decoupled from the rate of lineage diversification. Additionally, morphological specialization within lineages is independent of the rate at which lineages diversify, with the results apparently robust against false negative inference. This dissociation is likely a consequence of the major ecomorphological differences between avian clades arising early in their evolutionary history, with comparatively little variation added subsequently, while avian diversification has been driven predominantly by geographic isolation and sexual selection.

Our study demonstrated group-level priming effects on the N200 and N400, with both components being primarily modulated by unpronounceable, orthographically illegal primes. Relationships between the extent of priming as indexed by N200 amplitude and speed of orthographic processing emerged, as reaction time (RT) on an orthographic choice task was associated with priming effects. Priming effects on N400 amplitude were related to phonological decoding efficiency.

We identify circumstances in which either kind of psychological altruism provides the most adaptive solution to the helper’s decision problem. As a result, we show that both kinds of psychological altruism are likely to be instantiated and selected for.",,10.1007/s40806-018-0167-3,21989885,58,Division of Social and Economic Sciences,SES-1654982,85082080226 (Scopus),,1,70,2019-03-15,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40806-018-0167-3,Evolutionary Psychological Science,5

Information available can be inherited from the past or gathered from the present. Therefore, animals must balance inherited biases with new information that may be in conflict with those potential biases. In our study, we set up color pairings such that an arbitrarily chosen focal color, human-orange, would result in an inherent bias in comparison to 3 other colors tested resulting in equal, medium, and strong preference differences. We chose color pairings through a series of preferences tests across 8 colonies of bumble bees. We subsequently used these pairings with rewards that varied in quality (good or bad states) and consistency (steady and fluctuating) in order to investigate how inherited biases affect the foraging choices of bumble bees when new information is gathered. We found that the preexisting color biases within our bees were only maintained when the reward associated with those colors was steady, even if paired with mediocre sugar concentrations. When maintained, we observed that other aspects of bee choice also reflected this bias, including increased sampling for the preferred color and an increased likelihood of choosing that color in a subsequent choice. Thus, environmental change and reward differences interact with the level of preexisting bias to determine whether inherited information is more heavily weighted than newly gathered information, and even a strong preexisting bias can be quickly erased with experience under some conditions.",,10.1093/beheco/ary140,14657279,150,,,85062805853 (Scopus),10452249,1,158,2019-03-04,,https://doi.org/10.1093/beheco/ary140,Behavioral Ecology,30

This study examines how maternal depressive symptoms and stress in the NICU are related to parenting behaviors at age 5 years, in mothers of children born very preterm (at ≤30 weeks’ gestation). Method: This longitudinal study followed a diverse sample of 74 very preterm children and their mothers. Maternal depression and stress were assessed in the NICU. At age 5, mother−child dyads were observed and coded for maternal intrusiveness, negativity, sensitivity, and positivity. Other covariates, including maternal and child intelligence, maternal education, income-to-needs ratio, maternal depression at age 5 years, and child sex were included in multivariate analyses. Results: The interaction between maternal NICU stress and NICU depression for intrusiveness and negativity indicates that greater NICU depression was associated with more intrusiveness under medium or high levels of NICU stress, and more negativity under high levels of NICU stress. Furthermore, greater NICU depression was associated with less sensitivity, over and above other covariates.

Originally operationalized as the combination of social cohesion and informal social control, collective efficacy theory is a predictor of multiple positive outcomes. Conceptual and empirical critiques of collective efficacy theory suggest that social cohesion and informal social control should be modeled as unique constructs. Further, the current model of collective efficacy theory does not include an explicit measure of efficacy. Mutual efficacy, defined as community members’ beliefs that collective action will be successful at attaining group goals, will be developed in this manuscript. The purpose of mutual efficacy was to make efficacy an explicit component within collective efficacy theory.

To capture periodic mandatory disclosures, we use earnings quality measures derived from the literature. Consistent with endogenous relations predicted by theory, we find that voluntary disclosure and both types of mandatory disclosure are correlated, although only event-driven mandatory disclosures are significant in models that explain voluntary disclosure. We also find that the cost of capital is generally influenced by each of these disclosure types. We also find that controlling for periodic mandatory disclosure does not affect the relationship between voluntary disclosure and the cost of capital, while controlling for event-driven mandatory disclosure sometimes affects the relationship depending on the measures used.

A structured interview was administered separately to parents and children, coded for legacy examples (i.e., those unique to the parent, overlapping, unique to the child), and analyzed with respect to expectations of similarity reported by each participant. Most predicted moderate to high overlap in mutual understanding of parent legacy. This was not the case, as there were far more unique legacy examples given than shared.

Many observers, including prominent political figures, claimed that de-policing caused the homicide rate to rise: Fearing increased legal liability and publicity, the police employed less proactive enforcement and made fewer arrests, producing an increase in homicide levels. We use structural equation modeling to estimate the simultaneous relationship between arrest and homicide rates between 2010 and 2015 in 53 large cities. We find no evidence of an effect of arrest rates on city homicide rates for any offense category for any year in this period, including 2015, the year of the spike in homicide levels. Policy Implications: The results of our analysis reveal that declining rates of arrest did not produce the rise in homicide levels. But arrests, the chief formal reaction to crime, can play an important supporting role in crime prevention. Ample research findings have demonstrated the effectiveness of proactive policing practices, such as targeted patrol, in reducing crime rates. The success of such tactics depends, in turn, on citizens’ belief that criminal offenders face an appreciable risk of arrest. It is equally important, however, that residents of communities that have experienced unwarranted police violence believe that law enforcement is fairly applied. Lack of trust and confidence in the police militates against crime prevention as a co-production of police and community and may promote violence as a form of self-help.",,10.1111/1745-9133.12414,17459133,51,,,85063364977 (Scopus),15386473,1,75,2019-02-01,,https://doi.org/10.1111/1745-9133.12414,Criminology and Public Policy,18

However, few studies have empirically examined trauma using well-characterized developmental samples that are followed longitudinally. Method: The association of assaultive, non-assaultive, and sexual assaultive experiences before 10 years of age with developmental trajectories of brain function during response inhibition was examined by measuring electrophysiologic theta and delta oscillations during no-go and go conditions in an equal probability go/no-go task. Data were drawn from the Collaborative Study of the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA) prospective cohort, composed of offspring who were aged 12 through 22 years at enrollment from high-risk and comparison families, with follow-ups at 2-year intervals since 2004. In addition, other important predictors of neurophysiologic functioning (eg, substance use, impulsivity, and parental alcohol use disorders) were investigated. Moreover, associations of neurophysiologic functioning with alcohol and cannabis use disorder symptom counts and externalizing and internalizing psychopathology were examined. Results: Individuals exposed to sexual assaultive trauma before 10 years of age had slower rates of change in developmental trajectories of no-go frontal theta during response inhibition. Importantly, effects remained significant after accounting for exposure to other traumatic exposures, such as parental history of alcohol use disorder and participants’ substance use, but not measures of impulsivity. Further, slower rates of change in no-go frontal theta adolescent and young adult development were associated with increased risk for alcohol use disorder symptoms and internalizing psychopathology, but not for cannabis use disorder symptoms or externalizing psychopathology. Conclusion: Childhood sexual assault is associated with atypical frontal neurophysiologic development during response inhibition. This could reflect alterations in frontal lobe development, synaptic pruning, and/or cortical maturation involving neural circuits for inhibitory control. These same areas could be associated with increased risk for young adult alcohol use disorder symptoms and internalizing psychopathology. These findings support the hypothesis that changes in neurocognitive development related to early sexual trauma exposure could increase the risk for mental health and substance use problems in young adulthood.",,10.1016/j.jaac.2018.07.905,15275418,242,National Institutes of Health,L30DA042455,85061065872 (Scopus),08908567,2,255.e2,2019-02-01,30738551.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2018.07.905,Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,58

For females, a significant path was found between childhood behavioral problems and only adolescent delinquency. We observed continuity between substance use and between arrest constructs from adolescence through midlife for men only. Direct paths were found between substance use and later arrests for both males and females. Paths were also observed between arrests and later substance use for both genders.

As is common among the smaller 6-8-ring hairpin polyamides (PAs), it binds its target recognition sequence with low nM affinity. However, in addition to its large size, it is distinct from these more extensively characterized PAs in its high tolerance for mismatches and antiviral properties. In ongoing attempts to understand the basis for these distinctions, we conducted thermodynamics studies of PA1-DNA interactions. The temperature dependence of binding affinity was measured using TAMRA-labeled hairpin DNAs containing a single target sequence. PA1 binding to either an ATAT/TATA or an AAAA/TTTT pattern is consistently entropically driven. This is in contrast to the A/T pattern-dependent driving forces for DNA binding by netropsin, distamycin, and smaller hairpin polyamides. Analysis of the salt dependence of PA1-DNA binding reveals that within experimental error, there is no dependence on ionic strength, indicating that the polyelectrolyte effect does not contribute to PA1-DNA binding energetics. This is similar to that observed for smaller PAs. PA1-DNA recognition sequence binding stoichiometries were determined at both nM (fluorescence) and μM (circular dichroism) concentrations. With all sequences and under both conditions, multiple PA1 molecules bind the small DNA hairpin that contains only a single recognition sequence.

My findings reveal that violent pathways are shaped by the confluence of social–psychological mechanisms (e.g., the normalization of violence) and exogenous risk factors (e.g., family disruption and loss of male role models). Compared with nonviolent men, who emphasize themes of catharsis and resilience, and the emulation of prosocial models of masculinity, violent men's narratives are distinguished by themes of persecution and exile, the emulation of violent role models, and contextual barriers to attaining valued masculine identities. Beyond the experience of war, these findings have implications for understanding how early experiences of chronic violence and community disruption shape turning points and cultural frames over the life course, and they indicate that studies of violent pathways should grant greater primacy to the social–historical context and the meaning individuals ascribe to their experiences.",,10.1111/1745-9125.12196,17459125,74,,,85057226042 (Scopus),00111384,1,104,2019-02-01,,https://doi.org/10.1111/1745-9125.12196,Criminology,57

Two independent knockout mutants, plc4-1 and plc4-2, exhibited decreased seedling growth and survival rate whereas overexpression of OsPLC4 improved survival rate under high salinity and water deficiency, compared with wild type (WT).

Applications of DAG or PA restored the growth defect of plc4-1 to WT but DAG kinase inhibitor 1 blocked the complementary effect of DAG in plc4-1 under salt stress.

I test whether differences in self-reported offending (SRO) and willingness to offend (WTO) are consistent with predictions derived from IRT models. Results: Approval of delinquency is a joint function of individual and situational characteristics. Some situations are so “easy” to rationalize that most everyone is predicted to approve of delinquency, and others are so “difficult” that only those very high in θ are predicted to express approval.

Documenting the frequency with which parasites and pathogens disperse across geographic regions contributes to understanding not only their evolution, but also the likelihood that they may become emerging infectious diseases. Haemosporidian parasites of birds (parasite genera Plasmodium, Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon) are globally distributed, dipteran-vectored parasites. To date, over 2000 avian haemosporidian lineages have been designated by molecular barcoding methods. To achieve their current distributions, some lineages must have dispersed long distances, often over water. Here we quantify such events using the global avian haemosporidian database MalAvi and additional records primarily from the Americas. We scored lineages as belonging to one or more global biogeographic regions based on infection records. Most lineages were restricted to a single region but some were globally distributed. We also used part of the cytochrome b gene to create genus-level parasite phylogenies and scored well-supported nodes as having descendant lineages in regional sympatry or allopatry. Descendant sister lineages of Plasmodium, Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon were distributed in allopatry in 11, 16 and 15% of investigated nodes, respectively.

This analysis suggests that emotional and esteem social support messages are associated with improved patient health as measured by a decrease in average blood glucose levels among diabetic patients. In addition, when two system feature variables, two system use variables, two measures of learning, one measure of self-efficacy, and one measure of affect toward their HCP were added to the baseline model, a third significant factor emerged. Perceptions about learning about diabetes from reading the digital messages sent by their HCP also predicted improved patient health.

Identification and characterization of specific sequences and motifs that are critical for virus infection and pathogenicity could provide useful insights and targets for engineering virus resistance that is potentially both broad spectrum and durable. Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), the most prolific member of the group, was used to better understand the structure-function relationships of the nucleocapsid gene (N), and the silencing suppressor gene (NSs), coded by the TSWV small RNA. Methods: Using a global collection of orthotospoviral sequences, several amino acids that were conserved across the genus and the potential location of these conserved amino acid motifs in these proteins was determined. We used state of the art 3D modeling algorithms, MULTICOM-CLUSTER, MULTICOM-CONSTRUCT, MULTICOM-NOVEL, I-TASSER, ROSETTA and CONFOLD to predict the secondary and tertiary structures of the N and the NSs proteins. Results: We identified nine amino acid residues in the N protein among 31 known tospoviral species, and ten amino acid residues in NSs protein among 27 tospoviral species that were conserved across the genus. For the N protein, all three algorithms gave nearly identical tertiary models. While the conserved residues were distributed throughout the protein on a linear scale, at the tertiary level, three residues were consistently located in the coil in all the models. For NSs protein models, there was no agreement among the three algorithms. However, with respect to the localization of the conserved motifs, G 18 was consistently located in coil, while H 115 was localized in the coil in three models. Conclusions: This is the first report of predicting the 3D structure of any tospoviral NSs protein and revealed a consistent location for two of the ten conserved residues. The modelers used gave accurate prediction for N protein allowing the localization of the conserved residues. Results form the basis for further work on the structure-function relationships of tospoviral proteins and could be useful in developing novel virus control strategies targeting the conserved residues.",7,10.1186/s12985-018-1106-4,1743422X,,,,85059846934 (Scopus),,1,,2019-01-11,30634979.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-018-1106-4,Virology Journal,16

However, high temperature and humidity adversely impacts soybean seed development, yield, and quality during plant development and after harvest. Genetic improvement of soybean tolerance to stress environments is highly desirable. Results: Transgenic soybean lines with knockdown of phospholipase Dα1 (PLDα1KD) were generated to study PLDα1′s effects on lipid metabolism and seed vigor under high temperature and humidity conditions. Under such stress, as compared with normal growth conditions, PLDα1KD lines showed an attenuated stress-induced deterioration during soybean seed development, which was associated with elevated expression of reactive oxygen species-scavenging genes when compared with wild-type control. The developing seeds of PLDα1KD had higher levels of unsaturation in triacylglycerol (TAG) and major membrane phospholipids, but lower levels of phosphatidic acid and lysophospholipids compared with control cultivar. Lipid metabolite and gene expression profiling indicates that the increased unsaturation on phosphatidylcholine (PC) and enhanced conversion between PC and diacylglycerol (DAG) by PC:DAG acyltransferase underlie a basis for increased TAG unsaturation in PLDα1KD seeds. Meanwhile, the turnover of PC and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) into lysoPC and lysoPE was suppressed in PLDα1KD seeds under high temperature and humidity conditions. PLDα1KD developing seeds suffered lighter oxidative stresses than did wild-type developing seeds in the stressful environments. PLDα1KD seeds contain higher oil contents and maintained higher germination rates than the wild-type seeds. Conclusions: The study provides insights into the roles of PLDα1 in developing soybean seeds under high temperature and humidity stress. PLDα1KD decreases pre-harvest deterioration and enhances acyl editing in phospholipids and TAGs.

PKGs from plants are structurally unique with an additional type 2C protein phosphatase domain. Rice PKG possesses both protein kinase and phosphatase activities, and cGMP stimulates its kinase activity but inhibits its phosphatase activity. One of PKG's targets is GAMYB, a transcription factor in GA signaling, and the dual activities of PKG catalyze the reversible phosphorylation of GAMYB at Ser6 and modulate the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of GAMYB in response to GA. Loss of PKG impeded the nuclear localization of GAMYB and abolished GAMYB function in the GA response, leading to defects in GA-induced seed germination, internode elongation, and pollen viability.

The proposed design is based on the deflection of high-energy charged cosmic particles (protons, alpha particles, electrons, etc.) by the electrostatic field created by multiplate low-energy capacitors surrounding the habitat capsule of a spacecraft. In this design, the electrical field outside the capacitors is negligibly small, which prevents the attraction of charged particles from the outer space to the spacecraft and does not affect the astronauts inside. Because the proposed shielding was designed to deflect any sort of charged particles and not to stop them, the design does not require thick and heavy materials to protect the spacecraft. In addition to active shielding by the electrostatic field of light capacitors, it is also proposed that the habitat capsule be surrounded by passive shielding “sandwichlike” multilayers of novel ultralight materials filled with hydrogen. Because of this, the proposed design is relatively lightweight, made of low-cost materials, simple to build and assemble, easily scalable to smaller or larger sizes or energy, and repeatable for double or multiple layers. In addition, a technique of using the cosmic charged particles to charge the capacitors as an additional supply of energy for the shielding system function and spacecraft operation is proposed.",,10.2514/1.A34440,15336794,1312,U.S. Department of State,,85073119150 (Scopus),00224650,5,1321,2019-01-01,,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.A34440,Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets,56

Using observations obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope, NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility, the 3.5 m Astrophysical Research Consortium telescope at Apache Point Observatory, the Discovery Channel Telescope at Lowell Observatory, and the Arizona Radio Observatory 10 m Submillimeter Telescope, we quantified the abundances of 12 different species in the coma of R2 PanSTARRS: CO, CO2, H2O, CH4, C2H6, HCN, CH3OH, H2CO, OCS, C2H2, NH3, and N2. We confirm the high abundances of CO and N2 and heavy depletions of H2O, HCN, CH3OH, and H2CO compared to CO reported by previous studies. We provide the first measurements (or most sensitive measurements/constraints) on H2O, CO2, CH4, C2H6, OCS, C2H2, and NH3, all of which are depleted relative to CO by at least 1-2 orders of magnitude compared to values commonly observed in comets. The observed species also show strong enhancements relative to H2O, and, even when compared to other species like CH4 or CH3OH, most species show deviations from typical comets by at least a factor of 2-3. The only mixing ratios found to be close to typical are CH3OH/CO2 and CH3OH/CH4. The CO2/CO ratio is within a factor of 2 of those observed for C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp) and C/2006 W3 (Christensen) at a similar heliocentric distance, though it is at least an order of magnitude lower than many other comets observed with AKARI. While R2 PanSTARRS was located at a heliocentric distance of 2.8 au at the time of our observations in 2018 January/February, we argue, using sublimation models and comparison to other comets observed at similar heliocentric distance, that this alone cannot account for the peculiar observed composition of this comet and therefore must reflect its intrinsic composition. We discuss possible implications for this clear outlier in compositional studies of comets obtained to date and encourage future dynamical and chemical modeling in order to better understand what the composition of R2 PanSTARRS tells us about the early solar system.",128,10.3847/1538-3881/ab32e4,,,Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences,1005313,85072700178 (Scopus),00046256,3,,2019-01-01,,https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-3881/ab32e4,Astronomical Journal,158

Police have faced high levels of public scrutiny that some argue has stifled police activities and led to spikes in violent crime. This phenomenon-coined in the aftermath of the police killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri-has become widely known as the Ferguson Effect. This study uses seven years of data and time series analysis to assess whether the events in Ferguson were associated with a reduction in arrests for felonies and low-level offenses in the nearby City of St. Louis, Missouri. We find that there was an initial reduction in low-level arrests of Whites and Blacks in the wake of Ferguson. Enforcement of misdemeanors and ordinance violations then increased and returned to expected levels, but only for Blacks. Post-Ferguson, felony arrests initially dropped for Blacks, but not Whites, and then climbed for both groups.

The radial velocity distribution for 32 objects, most with Class I or flat-spectrum spectral energy distributions, is marginally Gaussian, with a higher dispersion relative to optical surveys at the 2σ level. When comparing the results from both proper-motion and radial velocity surveys in L1688, there is a trend for the 1D dispersions to be higher for samples of Class I/flat-spectrum YSOs that reside in the cloud core compared to Class II/III dominated samples, which are located in the lower extinction periphery. In addition, there is a velocity gradient along the major axis of the cloud core that appears more pronounced than that derived from optically visible objects at the cloud edges. If these higher dispersions for Class I/flat-spectrum objects are confirmed by future surveys, this could imply a supervirial state for the less evolved objects in the cloud core and be a signature of the initial collapse and rebound of the cluster as suggested by recent simulations of cluster evolution.",41,10.3847/1538-3881/ab24c0,,,National Aeronautics and Space Administration,NNH14CK55B,85072386305 (Scopus),00046256,1,,2019-01-01,,https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-3881/ab24c0,Astronomical Journal,158

Design: Prospective investigation of children with PHIV compared with demographically similar perinatally HIV-exposed but uninfected (PHEU) and HIV-unexposed, uninfected (HUU) children, all from Thailand and Cambodia. Methods: The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL; parent version) was administered at baseline and annual follow-up visits (median follow-up of 3 years) to children age 6 14. Resilience was defined as consistent CBCL scores on the Internalizing, Externalizing or Total Problem T scales within normative ranges (T-scores <60) at every time point.

Breaking of lattice potential well-induced confinement of carriers in conjugated polymers,OA,-,-,Bronze OA,-,-,https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.27.023476,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85070264537,,"Recent experimental research has reported that a surface electric field on the polymer solar cell can restrain the recombination of the resultant charged carriers [23]. Based on this, this article reveals an underlying mechanism: If a surface electric field below 4.5 × 104 V/cm is applied to the polymer layer, the electric field drives the charged polaron to transport. Once the polaron approaches and collides with the exciton, it is easily trapped by the potential well produced by the exciton and then forms a charged exciton. The decay of the resultant charged exciton rapidly reduces the number of excitons. However, once the external field surpasses the threshold value of 4.5 × 104 V/cm, the charged polaron absorbs momentum from the external electric field and shakes off the trapping of the exciton. It finally steps out of the original lattice potential well, where the appropriate electric field magnitude ranges from 5.5 × 104 V/cm to 8 × 105 V/cm. After a collision of 300 fs, apart from a phase shift, the exciton still exists. Then, the originally carriers is dissociated when the electric field reaches 0.8 MV/cm. The applied surface field is able to effectively keep the excitons from fusion with the transporting charged polarons, which provides a valid and easily manufactured approach to yield higher efficiency of polymer solar cells.",,10.1364/OE.27.023476,10944087,26476,National Natural Science Foundation of China,21374105,85070264537 (Scopus),,16,26485,2019-01-01,31510624.0,https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.27.023476,Optics Express,27

Six weeks post-hospitalization, ten outpatients with the diagnosis of bipolar disorder underwent an in-depth interview. Findings: Four diagnostic processes were identified during the retrospective record review. Two patterns and five themes were identified from the interviews. The first pattern, living with undiagnosed bipolar disorder, demonstrated common experiences of distinguishing impulsive moods and behavior, suffering life challenges, and seeking relief. The second pattern, acclimating to a new diagnosis of bipolar disorder, demonstrated participants’ ways of understanding the diagnosis and reconciling the diagnosis. Patterns in the interviews corroborated data from the record review. Conclusions: The rendering of an appropriate diagnosis is key.

The multiple features of mobile phones offer great opportunities to disseminate large-scale, cost-efficient, and tailored messages to participants. However, the interventions to date have shown mixed results, with a large variance of effect sizes (Cohen d=−0.62 to 1.65). Objective: The study aimed to generate cumulative knowledge that informs mHealth intervention research. The aims were twofold: (1) to calculate an overall effect magnitude for mHealth interventions compared with alternative interventions or conditions, and (2) to analyze potential moderators of mHealth interventions’ comparative efficacy. Methods: Comprehensive searches of the Communication & Mass Media Complete, PsycINFO, Web of Knowledge, Academic Search Premier, PubMed and MEDLINE databases were conducted to identify potentially eligible studies in peer-reviewed journals, conference proceedings, and dissertations and theses.

Cohen d was computed as the basic unit of analysis, and the variance-weighted analysis was implemented to compute the overall effect size under a random-effects model. Analysis of variance–like and meta-regression models were conducted to analyze categorical and continuous moderators, respectively. Results: The search resulted in 3424 potential studies, the abstracts (and full text, as necessary) of which were reviewed for relevance.

A total of 64 studies were included in the current meta-analysis. Results showed that mHealth interventions are relatively more effective than comparison interventions or conditions, with a small but significant overall weighted effect size (Cohen d=0.31). In addition, the effects of interventions are moderated by theoretical paradigm, 3 engagement types (ie, changing personal environment, reinforcement tracking, social presentation), mobile use type, intervention channel, and length of follow-up. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive meta-analysis to date that examined the overall effectiveness of mHealth interventions across health topics and is the first study that statistically tested moderators. Our findings not only shed light on intervention design using mobile phones, but also provide new directions for research in health communication and promotion using new media. Future research scholarship is needed to examine the effectiveness of mHealth interventions across various health issues, especially those that have not yet been investigated (eg, substance use, sexual health), engaging participants using social features on mobile phones, and designing tailored mHealth interventions for diverse subpopulations to maximize effects.",e11244,10.2196/11244,22915222,,,,85066481585 (Scopus),,4,,2019-01-01,,https://doi.org/10.2196/11244,JMIR mHealth and uHealth,7

Effort and fatigue-related functional connectivity in mild traumatic brain injury,OA,Gold OA,-,-,Green Final OA,-,https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2018.01165,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85065449755,"Effort, Fatigue, FMRI, Functional connectivity, Mild traumatic brain injury","Mental fatigue in healthy individuals is typically observed under conditions of high cognitive demand, particularly when effort is required to perform a task for a long period of time-thus the concepts of fatigue and effort are closely related. In brain injured individuals, mental fatigue can be a persistent and debilitating symptom. Presence of fatigue after brain injury is prognostic for return to work/school and engagement in activities of daily life. As such, it should be a high priority for treatment in this population, but because there is little understanding of its behavioral and neural underpinnings, the target for such treatment is unknown. Here, the neural underpinnings of fatigue and effort are investigated in active duty military service members with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and demographically-matched orthopedic controls. Participants performed a Constant Effort task for which they were to hold a pre-defined effort level constant for long durations during FMRI scanning. The task allowed for investigation of the neural systems underlying fatigue and their relationship with sense of effort. While brain activation associated with effort and fatigue did not differentiate the mTBI and controls, functional connectivity amongst active brain regions did. The mTBI group demonstrated immediate hyper-connectivity that increased with effort level but diminished quickly when there was a need to maintain effort. Controls, in contrast, demonstrated a similar pattern of hyper-connectivity, but only when maintaining effort over time. Connectivity, particularly between the left anterior insula, rostral anterior cingulate cortex, and right-sided inferior frontal regions, correlated with effort-level and state fatigue in mTBI participants. These connections also correlated with effort level in the Control group, but only the connection between the left insula and superior medial frontal gyrus correlated with fatigue, suggesting a differing pattern of connectivity. These findings align, in part, with the dopamine imbalance, and neural efficiency hypotheses that pose key roles for medial frontal connections with insular or striatal regions in motivating or optimizing performance. Sense of effort and fatigue are closely related. As people fatigue, sense of effort increases systematically. The data propose a complex link between sense of effort, fatigue, and mTBI that is centered in what may be an inefficient neural system due to brain trauma that warrants further investigation.",1165,10.3389/fneur.2018.01165,16642295,,,,85065449755 (Scopus),,JAN,,2019-01-01,,https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2018.01165,Frontiers in Neurology,10

Due to poor availability of modern healthcare facilities and poverty of indigenous people, they depend on local medicinal plants for the healthcare of their domestic animals. This study is the first attempt to document the indigenous knowledge and evaluate the conservation status of medicinal plants and practices of herbal remedies by the local people of Chamla Valley in the treatment of their livestock. Semi-structured questionnaire was used and 120 local inhabitants were interviewed to note the traditional practices regarding plant species uses. Well-known statistical indices, Use Value formula and Relative Frequency Citations were used for quantification of the recorded data. It was observed that 50 medicinal plants belonging to 38 families were reported, where Poaceae was the most cited. The common livestock are goats, sheep, buffalos, cows, bulls and donkeys. Most of the herbs, which are used in livestock treatment, are wild and few plants are cultivated. The common livestock diseases are red water, three days sickness, diarrhea, tympany and indigestion among others. Most of the plants are used in fresh condition.

In order to deal with these problems, this paper proposes a novel incentive mechanism based on a new auction model for mobile crowd sensing, which consists of two consecutive stages. In the first stage, a novel Incentive Method based on Reverse Auction for Location-aware sensing (IMRAL) is proposed to maximize user utility. By introducing a task-centric method to determine the winning bids, it can provide higher user utility and higher task coverage ratio. To ensure the truthfulness of IMRAL, we design a unique payment determination algorithm based on critical payment for the incentive platform. In the second stage, we propose a user-interaction incentive model (UIBIM) to cover the situation that a user may drop out of the sensing activity. This new incentive model includes a dynamic double auction framework prompting users' interaction and a user matching algorithm based on a bipartite graph. The proposed new mechanism achieves the goal of improving task completion rates without increasing the cost of the incentive platform. The simulation results show that comparing with other solutions, such as a truthful auction for location-aware collaborative sensing in mobile crowdsourcing and incentive mechanism for crowdsourcing in the single-requester single-bid-model, IMRAL can achieve better performance in terms of average user utility and tasks coverage ratio, and the UIBIM can significantly improve task completion rates.",8664672,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2902882,21693536,43933,National Natural Science Foundation of China,cstc 2015jcyiBX0009,85064538024 (Scopus),,,43947,2019-01-01,,https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2902882,IEEE Access,7

The supplier will over-invest but under-build the specific capacity under quantity commitment only contracts, and will under-invest but over-build the specific capacity under price-only initial contracts. There exists an initial quantity plus price contract or option contract that induces the supplier to build the capacity and invest in cost reduction at the first-best level with or without ex post renegotiation.

These processes might be connected if conditions that favor the proliferation of species, such as release from competitors, facilitate the evolution of novel ecological relationships. Despite this, phylogenetic studies do not consistently identify such a connection. Conversely, if higher diversity caused species to become increasingly specialized ecologically, then lineage diversification might become dissociated from ecological diversification. In this analysis, we ask whether the rate of lineage diversification in a large clade of birds is correlated with morphological specialization and with rates of morphological evolution. We find that morphological variation is related to species richness within clades but that rates of morphological evolution are decoupled from the rate of lineage diversification. Additionally, morphological specialization within lineages is independent of the rate at which lineages diversify, with the results apparently robust against false negative inference. This dissociation is likely a consequence of the major ecomorphological differences between avian clades arising early in their evolutionary history, with comparatively little variation added subsequently, while avian diversification has been driven predominantly by geographic isolation and sexual selection. Accordingly, biodiversity appears to be limited by the extent to which taxa can subdivide exploited regions of ecological space and not just overall ecological opportunity.",,10.1086/701630,,,,,85061646716 (Scopus),00030147,,,2019-01-01,30912971.0,https://doi.org/10.1086/701630,American Naturalist,

New antimicrobials must both exhibit potency and thwart the ability of bacteria to develop resistance to them. We report the use of synthetic ionophores as a new approach to developing non-resistant antimicrobials and adjuvants. Most studies involving amphiphilic antimicrobials have focused on either developing synthetic amphiphiles that show ion transport, or developing non-cytotoxic analogs of such peptidic amphiphiles as colistin. We have rationally designed, prepared, and evaluated crown ether-based synthetic ionophores (‘hydraphiles') that show selective ion transport through bilayer membranes and are toxic to bacteria. We report here that hydraphiles exhibit a broad range of antimicrobial properties and that they function as adjuvants in concert with FDA-approved antibiotics against multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria. Studies described herein demonstrate that benzyl C 14 hydraphile (BC 14 H) shows high efficacy as an antimicrobial. BC 14 H, at sub-MIC concentrations, forms aggregates of ∼200 nm that interact with the surface of bacteria. Surface-active BC 14 H then localizes in the bacterial membranes, which increases their permeability. As a result, antibiotic influx into the bacterial cytosol increases in the presence of BC n Hs. Efflux pump inhibition and accumulation of substrate was also observed, likely due to disruption of the cation gradient. As a result, BC 14 H recovers the activity of norfloxacin by 128-fold against resistant Staphylococcus aureus. BC 14 H shows extremely low resistance development and is less cytotoxic than colistin.

We investigated (i) whether being religious/spiritual is an independent predictor of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in a large international sample of adults with congenital heart disease, (ii) whether the individual level of importance of religion/spirituality is an independent predictor for PROs, and (iii) if these relationships are moderated by the degree to which the respective countries are religious or secular. Methods and results: APPROACH-IS was a cross-sectional study, in which 4028 patients from 15 countries were enrolled. Patients completed questionnaires to measure perceived health status; psychological functioning; health behaviors; and quality of life. Religion/spirituality was measured using three questions: Do you consider yourself religious or spiritual?; How important is religion, spirituality, or faith in your life?; and If religious, to what religion do you belong?. The country level of religiosity/secularity was appraised using data from the Gallup Poll 2005–2009. General linear mixed models, adjusting for patient characteristics and country differences were applied. Overall, 49.2% of patients considered themselves to be religious/spiritual. Being religious/spiritual and considering religion/spirituality as important in one's life was positively associated with quality of life, satisfaction with life and health behaviors. However, among patients living in more secular countries, religion/spirituality was negatively associated with physical and mental health. Conclusion: Religiosity/spirituality is an independent predictor for some PROs, but has differential impact across countries.",,10.1016/j.ijcard.2018.07.103,18741754,93,Cardiac Children's Foundation Taiwan,CCF2013_02,85050803055 (Scopus),01675273,,99,2019-01-01,30077534.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2018.07.103,International Journal of Cardiology,274

Methods: Participants were 120 women providing healthcare and medication assistance to an earlier generation family member with physical and/or cognitive impairments. Results: Hierarchical regression confirmed that intergenerational ambivalence explained perceived stress in family care partners, beyond the variance accounted for by other commonly reported stressors such as length of caregiving experience, memory/cognitive and functional impairments of the care recipient, caregiver overload, family conflict and financial strain. Further analyses revealed that examining dyadic strain apart from intergenerational ambivalence may more accurately explain the influence of ambivalence scores on care partners’ perceived stress.

LipG a bifunctional phospholipase/thioesterase involved in mycobacterial envelope remodeling,OA,Gold OA,-,-,Green Final OA,-,https://doi.org/10.1042/BSR20181953,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85058901189,,"Tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis is currently one of the leading causes of death from an infectious agent. The main difficulties encountered in eradicating this bacteria are mainly related to (i) a very complex lipid composition of the bacillus cell wall, (ii) its ability to hide from the immune system inside the granulomas, and (iii) the increasing number of resistant strains. In this context, we were interested in the Rv0646c (lipG MTB ) gene located upstream to the mmaA cluster which is described as being crucial for the production of cell wall components and required for the bacilli adaptation and survival in mouse macrophages. Using biochemical experiments combined with the construction of deletion and overexpression mutant strains in Mycobacterium smegmatis, we found that LipG MTB is a cytoplasmic membrane-associated enzyme that displays both phospholipase and thioesterase activities. Overproduction of LipG MTB decreases the glycopeptidolipids (GPL) level concomitantly to an increase in phosphatidylinositol (PI) which is the precursor of the PI mannoside (PIM), an essential lipid component of the bacterial cell wall. Conversely, deletion of the lipG MS gene in M. smegmatis leads to an overproduction of GPL, and subsequently decreases the strain susceptibility to various antibiotics. All these findings demonstrate that LipG is involved in cell envelope biosynthesis/remodeling, and consequently this enzyme may thus play an important role in mycobacterial physiology.",BSR20181953,10.1042/BSR20181953,15734935,,Aix-Marseille Université,,85058901189 (Scopus),01448463,6,,2018-12-18,30487163.0,https://doi.org/10.1042/BSR20181953,Bioscience Reports,38

In this context, analogs of the naturally occurring enolphosphates Cyclipostins and Cyclophostin (CyC analogs) offer new therapeutic opportunities. The CyC analogs display potent activity both in vitro and in infected macrophages against several pathogenic mycobacteria including Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium abscessus. Interestingly, these CyC inhibitors target several enzymes with active-site serine or cysteine residues that play key roles in mycobacterial lipid and cell wall metabolism. Among them, TesA, a putative thioesterase involved in the synthesis of phthiocerol dimycocerosates (PDIMs) and phenolic glycolipids (PGLs), has been identified. These two lipids (PDIM and PGL) are non-covalently bound to the outer cell wall in several human pathogenic mycobacteria and are important virulence factors. Herein, we used biochemical and structural approaches to validate TesA as an effective pharmacological target of the CyC analogs. We confirmed both thioesterase and esterase activities of TesA, and showed that the most active inhibitor CyC17 binds covalently to the catalytic Ser104 residue leading to a total loss of enzyme activity. These data were supported by the X-ray structure, obtained at a 2.6-Å resolution, of a complex in which CyC17 is bound to TesA. Our study provides evidence that CyC17 inhibits the activity of TesA, thus paving the way to a new strategy for impairing the PDIM and PGL biosynthesis, potentially decreasing the virulence of associated mycobacterial species.",,10.1016/j.jmb.2018.09.017,10898638,5120,Aix-Marseille Université,792803C,85054770410 (Scopus),00222836,24,5136,2018-12-07,30292819.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2018.09.017,Journal of Molecular Biology,430

This study advances understanding of the relationship between offending and age for the second half of the age-crime curve (i.e., during the decline in offending) by studying when desistance happens in young adulthood and beyond. Methods: Synthesizing data from 15 US-based longitudinal studies, this research triangulates the timing of official desistance by systematically mapping the age of last criminal justice contact (e.g., arrest, police contact) by age of last follow-up for offenders who continue offending beyond “normative” adolescent offending. Results: On average, official desistance occurs within a tightly clustered period early in the life course (i.e., late 20s to early 30s). Even among those followed well into adulthood (age 30 or older), the average age of last criminal justice contact was 35 with later ages of desistance driven by arrests for drug offenses. Observed patterns hold when data are disaggregated by sex, race, type of sample, source of data, and accounting for incarceration. Data censoring (i.e., length of follow-up) strongly impacts estimates of desistance. Conclusions: The finding that official desistance largely occurs in early adulthood is inconsistent with US criminal justice policy.

Research in four developing countries finds an increase in youth savings account uptake when financial institutions provide opportunities at schools for youth to receive financial education, open savings accounts, and make deposits. Findings are that school banking can overcome some of the regulatory, geographic, and information barriers that limit youth access to safe and affordable savings services. Marginalized youth, including those who are low-income and females, participate as much as other youth.

Mangrove forest is a coastal ecosystem restricted to the tropics and subtropics. However, the factors that influence fine-scale assemblage composition of mangroves remain an open question. This study aimed to identify range-limiting climate factor(s) associated with species composition that are likely to have influenced the evolution of mangroves. Location: China. Time period: 1950s–2013. Major taxa studied: True mangrove species. Methods: We collected species presence–absence data across 70 sites spread between 18 and 27°N in China to analyse the latitudinal diversity gradient in relationship to 25 climate variables. To examine the change in community composition along the diversity gradient, we analysed two components of beta diversity: turnover-resultant dissimilarity and nestedness-resultant dissimilarity. We used non-metric multidimensional scaling to identify crucial climate factors associated with variation in mangrove assemblage composition. We also applied variance partitioning among taxonomic ranks to detect taxonomic signal in climatic tolerance of mangroves. Results: First, total species richness decreases with increasing latitude. Second, variation in mangrove assemblage composition is significantly correlated with winter temperature, exhibiting a nested subset structure in species composition and a gradual decrease in the number of thermophilic species with increasing latitude. Finally, mangrove species show a genus-level signal in tolerance of winter temperature, whereas most other climate factors vary primarily among species within genera. Main conclusions: Winter temperature appears to constrain the current distributions of mangrove species, and tolerance of low air temperature is evolutionarily conservative at the genus level. These ecological and phylogenetic patterns collectively suggest that physiological constraints related to cold tolerance structure the nested pattern with respect to the latitude of mangrove assemblages at a regional scale.",,10.1111/geb.12826,14668238,1492,National Natural Science Foundation of China,31470513,85054503302 (Scopus),1466822X,12,1506,2018-12-01,,https://doi.org/10.1111/geb.12826,Global Ecology and Biogeography,27

Methods: A concurrent embedded mixed-methods design was used, including a Heideggerian hermeneutic qualitative approach that focuses on the participants’ perceptions as a vehicle for understanding the phenomenon of seeking pain relief with descriptive quantitative data in a supporting role. Thirteen interviews and 15 surveys were analyzed, all of which met the following criteria: (1) self-reported chronic pain (persistent pain lasting a minimum of six months), (2) current use of prescription opioid medications, (3) pain not successfully controlled. Results: The analysis revealed a paradox, which we describe as being lost/finding myself in the health care system. This paradox became the overarching pattern of experience that subsumed several dynamic, overlapping practices described in the patterns: (1) seeking relief as suffering; (2) being classified as an addict but not an addict; (3) living with pain as remembering; and (4) experiencing treatment modalities as fickle possibilities.

DAPSO-SSL maps the basic human nature of awareness, maturity, leader and followers relationship and leadership qualities to the popular PSO algorithm. It assigns these qualities to swarm leader and individual particles. In practical life, it is the moral responsibility of the leader to improve the status, quality or direction of the life of his followers. Thus, he influences the decision making of the group members through his policies and actions. A great leader is one which continuously keeps track of his followers’ performance and accordingly adapts to various situations. If their performance is degrading because of him, he can either change his policies or can groom a new leader to take his position. Hence this leader can be Sensitive to the needs of group members. It also incorporates the concept of iterative directional awareness among the swarm particles in PSO. The particles over successive iterations become more conscious about their direction of motion by taking account of their performances. DAPSO-SSL thus tries to prevent stagnation while improving convergence rate. The algorithm is tested on twenty-four benchmark functions on COCO framework and its performance is compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms. Further, in order to check the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, DAPSO-SSL is applied to community detection problem of big data networks.

We also propose a new pipeline to deal with inconsistencies in NHCs and to limit the area of occupancy of the species. We found a significant but weak positive relationship between the distribution of NHCs and IDW for 66% of the species. The relationship between SDMs and IDW was also significant but weakly positive for 95% of the species, and sensitivity for both analyses was high.

A typical conjugated polymer, poly(p-phenylene vinylene), is chosen as a model for the research. When an external laser beam of 60 μJ/cm2 is applied to photoexcite the polymer, the energy levels begin to oscillate within 100 fs. Thanks to the prominent self-trapping effect of the conjugated polymer, the laser beam also drives the lattice of the polymer chain to strongly vibrate. Until about 200 fs, four energy levels are pulled to the center of the energy gap, resulting in a transient discrete four-energy-level electronic structure for ASE. Simultaneously, in this ultrafast dynamical process, within the first 1 ps, inversion of the electron population occurs along with the appearance of a localized electronic cloud and locally distorted alternating bonds of the polymer chain.

A two-stage process has been proposed for the evolution of mutualisms that involve exchanges of two costly resources. First, costly provisioning by one species may be selected for if that species gains a benefit from costless byproducts generated by a second species, and cooperators get disproportionate access to byproducts. Selection could then drive the second species to provide costly resources in return. Previously, a synthetic consortium evolved the first stage of this scenario: Salmonella enterica evolved costly production of methionine in exchange for costless carbon byproducts generated by an auxotrophic Escherichia coli. Growth on agar plates localized the benefits of cooperation around methionine-secreting S. enterica. Here, we report that further evolution of these partners on plates led to hypercooperative E. coli that secrete the sugar galactose. Sugar secretion arose repeatedly across replicate communities and is costly to E. coli producers, but enhances the growth of S. enterica. The tradeoff between individual costs and group benefits led to maintenance of both cooperative and efficient E. coli genotypes in this spatially structured environment. This study provides an experimental example of de novo, bidirectional costly mutualism evolving from byproduct consumption. The results validate the plausibility of costly cooperation emerging from initially costless exchange, a scenario widely used to explain the origin of the mutualistic species interactions that are central to life on Earth.",,10.1073/pnas.1810949115,10916490,12000,National Institutes of Health,1R01-GM121498,85056763841 (Scopus),00278424,47,12004,2018-11-20,30348787.0,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1810949115,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,115

With ECEP2D, students can gain deeper insights into gel electrophoresis by performing hands-on simulations. For example, students can visualize how 2D gel electrophoresis can improve resolution over 1D by comparing them side-by-side. Students can watch how different enzymes cut a protein into different fragments, giving rise to different gel patterns; some patterns are less congested than the others. Students can recognize how enzyme digestion can enhance gel electrophoresis to distinguish proteins. For students not having the chance to take biochemistry laboratories, ECEP2D provides a useful simulated learning environment. Instructors can also complement wet-lab experiments with simulations by ECEP2D to introduce more concepts with fewer laboratory hours.

We investigated the importance of microhabitat features in the selection of oviposition sites versus tadpole rearing sites, as well as in determining offspring survival, in the golden rocket frog, Anomaloglossus beebei. Endemic to Guyana, this species exhibits biparental care and exclusively uses phytotelmata in bromeliads for oviposition and tadpole rearing. We used model-based inference to evaluate evidence that parents prioritize different microhabitat features in selecting phytotelmata suitable for oviposition versus tadpole rearing and that microhabitat selection can adaptively promote offspring survival. For phytotelmata in 132 bromeliads, we quantified bromeliad size, phytotelm height, leaf angle (indicative of location within the bromeliad), water volume, water temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, and the presence/absence of potential predators and nearby conspecifics. Compared to tadpole rearing sites, oviposition sites were found in phytotelmata associated with leaves at lower angles within bromeliads, smaller water volumes, lower water temperatures, higher dissolved oxygen concentrations, and more predatory crabs. Compared with unsuccessful egg clutches, successful clutches were found in phytotelmata with lower water temperatures, higher dissolved oxygen concentrations, fewer crabs, more dragonfly larvae, and more nearby conspecifics. We conclude that the nonrandom patterns of microhabitat use for oviposition sites and tadpole rearing sites in golden rocket frogs are associated with specific environmental factors that promote offspring survival through a critical stage of the animals’ complex life cycle.",,10.1111/btp.12609,17447429,919,Explorers Club,,85058046491 (Scopus),00063606,6,928,2018-11-01,,https://doi.org/10.1111/btp.12609,Biotropica,50

While the general social services field values services based in science, many therapists’ practices are not grounded in and directed by empirical evidence. This study was a secondary analysis of data collected from 17 (N = 17) social service organizations. The final sample consisted of 440 frontline therapists. Findings: We find that about one-third (32.7%) of therapists are reluctant to use a new intervention if required by their state, agency, or supervisor. These reluctant empirically supported treatment users had higher levels of field experience (aOR = 1.02, 95% CI = 1.00, 1.05, p =.002) and more years at their present job (aOR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.01, 1.09, p =.001). We also find an association between race (white versus nonwhite) and the likelihood of being reluctant to using empirically supported treatments, with nonwhites being more likely to be reluctant to use empirically supported treatments (aOR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.00, 2.95, p =.001). Applications: Outcomes indicate that there is a cohort of frontline clinical therapists who are reluctant to use new, empirically supported interventions even if mandated to do so. Organizational leaders may need to consider barriers such as therapist demographics (e.g. years in the field or at the agency), client demographics (e.g. race/ethnicity concordance), and the perceived level of cultural appropriateness of empirically supported treatments by therapists when determining strategies to achieve increased use of empirically supported treatments.",,10.1177/1468017317743138,1741296X,666,,,85055919350 (Scopus),14680173,6,678,2018-11-01,,https://doi.org/10.1177/1468017317743138,Journal of Social Work,18

However, despite rapid development of metrics to characterize the forest canopy from remotely sensed data, a gap remains between aerial and field inventories. To close this gap, we propose a new pan-tropical model to predict plot-level forest structure properties and biomass from only the largest trees. Location: Pan-tropical. Time period: Early 21st century. Major taxa studied: Woody plants. Methods: Using a dataset of 867 plots distributed among 118 sites across the tropics, we tested the prediction of the quadratic mean diameter, basal area, Lorey's height, community wood density and aboveground biomass (AGB) from the ith largest trees. Results: Measuring the largest trees in tropical forests enables unbiased predictions of plot- and site-level forest structure. The 20 largest trees per hectare predicted quadratic mean diameter, basal area, Lorey's height, community wood density and AGB with 12, 16, 4, 4 and 17.7% of relative error, respectively. Most of the remaining error in biomass prediction is driven by differences in the proportion of total biomass held in medium-sized trees (50–70 cm diameter at breast height), which shows some continental dependency, with American tropical forests presenting the highest proportion of total biomass in these intermediate-diameter classes relative to other continents. Main conclusions: Our approach provides new information on tropical forest structure and can be used to generate accurate field estimates of tropical forest carbon stocks to support the calibration and validation of current and forthcoming space missions.

This paper focuses on anti-realism about normativity to investigate this alleged advantage to anti-realism in detail. I set up a framework in which a version of anti-realism explains a type of modal reliability that appears to be epistemologically promising, and plausibly explains the appearance of an epistemological advantage to realism. But, I argue, this appearance is illusory, and on closer investigation the anti-realist view does not succeed in explaining the presence of familiar epistemological properties for normative belief like knowledge or the absence of defeat. My conclusion on the basis of this framework is that there is a tension in the anti-realist view between the urge to idealize the conditions in which normative beliefs ground normative facts, and a robust kind of reliability that normative belief can have if the anti-realist resists these idealizations.",,10.1007/s11098-017-0981-7,15730883,2763,Saint Louis University,,85029181144 (Scopus),00318116,11,2789,2018-11-01,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11098-017-0981-7,Philosophical Studies,175
Laser-induced ultrafast transport and demagnetization at the earliest time: First-principles and real-time investigation,OA,-,-,-,Green Final OA,Green Accepted OA,https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-648X/aae5a9,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85055652689,"crystal momentum, interband transitions, intraband transitions, laser-induced, transport, ultrafast demagnetization","It is generally believed that there are at least two ways to use an ultrafast laser pulse to demagnetize a magnetic sample. One is to directly photo-demagnetize the system through spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and the other is to utilize ultrafast hot electron transport without SOC. The challenge is that these two processes are entangled on the same time scale. While the experimental results have been inconclusive, theoretical investigations are even scarcer, beyond those earlier studies based on spin superdiffusion. For instance, we do not even know how fast electrons move under laser excitation and how far they move. Here we carry out a first-principles time-dependent calculation to investigate how fast electrons actually move under laser excitation and how large the electron transport affects demagnetization on the shortest time scale. To take into account the transport effect, we implement the intraband transition in our theory. In the bulk fcc Ni, we find the effect of the spin transport on the demagnetization is extremely small, no more than 1%. The collective electron velocity in Ni is 0.4 Å fs-1, much smaller than the Fermi velocity, and the collective displacement is no more than 0.1 Å. But this does not mean that electrons do not travel fast; instead we find that electron velocities at two opposite crystal momenta cancel each other. We follow the Γ-X line and find a huge dispersion in the velocities in the crystal momentum space. In the Fe/W(1 1 0) thin film, the overall demagnetization is larger than Ni, and the Fermi velocity is higher than Ni.

Negotiated coexistence theory posits that neighboring ties between criminal and non-criminal residents reduce social control by increasing the negotiating power of the criminal element. The present study tests whether criminal context moderates the relationship between neighboring and victimization. The effect of neighboring, criminal context, and their interaction on victimization outcomes is estimated while controlling for neighborhood disadvantage using ordinary least squares regression among an urban African American cohort. In support of negotiated coexistence theory, findings show that involvement in neighboring within a criminal context is associated with higher violent victimization among men in young adulthood, while neighboring within a non-criminal context is associated with lower young men’s violent victimization. Yet, this relationship does not hold for men in midlife. In contrast, neighboring is associated with lower property victimization regardless of criminal context for women, in line with social disorganization theory; yet, this relationship was only evident in midlife with no such relationship emerging in young adulthood.",,10.1080/0735648X.2018.1496846,21589119,463,National Institute on Drug Abuse,R01 DA033999,85052055688 (Scopus),0735648X,5,482,2018-10-20,,https://doi.org/10.1080/0735648X.2018.1496846,Journal of Crime and Justice,41

Aims of the current study were (a) to evaluate the effectiveness of video-enabled cue-exposure-based intervention (VE-CEI) in influencing treatment outcomes in alcohol dependence, (b) to identify postdischarge predictors of intervention failure (returning to ≥50% of baseline alcohol consumption quantity/day). The VE-CEI comprises live action videos in which human characters model various alcohol use cues and strategies to deal with them effectively. The VE-CEI was administered to an inpatient alcohol-dependent sample (n = 43) and compared with treatment as usual (TAU) (n = 42) at a government addiction treatment setting in India. Patients were followed up over 6 months postdischarge to evaluate effectiveness of the VE-CEI on specific drinking outcomes. Over 6-month follow-up, VE-CEI group (vs. TAU) reported significantly lesser alcohol consumption quantity, fewer drinking days, and lower intervention failure rates. Results of multivariate Cox regression showed that participants who did not receive VE-CEI had an elevated risk of intervention failure (hazards ratio: 11.14; 95% confidence interval [4.93, 25.15]), other intervention failure predictors being early-onset dependence and increased baseline drinking.

Many of the theory’s hypotheses remain untested, especially its major claim that positive ethnic-racial socialization is the main reason more Black Americans do not offend. The theory argues that positive ethnic-racial socialization inhibits African American offending by attenuating the criminogenic effect of weak social bonds. Using data from a prospective, longitudinal cohort of African Americans from the Woodlawn Project, we test whether these postulations hold for adolescent delinquency and adult offending and find general support: Positive ethnic-racial socialization buffers the effect of weak school bonds on adolescent substance use and adult offending for males, but not females, across most crime types.

A key area of cellular regulation involves the biogenesis of ribosomes. Transcriptional regulation of ribosome biogenesis factor genes through alterations in histone acetylation has been well studied. This work identifies a post-transcriptional mechanism of ribosome biogenesis regulation by Puf protein control of mRNA stability. Puf proteins are eukaryotic mRNA binding proteins that play regulatory roles in mRNA degradation and translation via association with specific conserved elements in the 3ʹ untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNAs and with degradation and translation factors. We demonstrate that several ribosome biogenesis factor mRNAs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae containing a canonical Puf4p element in their 3ʹ UTRs are destabilized by Puf2p, Puf4, and Puf5p, yet stabilized by Puf1p and Puf3p. In the absence of all Puf proteins, these ribosome biogenesis mRNAs are destabilized by a secondary mechanism involving the same 3ʹ UTR element. Unlike other targets of Puf4p regulation, the decay of these transcripts is not altered by carbon source. Overexpression of Puf4p results in delayed ribosomal RNA processing and altered ribosomal subunit trafficking. These results represent a novel role for Puf proteins in yeast as regulators of ribosome biogenesis transcript stability.",,10.1080/15476286.2018.1521211,15558584,1228,National Science Foundation,MCB-0848078,85053870446 (Scopus),15476286,9,1243,2018-09-02,30251908.0,https://doi.org/10.1080/15476286.2018.1521211,RNA Biology,15

Rereading assent in critical literacy research with young children,-,-,-,-,-,-,https://doi.org/10.1177/1468798416675503,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85050990768,"Children’s perspectives, critical literacy events, early childhood literacy, methodology, pedagogic discourse","Literacy researchers often include young children in the research process. Yet discussions about the complexities of gaining and keeping assent are often missing in research reports. In this paper, we report on our attempts to make the assent process, a typical requirement for Institutional Review Boards, an educative experience for children in a critical literacy Kindergarten classroom. We asked: When assent is treated as a text to be read, revisited, interpreted and negotiated, what meanings are made by young children? We designed research lessons and collected artefacts of students’ learning, including interviews. Our analysis traced children’s developing recognition and critical analysis of concepts such as voluntary participation, understanding of procedures, confidentiality, benefits and risks of the study, and the right to ask questions. We found that when assent is treated as an educative process, particularly in the context of critical literacy education, young children learn and make meaning about their rights and responsibilities as participants. We present evidence of meaning-making, transfer and voluntariness of each ethical concept.

Design: This quantitative study was part of a longitudinal, quasi-experimental program of research. Setting: Interventions were conducted on site at facilities provided by participating pre-licensure nursing programs. Participants: A total of 129 nursing students enrolled in their final academic year in three traditional format, pre-licensure nursing programs in the Midwestern United States were recruited to participate in this study. Methods: A cognitive rehearsal intervention was delivered to increase self-efficacy to respond to disruptive behaviors in the nursing workplace. Data were collected in writing immediately prior to and following the intervention. Three months later, data were collected in electronic format through a link sent by text message to their mobile phones. Study data were collected on the Self-efficacy to Respond to Disruptive Behaviors Survey, a 10-point Likert scale measuring self-efficacy and its dimensions: knowledge, previous behavioral engagement, affect, and motivation toward responding effectively to disruptive behaviors. Results: 129 students completed the surveys at pre and post-test; 109 completed the survey three months later. Measures of overall self-efficacy and knowledge (p < 0.000), and both measures of situational self-efficacy (p = 0.002; p = 0.020) remained significantly increased three months after the intervention, compared to pre-test. Past behaviors increased on post-test but returned to baseline at the three-month follow-up. The intervention did not significantly impact affect scores. Changes in motivation toward effective responses were mixed between measurements immediately following the intervention and three months later.

Purpose: The objective of the current study was to examine the contribution of trauma exposure types to RSB—substance-related RSB and partner-related RSB identified through factor analysis—in young Black and White adult women. Methods: We investigated the associations of multiple trauma types and RSB factor scores in participants from a general population sample of young adult female twins (n = 2,948). We examined the independent relationship between specific traumas and RSB, adjusting for substance use, psychopathology, and familial covariates. All pertinent constructs were coded positive only if they occurred before sexual debut. Results: In Black women, sexual abuse was significantly associated with substance-related and partner-related RSB, but retained significance only for partner-related RSB in a fully adjusted model. For White women, sexual abuse and physical abuse were associated with both RSB factors in the base and fully adjusted models. Witnessing injury or death was only associated with RSBs in base models. For both groups, initiating alcohol (for Black women), alcohol, or cannabis (for White women) before sexual debut (i.e., early exposure) was associated with the greatest increased odds of RSB. Conclusions: Data highlight the contribution of prior sexual abuse to RSBs for both White and Black women, and of prior physical abuse to RSBs for White women. Findings have implications for intervention after physical and sexual abuse exposure to prevent RSB, and thus, potentially reduce sexually transmitted infection/human immunodeficiency virus infection and unintended pregnancy in young women.",,10.1016/j.whi.2018.04.011,18784321,421,National Institute on Drug Abuse,K02DA032573,85048277263 (Scopus),10493867,5,429,2018-09-01,29903544.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.whi.2018.04.011,Women's Health Issues,28

We first performed phylogenetic analyses using the mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b) gene to determine relationships among parasite lineages. Then, we estimated divergence times and reconstructed ancestral areas to uncover how landscape evolution has shaped the diversification of Parahaemoproteus and Plasmodium in Amazonia. Finally, we assessed the coevolutionary patterns of diversification in this host–parasite system to determine how coevolution may have influenced the contemporary diversity of avian malaria parasites and their distribution among Amazonian birds. Biogeographic analysis of 324 haemosporidian parasite lineages recovered from 4178 individual birds provided strong evidence that these parasites readily disperse across major Amazonian rivers and this has occurred with increasing frequency over the last five million years. We also recovered many duplication events within areas of endemism in Amazonia.

Less research has been devoted to whether event centrality is related to adaptive outcomes, such as posttraumatic growth (PTG) and resiliency, and psychological well-being (PWB) has not been investigated. Given the unique circumstances of different types of traumas, the relationship between event centrality and posttrauma functioning may differ by the type of trauma experienced. Method: The present study investigated the direct relationships between event centrality and PTSD, depression, PTG, resiliency, and PWB, and then examined whether type of trauma (i.e., sexual victimization, death of a loved one, serious illness/injury, violence exposure) moderated the relationship between event centrality and mental health outcomes among 429 trauma-exposed college students (Mage = 19.66, SD = 1.65; 78.6% female; 49.9% White). Results: Event centrality was positively related to PTSD, depression, and PTG, inversely linked with multiple indices of PWB, and unrelated to resiliency. Type of traumatic event moderated the relationship between event centrality and PTSD, as well as 4 subscales of PWB. When sexual trauma was the index event, event centrality was more strongly associated with PTSD and aspects of PWB compared to death of a loved one.

Thematic analysis consisted of open coding through the theoretical lenses of critical literacy and critical race theory. Findings: Pre-service English language arts teachers largely thought that while race and police relations was important and the YA book was powerful, it was too political. Their fears about what might happen lead to privileging the role of neutrality as the desired goal for teachers when tackling difficult conversations about racial injustice in America. Although students made some shifts in terms of moving from neutral to more critical stances, three sub-themes of neutrality were predominant: a need for both sides of the story, the view that all beliefs are valid and the belief that we are all humans therefore all lives matter equally.

We performed NQ and FS brain volume measurements on 60 subjects (including normal controls, patients with traumatic brain injury, and patients with Alzheimer's disease). We used two statistical approaches in parallel to develop methods for transforming FS volumes into NQ volumes: traditional linear regression, and Bayesian linear regression. For both methods, we used regression analyses to develop linear transformations of the FS volumes to make them more similar to the NQ volumes. The FS-to-NQ transformations based on traditional linear regression resulted in effect sizes which were small to moderate. The transformations based on Bayesian linear regression resulted in all effect sizes being trivially small.

This study assessed differences in anisotropic diffusion measurement across four scanners using a human and a novel phantom developed in conjunction with the Chronic Effects of Neurotrauma Consortium. Method: Human scans provided measurement within biological tissue, and the novel physical phantom provided measures of anisotropic intra-tubular diffusion to serve as a model for intra-axonal water diffusion. Intra- and inter-scanner measurement variances were compared, and the impact on effect size was calculated. Results: Intra-scanner test–retest reliability estimates for fractional anisotropy (FA) demonstrated relative stability over testing intervals. The human tissue and phantom showed similar FA ranges, high linearity and large within-device effect sizes. However, inter-scanner measures of FA indicated substantial differences, some of which exceeded typical DTI effect sizes in mild TBI.

Three major groups are recognized in Piper, i.e., the Neotropical, Asian and South Pacific. Unlike Neotropical Piper, relationships in the Paleotropical Piper remain enigmatic. This study evaluates the relationships within Paleotropical Piper by focusing sampling efforts in the Malesian region. This is the center of diversity of the genus in the Paleotropics, yet has been barely represented in previous phylogenetic studies. Eleven out of 14 infrageneric groups in Paleotropical Piper and 14% of the species were included in this study and their phylogenetic relationships were inferred based on nuclear (ITS, g3pdh) and chloroplast (trnL-F) regions. The goals were to test the monophyly of infrageneric groups, to examine how the main characters used to delimit these infrageneric groups have shaped classifications past and present, and to understand the origin of bisexual flowers and the shrubby habit in the predominantly dioecious Asian clade of climbers. The results show that the Asian clade is monophyletic in all phylogenies and the South Pacific clade is monophyletic in nuclear phylogenies. Within the Asian clade, species predominantly distributed west of Wallace’s Line (WWL) form a moderately/strongly supported clade in the ITS phylogeny, embedded within a grade of species from east of Wallace’s Line (EWL). The ITS phylogeny also resolves 12 and 5 clades in the WWL clade and the EWL grade, respectively. G3pdh and trnL-F phylogenies resolve some of the same clades, but some relationships among and within clades are incongruent. Almost no currently recognized infrageneric groups in Asian Piper are monophyletic. Most of the characters previously used to delimit infrageneric groups are homoplasious, including fruit type, bract type, direction of anther dehiscence, and number of anther valves. However, bract and fruit types are still of some value in that many clades in the Asian Piper are characterized by single bract and fruit types.

We evaluated the sustainability of leaf harvest in one of the most important Cerrado tree species, Stryphnodendron adstringens. The bark of this tree is used as a source of medicinal tannin. Harvesting bark, however, often kills the tree. In a manipulative field experiment, we tested the hypothesis that harvesting leaves, which might serve as an alternative source of tannin, would be less detrimental for tree survival, growth, reproduction, and defense than harvesting bark. In a two-way crossed experimental design, we either clipped 100% of a plant’s leaves or applied NPK fertilizer to the soil. Our predictions of the experimental outcomes were based on plant resource and defense theory. Growth was determined by total leaf dry mass production, reproduction by inflorescence and fruit production traits, and defense by total phenolics, hydrolyzable tannins, and condensed tannins. Fertilization had a marginally positive effect on total leaf dry mass. Defoliation had no effect on subsequent leaf production, and most importantly, no plants died as a result of defoliation. We found high tannin amounts in leaves of S. adstringens produced both prior to and subsequent to clipping, further suggesting that leaves could serve as a sustainable alternative source of tannin. After clipping, plants invested more in tannin production and less in reproduction. Our results suggest that leaf harvest may be more sustainable than harvesting of bark in S. adstringens.

The interventions are brief, low cost, and effective because they target specific psychological processes that cause disinterest, disengagement, and poor performance in STEM education. Interventions promoting a growth mindset address needs for competence and confidence. Communal goal interventions portray STEM as fulfilling communal values. Utility-value interventions highlight the usefulness and value of STEM education in students’ lives and careers. Values-affirmation interventions can buffer negative effects of social identity threat by reaffirming one’s personal values.

We provide evidence that these three isomers populate similar fragmentation pathways to produce the abundant cross-ring cleavage peaks (0,2A1 and 0,3A1). These pathways are highly consistent with the prior literature (Hofmeister et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 113, 5964–5970, 1991, Bythell et al. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 28, 688–703, 2017, Rabus et al.

However, the structure-specific energetics and rate-determining steps of these reactions differ as a function of precursor sugar and anomeric configuration. The lowest energy water loss pathways involve loss of the anomeric oxygen to furnish B1 ions. For glucose and galactose, the lithiated α-anomers generate ketone structures at C2 in a concerted reaction involving a 1,2-migration of the C2-H to the anomeric carbon (C1). In contrast, the β-anomers are predicted to form 1,3-anhydroglucose/galactose B1 ion structures. Initiation of the water loss reactions from each anomeric configuration requires distinct reactive conformers, resulting in different product ion structures. Inversion of the stereochemistry at C2 has marked consequences. Both lithiated mannose forms expel water to form 1,2-anhydromannose B1 ions with the newly formed epoxide group above the ring. Additionally, provided water loss is not instantaneous, the α-anomer can also isomerize to generate a ketone structure at C2 in a concerted reaction involving a 1,2-migration of the C2-H to C1. This product is indistinguishable to that from α-glucose. The energetics and interplay of these pathways are discussed.

Using the dissociation of 1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]-pyridines from the focal adhesion kinase as an example, this work finds that steered molecular dynamics simulations could help screen compounds with long-residence times. It also reveals a two-step mechanism of ligand dissociation resembling the release of ADP from protein kinase A reported earlier. A phenyl group attaching to the pyrrole prolongs residence time by creating a large activation barrier for transition from the bound to the intermediate state when it becomes exposed to the solvent. Principal component analysis shows that ligand dissociation does not couple with large-scale collective motions of the protein involving many of its amino acids. Rather, a small subset of amino acids dominates. Some of these amino acids do not contact the ligands directly along the dissociation pathways and could exert long-range allosteric effects. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,10.1002/jcc.25201,1096987X,1307,University of Missouri,,85042588648 (Scopus),01928651,19,1318,2018-07-15,29498075.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcc.25201,Journal of Computational Chemistry,39

Methods: Fifty healthy control children and 51 vertically infected children were included in the study. The HIV-infected group consisted of survivors who had not received antiretroviral therapy at birth. The HIV-infected group averaged 11.4 (2.5) years of age, with a median CD4 count of 683 cells/mm3. Most (71%) of the HIV-infected children were on antiretroviral therapy for a median of 34 months (range: 33–42) with HIV RNA <40 copies/mL in 89% of the sample.

The concept of polycentricity has been at the center of recent debates in environmental governance. While most of this work has analyzed polycentric arrangements in relation to collaborative and adaptive governance, some have recently focused on how political conflicts shape these arrangements. In this paper we build on this work through Luther Gerlach's forgotten framework of polycentric social movements to undertake the task of politicizing polycentricity. This task entails expanding the analytical focus of institutional analyses of polycentricity and examining the social group politics of social movements. To this end, we present a case study of the climate justice movement and its relation to climate change governance. We analyze whether and to what extent the movement has embodied polycentric arrangements throughout its history, and to what effects. We show that show that, in seeking to address the multiscalar nature of environmental problems and the limits of existing institutional arrangements, climate justice groups are increasingly organized in a polycentric fashion. Climate justice groups mobilize multiple strands of environmental justice movements from the global North and South, as well as from indigenous and peasant rights movements, and it is organized as a decentralized network of semiautonomous, coordinated units. We find that this strategy generates new opportunities and challenges for the movement, and thus has important implications for its effectiveness in achieving these transformations. Lastly, we find that through these polycentric arrangements, movements such as that for climate justice are able to exert simultaneous influence on multiple sites of environmental governance, from the local to the global, furthering increased polycentricity in formal institutional arrangements.",,10.1002/eet.1815,17569338,284,,,85052525808 (Scopus),1756932X,4,294,2018-07-01,,https://doi.org/10.1002/eet.1815,Environmental Policy and Governance,28

When the N concentration was below 0.4 wt%, the plateau pressures increased with increasing N concentration during absorption and desorption and vanadium samples (body-centered cubic (BCC)) transformed to VH0.5 (body-centered tetragonal (BCT), c/a = 1.1) and then VH2 (face-centered cubic (FCC)). When the N concentration exceeded 0.6 wt%, a new single-phase region appeared in the pressure-composition isotherm, suggesting the formation of a new hydride phase. The X-ray diffraction data indicated that this new hydride phase was VH1.0 with a BCT structure and c/a = 1.24, and the phase transformation took place as V (BCC) became VH0.5 (BCT, c/a = 1.1), followed by VH1.0 (BCT, c/a = 1.24) and then VH2 (FCC). Density functional theory calculations indicated that the BCT structure model with hydrogen atoms fully occupying the octahedral sites (denoted as the Oz site) can explain the experimentally obtained crystal structure for VH1.0; they also indicated that the VH1.0 phase was stabilized by the addition of nitrogen. In addition, the N occupation site changed from the Oz site in VH0.5 and VH1.0 to the tetrahedral site (denoted as the T site) in VH2 in coordination with hydrogen during hydrogen absorption.

These cargo-holding vesicles mediate cell-to-cell communication and have recently been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The two types of EVs are distinguished by the mechanism of cell release and their size, with the smaller exosomes and the larger MVs ranging from 30 to 100 nm and 100 nm to 1 μm in diameter, respectively. MV numbers are increased in AD and appear to interact with amyloid-β peptide (Aβ), the primary protein component of the neuritic plaques in the AD brain. Because microglial cells play such an important role in AD-linked neuroinflammation, we sought to characterize MVs shed from microglial cells, better understand MV interactions with Aβ, and determine whether internalized Aβ may be incorporated into secreted MVs. Multiple strategies were used to characterize MVs shed from BV-2 microglia after ATP stimulation. Confocal images of isolated MVs bound to fluorescently labeled annexin-V via externalized phosphatidylserine revealed a polydisperse population of small spherical structures. Dynamic light scattering measurements yielded MV diameters ranging from 150 to 600 nm. Electron microscopy of resin-embedded MVs cut into thin slices showed well-defined uranyl acetate-stained ring-like structures in a similar diameter range. The use of a fluorescently labeled membrane insertion probe, NBD C6-HPC, effectively tracked MVs in binding experiments, and an Aβ ELISA confirmed a strong interaction between MVs and Aβ protofibrils but not Aβ monomers. Despite the lesser monomer interaction, MVs had an inhibitory effect on monomer aggregation. Primary microglia rapidly internalized Aβ protofibrils, and subsequent stimulation of the microglia with ATP resulted in the release of MVs containing the internalized Aβ protofibrils. The role of MVs in neurodegeneration and inflammation is an emerging area, and further knowledge of MV interaction with Aβ may shed light on extracellular spread and influence on neurotoxicity and neuroinflammation.",,10.1021/acschemneuro.8b00029,19487193,1416,,,85048776985 (Scopus),,6,1425,2018-06-20,29543435.0,https://doi.org/10.1021/acschemneuro.8b00029,ACS Chemical Neuroscience,9

Here, we explore the properties of a new lidar-derived index, the large tree canopy area (LCA) defined as the area occupied by canopy above a reference height. We hypothesize that this simple measure of forest structure representing the crown area of large canopy trees could consistently explain the landscape variations in forest volume and aboveground biomass (AGB) across a range of climate and edaphic conditions. To test this hypothesis, we assembled a unique dataset of high-resolution airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) and ground inventory data in nine undisturbed old-growth Neotropical forests, of which four had plots large enough (1 ha) to calibrate our model. We found that the LCA for trees greater than 27 m (∼ 25-30 m) in height and at least 100 m2 crown size in a unit area (1 ha), explains more than 75 % of total forest volume variations, irrespective of the forest biogeographic conditions. When weighted by average wood density of the stand, LCA can be used as an unbiased estimator of AGB across sites (<i>R</i>2 Combining double low line 0.78, RMSE Combining double low line 46.02 Mg haĝ'1, bias Combining double low line ĝ'0.63 Mg haĝ'1). Unlike other lidar-derived metrics with complex nonlinear relations to biomass, the relationship between LCA and AGB is linear and remains unique across forest types. A comparison with tree inventories across the study sites indicates that LCA correlates best with the crown area (or basal area) of trees with diameter greater than 50 cm. The spatial invariance of the LCA-AGB relationship across the Neotropics suggests a remarkable regularity of forest structure across the landscape and a new technique for systematic monitoring of large trees for their contribution to AGB and changes associated with selective logging, tree mortality and other types of tropical forest disturbance and dynamics.",,10.5194/bg-15-3377-2018,17264189,3377,National Science Foundation,NE/P004512/1,85048321096 (Scopus),17264170,11,3390,2018-06-08,,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-3377-2018,Biogeosciences,15

This work contributes to the desistance literature by focusing on within-group heterogeneity among black women, and examining whether variation in the structural position (measured at both distal and proximate points in the life course) conditions the relationship between a well-recognized correlate of desistance—marriage—and offending. Methods: The sample of 636 black females is drawn from the Woodlawn project, a longitudinal, interdisciplinary study of social adaptation, psychological well-being, and crime in a Chicago community cohort of black Americans who were in first grade in 1966. To test for potential moderating effects of structural position on the marriage-offending link, we employ hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) to simultaneously estimate variation in crime within-individuals while accounting for between-individual differences in offending. Results: Findings suggest that both childhood and adult measures of structural position condition the marriage-offending link in important ways. Most notably, black women who are more socioeconomically disadvantaged reap greater benefits from marriage—in the form of a reduced probability of offending—than their more advantaged counterparts. Conclusion: To the degree that women’s pathways to offending are shaped by their socioeconomic marginalization, the practical benefits of marriage (e.g., economic improvement) might surpass other traditionally recognized mechanisms of desistance (e.g., social bonds) in their importance.

However, selection looms large in this line of research, and it has been argued that estimates of neighborhood effects are biased because people nonrandomly select into neighborhoods based on their preferences, income, and the availability of alternative housing. We propose a two-step framework to disentangle selection processes in the relationship between neighborhood deprivation and earnings. We model neighborhood selection using a conditional logit model, from which we derive correction terms. Driven by the recognition that most households prefer certain types of neighborhoods rather than specific areas, we employ a principle components analysis to reduce these terms into eight correction components. We use these to adjust parameter estimates from a model of subsequent neighborhood effects on individual income for the unequal probability that a household chooses to live in a particular type of neighborhood. We apply this technique to administrative data from the Netherlands. After we adjust for the differential sorting of households into certain types of neighborhoods, the effect of neighborhood income on individual income diminishes but remains significant. These results further emphasize that researchers need to be attuned to the role of selection bias when assessing the role of neighborhood effects on individual outcomes. Perhaps more importantly, the persistent effect of neighborhood deprivation on subsequent earnings suggests that neighborhood effects reflect more than the shared characteristics of neighborhood residents: place of residence partially determines economic well-being.",,10.1007/s13524-018-0672-9,15337790,1069,Seventh Framework Programme,FP/2007-2013,85046697653 (Scopus),00703370,3,1090,2018-06-01,29744823.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13524-018-0672-9,Demography,55

In this study, we argue that the more voters are exposed to media coverage of voter fraud allegations, the more likely that they will perceive that voter fraud is a frequent problem. We merge the 2012 Survey of Performance of American Elections with state-level media coverage of voter fraud leading up to the 2012 election. Our results show that media coverage of voter fraud is associated with public beliefs about voter fraud. In states where fraud was more frequently featured in local media outlets, public concerns about voter fraud were heightened. In particular, we find that press attention to voter fraud has a larger influence on Republicans than Democrats and Independents. We further find that media coverage of voter fraud does not further polarize partisan perceptions of voter fraud. Rather, political interest moderates state media coverage on voter fraud beliefs only among Republicans.

The MOQI was one of 7 program sites in the US, with specific interventions unique to each site tested for the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services Innovations Center. While the goals of the MOQI for long-stay nursing home residents did not specifically include improvement of the QM scores, it was anticipated that improvement most likely would occur. Primary goals of the MOQI were to reduce the frequency of avoidable hospital admissions and readmissions; improve resident health outcomes; improve the process of transitioning between inpatient hospitals and nursing facilities; and reduce overall healthcare spending without restricting access to care or choice of providers. Methods: A 2-group comparison analysis was conducted using statewide QMs; a matched comparison group was selected from facilities in the same counties as the intervention homes, similar baseline QM scores, similar size and ownership. MOQI nursing homes each had an APRN embedded full-time to improve care and help the facility achieve MOQI goals. Part of their clinical work with residents and staff was to focus on quality improvement strategies with potential to influence healthcare outcomes. Trajectories of QM scores for the MOQI intervention nursing homes and matched comparison group homes were tested with nonparametric tests to examine for change in the desired direction between the 2 groups from baseline to 36 months. A composite QM score for each facility was constructed, and baseline to 36-month average change scores were examined using nonparametric tests. Then, adjusting for baseline, a repeated measures analysis using analysis of covariance as conducted. Results: Composite QM scores of the APRN intervention group were significantly better (P =.025) than the comparison group. The repeated measures analysis identified statistically significant group by time interaction (P =.012). Then group comparisons were made at each of the 6-month intervals and statistically significant differences were found at 24 months (P =.042) and 36 months (P =.002), and nearly significant at 30 months (P =.11). Implications: APRNs working full time in nursing homes can positively influence quality of care, and their impact can be measured on improving QMs. As more emphasis is placed on quality and outcomes for nursing home services, providers need to find successful strategies to improve their QMs. Results of these analyses reveal the positive impact on QM outcomes for the majority of the MOQI nursing homes, indicating budgeting for APRN services can be a successful strategy.",,10.1016/j.jamda.2017.10.014,15389375,541,Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,,85036507497 (Scopus),15258610,6,550,2018-06-01,29208447.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2017.10.014,Journal of the American Medical Directors Association,19

The article aims to demonstrate that meaning in fiction can be incorporated in an explanatory network that includes the whole scope of human behavior. In both reality and fiction, meaning consists of experiences in individual minds: sensations, emotions, perceptions, and thoughts. Writing and reading fiction involve 3 sets of minds, those of authors, readers, and characters. Meaning in the minds of authors and readers emerges in relation to the experiences of fictional characters. Characters engage in motivated actions. To understand minds and meaning in fiction, researchers need analytic categories for human motives. A comprehensive model of human motives can be constructed by integrating ideas from evolutionary biology, anthropology, and psychology. Motives combine in different ways to produce different cultures and different individual identities, which influence experience in individual minds.

It also examines whether this relationship depends on the type of encounter (citizen-initiated contacts, routine vehicle stops, invasive encounters associated with being a suspect), its perceived justness, or victim characteristics. Among victims who did not notify the police, the reasons behind this decision are assessed to understand the mechanisms through which police encounters are related to reporting. Methods: This research is the first to use longitudinal data that link the 2002, 2008, and 2011 Police Public Contact Surveys to the 2002–2014 National Crime Victimization Surveys. Multivariate logistic regression is used to examine the effect of prior contact on police notification among victims of personal (N = 1073) and household (N = 11,433) crimes. Results: Prior contact with the police has no main effect on the reporting of personal crimes; however, the negative effects of police-initiated and unjust contact are amplified for the poor and African Americans. The reporting of household crimes varies based on prior police experiences and whether they were viewed as just. Personal crime victims with invasive contact are more likely than other contact groups to attribute non-reporting to fear of reprisal.

Both the N-doped/undoped nanoconfined systems demonstrate improved reversibility in relation to the bulk hydride during hydrogen desorption/absorption cycling. Isothermal kinetic measurements indicate a lowering of the activation energy for H2 desorption by as much as 70 kJ/mol in N-doped frameworks, far larger than the reduction in carbon-only frameworks. Most interestingly, this dramatic lowering of the activation energy is accompanied by an unexpected and anomalously low NaAlH4 desorption rate in the N-doped frameworks. This suggests that the framework surface chemistry plays an important role in the desorption process and that the rate limiting step for desorption may be associated with interactions of the hydride and host surface.

Methods Risky decision making, measured via the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), was compared voxel-wise to resting cerebral blood flow (rCBF) acquired via arterial spin labeling. Separate topographical maps were obtained for HIV-uninfected (HIV -; n = 62) and HIV + (n = 41) young adults (18-24 years old) and were compared to the full cohort of participants. For the HIV + group, rCBF was compared to recent and nadir CD4. Results IGT performance was supported by rCBF in 3 distinct brain regions: regions I, II, and III. The relationship between IGT performance and rCBF in HIV + individuals was most robust in region I, the ventromedial prefrontal and insular cortices. Region II contained strong relationships for both HIV - and HIV +. Region III, dorsolateral prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices, contained relationships that were strongest for HIV - controls. IGT performance was intact among HIV + participants with higher rCBF in either region I or region III. By contrast, performance was worse among HIV + individuals with lower rCBF in both regions I and III when compared to HIV - controls (P =.01). rCBF in region III was reduced in HIV + compared with HIV - individuals (P =.04), and positively associated with nadir CD4 cell count (P =.02). Conclusions Recruitment of executive systems (region III) mitigates risk-taking behavior in HIV + and HIV - individuals. Recruitment of reward systems (region I) mitigates risk-taking behavior when region III is disrupted due to immunological compromise.

Second, to explore illness perceptions as a mediator of the association between congenital heart disease (CHD) diagnosis and QOL. Design: Cross-sectional observational study. Setting: Twenty-four cardiology centers from 15 countries across five continents. Patients: Four hundred thirty-five adult patients with congenital heart disease (177 Fontan and 258 ASD/VSD) ages 18-83 years. Outcome Measures: QOL and illness perceptions were assessed by the Satisfaction With Life Scale and the Brief Illness Perceptions Questionnaire, respectively. Results: Patients with a Fontan circulation reported lower QOL (Wald Z = −3.59, p = <.001) and more negative perceptions of their CHD (Wald Z = −7.66, p <.001) compared with patients with ASD/VSD. After controlling for demographics, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and New York Heart Association functional class, path analyses revealed a significant mediation model, αβ = 0.15, p =.002, 95% CI = 0.06-0.25, such that CHD diagnosis was indirectly related to QOL through illness perceptions. Conclusions: The Fontan sample's more negative perceptions of CHD were likely a reflection of life with a more complex defect.

DNCON2: Improved protein contact prediction using two-level deep convolutional neural networks,OA,-,Hybrid Gold OA,-,Green Final OA,Green Accepted OA,https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btx781,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85047095484,,"Motivation Significant improvements in the prediction of protein residue-residue contacts are observed in the recent years. These contacts, predicted using a variety of coevolution-based and machine learning methods, are the key contributors to the recent progress in ab initio protein structure prediction, as demonstrated in the recent CASP experiments. Continuing the development of new methods to reliably predict contact maps is essential to further improve ab initio structure prediction. Results In this paper we discuss DNCON2, an improved protein contact map predictor based on two-level deep convolutional neural networks. It consists of six convolutional neural networks - the first five predict contacts at 6, 7.5, 8, 8.5 and 10 Å distance thresholds, and the last one uses these five predictions as additional features to predict final contact maps. On the free-modeling datasets in CASP10, 11 and 12 experiments, DNCON2 achieves mean precisions of 35, 50 and 53.4%, respectively, higher than 30.6% by MetaPSICOV on CASP10 dataset, 34% by MetaPSICOV on CASP11 dataset and 46.3% by Raptor-X on CASP12 dataset, when top L/5 long-range contacts are evaluated. We attribute the improved performance of DNCON2 to the inclusion of short- and medium-range contacts into training, two-level approach to prediction, use of the state-of-the-art optimization and activation functions, and a novel deep learning architecture that allows each filter in a convolutional layer to access all the input features of a protein of arbitrary length.

However, some sources of public beliefs about voter fraud have received little attention. We identify two conditions that combine to make anti-immigrant attitudes a strong predictor of voter fraud beliefs. First, the recent growth and dispersion of the immigrant population makes immigration a salient consideration for many Americans. Second, an immigrant threat narrative in political discourse linking immigration to crime and political dysfunction has been extended to the voting domain. Using new data from a survey module in the 2014 Cooperative Congressional Election Study and the 2012 American National Election Study, we show that immigrant resentment is strongly associated with voter fraud beliefs. Widespread hostility toward immigrants helps nourish public beliefs about voter fraud and support for voting restrictions in the United States. The conditions generating this relationship in public opinion likely exist in other nations roiled by immigration politics. The topic of fraudulent electoral practices will likely continue to provoke voters to call to mind groups that are politically constructed as “un-American.”.",,10.1177/1532673X17722988,15523373,402,University of Missouri-St. Louis,1430505,85044818315 (Scopus),1532673X,3,433,2018-05-01,,https://doi.org/10.1177/1532673X17722988,American Politics Research,46

The rationale, in part, is that when people have more favorable perceptions of their police encounters, they view the police as more just and are more willing to cooperate and comply with the law. To assess whether perceptions of police-initiated encounters shape law-related outcomes, we examine how satisfaction with treatment during prior police contact affects procedural injustice, reporting intentions, norms supporting the use of violence, and delinquency. We also explore whether these relationships vary among Blacks, Whites, and Latinos. Our results indicate that youth who have been stopped or arrested fare worse than their counterparts with no police-initiated contact; however, the potentially negative ramifications of these encounters on all outcomes except violence norms are generally mitigated when youth are satisfied with their treatment. The effects of contact are mostly invariant across racial/ethnic groups when a robust set of control variables are included. We conclude that changing the perceptions of youth regarding how they are treated by the police may mitigate some of the harms of being stopped or arrested, but we caution that these perceptions are shaped by factors aside from police behavior during encounters.",,10.1111/1745-9125.12174,17459125,402,National Institute of Justice,2006-JV-FX-0011,85043454737 (Scopus),00111384,2,432,2018-05-01,,https://doi.org/10.1111/1745-9125.12174,Criminology,56

During the late Quaternary, notably during the Late Pleistocene and the early Holocene, Earth experienced a rapid extinction of large, terrestrial vertebrates. While much attention has been paid to understanding the causes of this massive megafauna extinction, less attention has been given to understanding the impacts of loss of megafauna on other organisms with whom they interacted. In this review, we discuss how the loss of megafauna disrupted and reshaped ecological interactions, and explore the ecological consequences of the ongoing decline of large vertebrates. Numerous late Quaternary extinct species of predators, parasites, commensals and mutualistic partners were associated with megafauna and were probably lost due to their strict dependence upon them (co-extinctions). Moreover, many extant species have megafauna-adapted traits that provided evolutionary benefits under past megafauna-rich conditions, but are now of no or limited use (anachronisms). Morphological evolution and behavioural changes allowed some of these species partially to overcome the absence of megafauna. Although the extinction of megafauna led to a number of co-extinction events, several species that likely co-evolved with megafauna established new interactions with humans and their domestic animals. Species that were highly specialized in interactions with megafauna, such as large predators, specialized parasites, and large commensalists (e.g. scavengers, dung beetles), and could not adapt to new hosts or prey were more likely to die out. Partners that were less megafauna dependent persisted because of behavioural plasticity or by shifting their dependency to humans via domestication, facilitation or pathogen spill-over, or through interactions with domestic megafauna. We argue that the ongoing extinction of the extant megafauna in the Anthropocene will catalyse another wave of co-extinctions due to the enormous diversity of key ecological interactions and functional roles provided by the megafauna.",,10.1111/brv.12374,1469185X,845,Villum Fonden,RYC-2015-19231,85030655453 (Scopus),14647931,2,862,2018-05-01,28990321.0,https://doi.org/10.1111/brv.12374,Biological Reviews,93

Almost all traditional fold recognition methods use sequence (homology) comparison to indirectly predict the fold of a target protein based on the fold of a template protein with known structure, which cannot explain the relationship between sequence and fold. Only a few methods had been developed to classify protein sequences into a small number of folds due to methodological limitations, which are not generally useful in practice. Results We develop a deep 1D-convolution neural network (DeepSF) to directly classify any protein sequence into one of 1195 known folds, which is useful for both fold recognition and the study of sequence-structure relationship. Different from traditional sequence alignment (comparison) based methods, our method automatically extracts fold-related features from a protein sequence of any length and maps it to the fold space. We train and test our method on the datasets curated from SCOP1.75, yielding an average classification accuracy of 75.3%. On the independent testing dataset curated from SCOP2.06, the classification accuracy is 73.0%. We compare our method with a top profile-profile alignment method -HHSearch on hard template-based and template-free modeling targets of CASP9-12 in terms of fold recognition accuracy.

The interacting ATPases PEX1 and PEX6 contribute to peroxisome function by recycling PEX5, a cytosolic receptor needed to import proteins targeted to the peroxisomal matrix. Arabidopsis pex6 mutants exhibit low PEX5 levels and defects in peroxisomal matrix protein import, oil body utilization, peroxisomal metabolism, and seedling growth. These defects are hypothesized to stem from impaired PEX5 retrotranslocation leading to PEX5 polyubiquitination and consequent degradation of PEX5 via the proteasome or of the entire organelle via autophagy. We recovered a pex1 missense mutation in a screen for second-site suppressors that restore growth to the pex6-1 mutant. Surprisingly, this pex1-1 mutation ameliorated the metabolic and physiological defects of pex6-1 without restoring PEX5 levels. Similarly, preventing autophagy by introducing an atg7-null allele partially rescued pex6-1 physiological defects without restoring PEX5 levels. atg7 synergistically improved matrix protein import in pex1-1 pex6-1, implying that pex1-1 improves peroxisome function in pex6-1 without impeding autophagy of peroxisomes (i.e., pexophagy). pex1-1 differentially improved peroxisome function in various pex6 alleles but worsened the physiological and molecular defects of a pex26 mutant, which is defective in the tether anchoring the PEX1–PEX6 hexamer to the peroxisome.

Topography and three-dimensional structure can estimate tree diversity along a tropical elevational gradient in Costa Rica,OA,Gold OA,-,-,Green Final OA,Green Accepted OA,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs10040629,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85045974828,"Costa Rica, Lidar, Montane gradient, Neotropical forest, Remote sensing, Tree diversity","This research seeks to understand how tree species richness and diversity relates to field data (1-ha plots) on forest structure (stems, basal area) and lidar derived data on topography and three-dimensional forest structure along an elevational gradient in Braulio Carrillo National Park, Costa Rica. In 2016 we calculated tree species richness and diversity indices for twenty 1-ha plots located along a gradient ranging from 56 to 2814 m in elevation. Field inventory data were combined with large footprint (20 m) airborne lidar data over plots in 2005, in order to quantify variations in topography and three-dimensional structure across plots and landscapes. A distinct pattern revealing an increase in species' richness and the Shannon diversity index was observed in correlation with increasing elevation, up to about 600 m; beyond that, at higher elevations, a decrease was observed. Stem density and basal area both peaked at the 2800 m site, with a mini-peak at 600 m, and were both negatively associated with species richness and diversity. Species richness and diversity were negatively correlated with elevation, while the two tallest relative height metrics (rh100, rh75) derived from lidar were both significantly positively correlated with species richness and diversity. The best lidar-derived topographical and three-dimensional forest structural models showed a strong relationship with the Shannon diversity index (r2 = 0.941, p < 0.01), with ten predictors; conversely, the best species richness model was weaker (r2 = 0.599, p < 0.01), with two predictors. We realize that our high r2 has to be interpreted with caution due to possible overfitting, since we had so few ground plots in which to develop the relationship with the numerous topographical and structural explanatory variables. However, this is still an interesting analysis, even with the issue of overfitting. To reduce issues with overfitting we used ridge regression, which acted as a regularization method, shrinking coefficients in order to decrease their variability and multicollinearity. This study is unique because it uses paired 1-ha plot and airborne lidar data over a tropical elevation gradient, and suggests potential for mapping species richness and diversity across elevational gradients in tropical montane ecosystems using topography and relative height metrics from spaceborne lidar with greater spatial coverage (e.g., GEDI).",629,10.3390/rs10040629,20724292,,,,85045974828 (Scopus),,4,,2018-04-01,,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs10040629,Remote Sensing,10

Nurses often focus on maternal well-being and fail to acknowledge the stress of fathers. Research on fathers' psychological stress is limited. Purpose: A systematic review of the literature was completed to examine the extent of psychological stress and types of stressors in fathers with infants admitted to the NICU. Methods/Search Strategy: A search of Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and EMBASE was conducted to identify descriptive and observational studies reporting father-specific stress in the NICU. Studies using observational and descriptive designs, published in English, and reporting father-specific stress outcomes during a NICU admission were eligible for inclusion. Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines were used for quality assessment. Results: Fifteen studies met inclusion criteria. Fathers find the NICU environment stressful and are more stressed than fathers of full-Term, healthy infants. Parental role alteration, infant appearance, NICU environment, and staff communication are stressors. Implications for Practice/Research: By recognizing the extent and types of psychological stress in fathers, nurses can provide better support for fathers in their new role. Younger fathers and those with very low birth-weight premature infants may need additional support and resources.

Several polyamide molecules have been found to have potent antiviral activities against papillomavirus, a double-stranded DNA virus. By analogy, we reason that polyamides may also interact with the structured RNA bound in the nucleocapsid of a negative-strand RNA virus. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was selected as a prototype virus to test this possibility since its genomic RNA encapsidated in the nucleocapsid forms a structure resembling one strand of an A-form RNA duplex. One polyamide molecule, UMSL1011, was found to inhibit infection of VSV. To confirm that the polyamide targeted the nucleocapsid, a nucleocapsid-like particle (NLP) was incubated with UMSL1011. The encapsidated RNA in the polyamide-treated NLP was protected from thermo-release and digestion by RNase A. UMSL1011 also inhibits viral RNA synthesis in the intracellular activity assay for the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The crystal structure revealed that UMSL1011 binds the structured RNA in the nucleocapsid. The conclusion of our studies is that the RNA in the nucleocapsid is a viable antiviral target of polyamides.

In response to Pi deprivation, one prominent metabolic adaptation in plants is the decrease in membrane phospholipids that consume approximately one-third cellular Pi. The level of two phospholipid-hydrolyzing enzymes, phospholipase Dζ2 (PLDζ2) and non-specific phospholipase C4 (NPC4), is highly induced in Pi-deprived Arabidopsis. To determine the role of PLDζ2 and NPC4 in plant growth under Pi limitation, Arabidopsis plants deficient in both PLDζ2 and NPC4 (npc4pldζ2) were generated and characterized. Lipid remodeling in leaves and roots was analyzed at three different durations of Pi deficiency. NPC4 affected lipid changes mainly in roots at an early stage of Pi deprivation, whereas PLDζ2 exhibited a more overt effect on lipid remodeling in leaves at a later stage of Pi deprivation. Pi deficiency-induced galactolipid increase and phospholipid decrease were impeded in pldζ2 and npc4pldζ2 plants. In addition, seedlings of npc4pldζ2 had the same root hair density as pldζ2 but shorter root hair length than pldζ2 in response to Pi deficiency. The loss of NPC4 decreased root hair length but had no effect on root hair density. These data suggest that PLDζ2 and NPC4 mediate the Pi deprivation-induced lipid remodeling in a tissue- and time-specific manner. PLDζ2 and NPC4 have distinctively different roles in root hair growth and development in response to Pi deprivation; PLDζ2 negatively modulates root hair density and length, whereas NPC4 promotes root hair elongation.",,10.1111/tpj.13858,1365313X,315,National Science Foundation,1007600,85044248789 (Scopus),09607412,2,326,2018-04-01,29437261.0,https://doi.org/10.1111/tpj.13858,Plant Journal,94

We used molecular methods to screen for parasite infections and to identify parasite lineages. To characterize spatial heterogeneity in water availability, we used weather-station and remotely sensed climate data. We estimated parasite prevalence while accounting for spatial autocorrelation, and used a model selection approach to determine the effect of variables related to water availability and host species on prevalence. The prevalence, distribution, and lineage diversity of haemosporidian parasites varied among localities and host species, but we found no support for the hypothesis that the prevalence and diversity of parasites increase with increasing water availability. Host species and host × climate interactions had stronger effects on infection prevalence, and parasite lineages were strongly associated with particular host species.

However, the assumption that PTSD develops from dysregulated fear circuitry possesses limitations that detract from the potential efficacy of CBT approaches. An analysis of these limitations may provide insight into improvements to the CBT approach to PTSD, beginning with an examination of negative affect as an essential component to the conceptualization of PTSD and a barrier to the implementation of CBT for PTSD. As such, the literature regarding the impact of negative affect on aspects of cognition (i.e., attention, processing, memory, and emotion regulation) necessary for the successful application of CBT was systematically reviewed. Several literature databases were explored (e.g., PsychINFO and PubMed), resulting in 25 articles that met criteria for inclusion. Results of the review indicated that high negative affect generally disrupts cognitive processes, resulting in a narrowed focus on stimuli of a negative valence, increased rumination of negative autobiographical memories, inflexible preservation of initial information, difficulty considering counterfactuals, reliance on emotional reasoning, and misinterpretation of neutral or ambiguous events as negative, among others.

An appreciable portion of this literature is concerned with the relationship between impulsivity and delinquency across neighborhood settings. The present article builds upon this growing body of research by considering the more nuanced pathways through which neighborhood disadvantage shapes the development of impulsivity and provides a situational context for impulsive tendencies to manifest in violent and aggressive behaviors. Using a sample of 12,935 adolescent from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) (mean age = 15.3, 51% female; 20% Black, 17% Hispanic), we demonstrate the extent to which variation in the association between impulsivity and delinquency across neighborhoods can be attributed to (1) differences in mean-levels of impulsivity and violence and (2) differences in coefficients across neighborhoods. The results of a series of multivariate regression models indicate that impulsivity is positively associated with self-reported violence, and that this relationship is strongest among youth living in disadvantaged neighborhoods. The moderating effect of neighborhood disadvantage can be attributed primarily to the stronger effect of impulsivity on violence in these areas, while differences in average levels of violence and impulsivity account for a smaller, yet nontrivial portion of the observed relationship. These results indicate that the differential effect of impulsivity on violence can be attributed to both developmental processes that lead to the greater concentration of violent and impulsive adolescents in economically deprived neighborhoods as well as the greater likelihood of impulsive adolescents engaging in violence when they reside in economically disadvantaged communities.",,10.1007/s10964-017-0695-3,15736601,859,University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,P01-HD31921,85019706975 (Scopus),00472891,4,871,2018-04-01,28555293.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10964-017-0695-3,Journal of Youth and Adolescence,47

Other important variables influencing demand elasticity are industry concentration, the stage of production, the existence of protection from domestic and foreign entry, and the extent of new-product introduction in a particular market.

We investigate this trade-off by examining the readability of tax footnotes.

Its larval behavior and possible relationships to the rest of the complex are described and analyzed. Field and laboratory observations revealed that these caterpillars consumed the extrafloral nectar, Beltian bodies, and young foliage of two acacia species (Vachellia collinsii and Vachellia farnesiana; Fabaceae: Mimosoideae). The caterpillars were observed building individual silk webs surrounding a single stem node's thorns and leaf rachises. If open domatia are included in shelters, the caterpillars reside in the domatia between feeding bouts and during pupation. These caterpillars are the only non-myrmecophilous caterpillars known to regularly exploit a host plant's ant rewards. DNA barcoding of the Costa Rican specimens showed that they are significantly different from the United States members of A. corallina (12-13% difference in cox1 sequence). An examination of host plant herbarium material for caterpillar shelters demonstrated likely differences in host plant use, with webs consistent with A. corallina only found on specimens of United States Chamaecrista nictitans (Fabaceae: Caesalpiniodeae), but not Vachellia farnesiana. By contrast, webs were found on V. collinsii, V. cornigera, and V. farnesiana from Central America (including Mexico), but not on Central American C. nictitans.

Role of multiple invasion mechanisms and their interaction in regulating the population dynamics of an exotic tree,OA,-,-,Bronze OA,-,-,https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.13020,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85033227879,"Ailanthus altissima, biotic resistance hypothesis, competition, enemy release hypothesis, exotic species, fire, herbivory, integral projection model, invasive species, population growth","Understanding the mechanisms that allow exotic species to have rapid population growth is an important step in the process of controlling existing invasions and preventing future invasions. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain why some exotic species become invasive, the most prominent of which focus on the roles of habitat disturbance, competitors and consumers. The magnitude and direction of each of these mechanisms on population dynamics observed in previous studies is quite variable. It is possible that some of this variation results from interactions between mechanisms. We examined all of these mechanisms and their interactions on the population dynamics of the Asian exotic tree Ailanthus altissima (Simaroubaceae) in fire-suppressed oak-hickory forests in Missouri, USA. We experimentally reduced herbivory (using insecticide), reduced interspecific competition (plant removals), and manipulated disturbance with prescribed fire. We projected the effects of these treatments and their interactions on population dynamics by parameterizing an integral projection model. The lowest population growth rate is found where fire is absent and biotic interactions are present. Fire increased population growth rate, likely through the suppression of interspecific competitors, since competitor removal treatments increased population growth rate in the absence but not presence of fire.

The first method (MULTICOM-NOVEL) uses only traditional features (sequence profile, secondary structure, and solvent accessibility) with deep learning to predict contacts and serves as a baseline. The second method (MULTICOM-CONSTRUCT) uses our new alignment algorithm to generate deep multiple sequence alignment to derive coevolution-based features, which are integrated by a neural network method to predict contacts. The third method (MULTICOM-CLUSTER) is a consensus combination of the predictions of the first two methods. We evaluated our methods on 94 CASP12 domains. On a subset of 38 free-modeling domains, our methods achieved an average precision of up to 41.7% for top L/5 long-range contact predictions. The comparison of the three methods shows that the quality and effective depth of multiple sequence alignments, coevolution-based features, and machine learning integration of coevolution-based features and traditional features drive the quality of predicted protein contacts. On the full CASP12 dataset, the coevolution-based features alone can improve the average precision from 28.4% to 41.6%, and the machine learning integration of all the features further raises the precision to 56.3%, when top L/5 predicted long-range contacts are evaluated.

At first, we focus on views that attempt to render such ascriptions naturalistic by construing them in a deflationary or merely pragmatic way. We then contrast these views with staunchly realist views that attempt to naturalize intentionality by developing theories of content for representations in terms of information and biological function. We echo several other philosophers by arguing that these theories over-generalize unless they are constrained by a theory of the functional role of representational vehicles. This leads to a discussion of the functional roles of representations, and how representations might be realized in the brain. We argue that there’s work to be done to identify a distinctively mental kind of representation. We close by sketching a way forward for the project of naturalizing intentionality. This will not be achieved simply by ascribing the content of mental states to generic neural representations, but by identifying specific neural representations that explain the puzzling intentional properties of mental states.",,10.1007/s11023-017-9437-2,15728641,119,National Science Foundation,1654982,85019751980 (Scopus),09246495,1,139,2018-03-01,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11023-017-9437-2,Minds and Machines,28

It also explores whether delinquent attitudes form a unidimensional or multidimensional construct. Finally, this study tests Ajzen and Fishbein’s principle of compatibility to determine if delinquent attitudes have a behavior-specific and a situation-specific effect on behavior. Methods: Data from a sample of 223 high school students in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) and from the Gang Resistance Education and Training (GREAT) evaluation are used. The means and correlations between single-item global attitude items are compared to situation-specific measures. Exploratory factor analysis is conducted to examine dimensionality, and logit regressions are used to predict the willingness to offend in the PNW and self-reported offending in the GREAT. Results: The findings indicate that: (1) global attitude measures underestimate the degree of approval of delinquency and are not strongly correlated with situation-specific attitudes; (2) delinquent attitudes form a multidimensional construct that coalesce around crime-types; (3) there is some evidence that attitudes towards specific crimes have crime-specific effects on behavior, and; (4) situation-specific attitudes predict the willingness to offend in a specific situation above and beyond one’s overall approval of that behavior.

We previously reported the discovery of a new class of cyclipostins and cyclophostin (CyC) analogs exhibiting potent activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis both in vitro and in infected macrophages. Competitive labeling/enrichment assays combined with MS have identified several serine or cysteine enzymes in lipid and cell wall metabolism as putative targets of these CyC compounds. These targets included members of the antigen 85 (Ag85) complex (i.e. Ag85A, Ag85B, and Ag85C), responsible for biosynthesis of trehalose dimycolate and mycolylation of arabinogalactan. Herein, we used biochemical and structural approaches to validate the Ag85 complex as a pharmacological target of the CyC analogs. We found that CyC7β, CyC8β, and CyC17 bind covalently to the catalytic Ser124 residue in Ag85C; inhibit mycolyltransferase activity (i.e. the transfer of a fatty acid molecule onto trehalose); and reduce triacylglycerol synthase activity, a property previously attributed to Ag85A. Supporting these results, an X-ray structure of Ag85C in complex with CyC8β disclosed that this inhibitor occupies Ag85C's substrate-binding pocket. Importantly, metabolic labeling of M. Tuberculosis cultures revealed that the CyC compounds impair both trehalose dimycolate synthesis and mycolylation of arabinogalactan. Overall, our study provides compelling evidence that CyC analogs can inhibit the activity of the Ag85 complex in vitro and in mycobacteria, opening the door to a new strategy for inhibiting Ag85.

Tag clouds are a type of visualization that displays the contents of a document as a cluster (cloud) of key words (tags) with frequency (importance) indicated by tag word features such as size or color, with variation of size within a tag cloud being the most common indicator of tag importance. Prior studies have shown that word size is the most influential factor of tag importance and tag memory. Systematic biases in relative size perception in tag clouds are therefore likely to have important implications for viewer understanding of tag cloud visualizations. Significant under- and over-perception of the relative size of tag words were observed, depending on the relative size ratio of the target tag words compared. The qualitative change in the direction of the estimation bias was predicted by a simple power-law model for size perception. This bias in relative size perception was modulated somewhat by a change to a bold typeface, but the typeface effect varied in a complex manner with the size and location of the tags. The results provide a first report of systematic biases in relative size judgment in tag clouds, suggest that, to a first approximation, simple power-law scaling models developed for simple displays containing 1–2 objects on a blank background, may be applicable to relative size judgments in complex tag clouds.

Although our understanding of these parasites' diversity has expanded by analyses of their mitochondrial genes, there is limited information on these genes' evolutionary rates. Here, 114 mitochondrial genomes (mtDNA) were studied from species belonging to four genera: Leucocytozoon, Haemoproteus, Hepatocystis, and Plasmodium. Contrary to previous assertions, the mtDNA is phylogenetically informative. The inferred phylogeny showed that, like the genus Plasmodium, the Leucocytozoon and Haemoproteus genera are not monophyletic groups. Although sensitive to the assumptions of the molecular dating method used, the estimated times indicate that the diversification of the avian haemosporidian subgenera/genera took place after the Cretaceous- Paleogene boundary following the radiation of modern birds. Furthermore, parasite clade differences in mtDNA substitution rates and strength of negative selection were detected. These differences may affect the biological interpretation of mtDNA gene lineages used as a proxy to species in ecological and parasitological investigations. Given that the mitochondria are critically important in the parasite life cycle stages that take place in the vector and that the transmission of parasites belonging to particular clades has been linked to specific insect families/subfamilies, this study suggests that differences in vectors have affected the mode of evolution of haemosporidian mtDNA genes.

Variation in upper thermal limits can occur among and within species, and for social insects such as ants, within colonies. Within colonies, upper thermal limits may differ among individuals or change for an individual throughout the day. Daytime foragers of the Neotropical ant Ectatomma ruidum have higher critical thermal maxima (CTmax) than nocturnal foragers, but whether these differences occur among or within colonies was not previously known. We investigated the potential mechanisms accounting for day/night variation in CTmax of E. ruidum foragers by testing whether CTmax varied among or within colonies or due to individuals within colonies acclimating to changes in temperature over a short time scale (3 h). We found within- but not among-colony differences in CTmax on a diel cycle, and we found no evidence for among- or within-colony partitioning of foraging times by individual workers. Individuals did not acclimate to experimental manipulations of temperature, although additional experiments with more ecologically relevant temperature manipulations are needed to rule out this mechanism. In summary, we have shown that day/night differences in upper thermal limits can occur within ant colonies, but further investigation is needed to elucidate the mechanisms driving this variation.",,10.1007/s00040-017-0585-4,14209098,183,National Science Foundation,DGE-1321846,85030870395 (Scopus),00201812,1,189,2018-02-01,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00040-017-0585-4,Insectes Sociaux,65

But researchers in other disciplines have found that reported expectations are highly susceptible to exogenous factors (e.g., anchors and question ordering), indicating that such values are somewhat arbitrary responses to probabilistic questions. At the same time, reported expectations are coherent within persons, such that respondents rank order them rationally. For deterrence, then, absolute values reported on arrest risks are likely not stable but individuals still rank order specific crimes in meaningful ways. We examine the interpretability of reported arrest risk for three possibilities: 1) Reported risks are stable probabilistic values; 2) reported risks are arbitrary and uninformative for deterrence research; or 3) reported risks display “coherent arbitrariness” with unstable values between individuals but stable rank ordering of crimes within individuals. Through the use of three random experiments of college students, our results indicate that elicited risk perceptions are arbitrary in that they are influenced by the presentation of anchors and question ordering. Nevertheless, the rank ordering of crimes within and across conditions is unaffected by the presentation of anchors, suggesting that reported risks are locally coherent within persons.",,10.1111/1745-9125.12154,17459125,59,,,85030111891 (Scopus),00111384,1,86,2018-02-01,,https://doi.org/10.1111/1745-9125.12154,Criminology,56

However, selection over mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genes has usually been evaluated at the population level. We sequenced by NGS 12 mitogenomes and with four published genomes, assessed genetic variation in ten penguin species distributed from the equator to Antarctica. Signatures of selection of 13 mitochondrial protein-coding genes were evaluated by comparing among species within and among genera (Spheniscus, Pygoscelis, Eudyptula, Eudyptes and Aptenodytes). The genetic data were correlated with environmental data obtained through remote sensing (sea surface temperature [SST], chlorophyll levels [Chl] and a combination of SST and Chl [COM]) through the distribution of these species. Results: We identified the complete mtDNA genomes of several penguin species, including ND6 and 8 tRNAs on the light strand and 12 protein coding genes, 14 tRNAs and two rRNAs positioned on the heavy strand. The highest diversity was found in NADH dehydrogenase genes and the lowest in COX genes. The lowest evolutionary divergence among species was between Humboldt (Spheniscus humboldti) and Galapagos (S. mendiculus) penguins (0.004), while the highest was observed between little penguin (Eudyptula minor) and Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) (0.097). We identified a signature of purifying selection (Ka/Ks < 1) across the mitochondrial genome, which is consistent with the hypothesis that purifying selection is constraining mitogenome evolution to maintain Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) proteins and functionality. Pairwise species maximum-likelihood analyses of selection at codon sites suggest positive selection has occurred on ATP8 (Fixed-Effects Likelihood, FEL) and ND4 (Single Likelihood Ancestral Counting, SLAC) in all penguins. In contrast, COX1 had a signature of strong negative selection. ND4 Ka/Ks ratios were highly correlated with SST (Mantel, p-value: 0.0001; GLM, p-value: 0.00001) and thus may be related to climate adaptation throughout penguin speciation. Conclusions: These results identify mtDNA candidate genes under selection which could be involved in broad-scale adaptations of penguins to their environment. Such knowledge may be particularly useful for developing predictive models of how these species may respond to severe climatic changes in the future.",53,10.1186/s12864-017-4424-9,14712164,,National Science Foundation,04/2008,85040716488 (Scopus),,1,,2018-01-16,29338715.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-017-4424-9,BMC Genomics,19

While the public wondered whether the nude figure indeed represented Cléo de Mérode, a rising star in the ballet of the Opéra de Paris, art critics reacted with unusual vehemence to the work, labeling it a “modern” body and denouncing it as “deformed” or “damaged.” This essay examines the associations of deformity, femininity and modernity raised in the emphatic critical reception to the work. Through an investigation of the roles of the two principals in the sculpture’s production–the artist and the model–and of the critical reception to the work, it argues that this “modern” body proved troublesome to contemporary viewers, not only because it was seen as the likeness of a public celebrity, but also because the figure’s proportions resonated in complex and contradictory ways within contemporary discourses of dance, art, fashion and anthropology. The product of a collaboration between artist and model, the body portrayed in Falguière’s sculpture embodied not simply an individual dancer, but also changes in contemporary conventions governing feminine behavior–changes that were widely perceived as threatening.",,10.1080/24692921.2017.1370258,2469293X,157,National Endowment for the Humanities,,85131623898 (Scopus),24692921,1-2,184,2018-01-01,,https://doi.org/10.1080/24692921.2017.1370258,Feminist Modernist Studies,1

This apparition offered opportunities to address pressing questions in cometary science, including investigating evolutionary and/or heliocentric distance (Rh) effects on volatile production, sampling the hypervolatiles CO and CH4 in an ecliptic comet, and measuring volatile release at small Rh. The faintness and frequently low geocentric velocity of ecliptic comets during most apparitions make our near-infrared observations of these hypervolatiles rare and of high scientific impact. We characterized the volatile composition of 2P/Encke on three post-perihelion dates using the iSHELL spectrograph at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility on Maunakea, HI. We detected fluorescent emission from nine primary volatiles (H2O, CO, C2H6, CH3OH, CH4, H2CO, NH3, OCS, and HCN) and three fragment species (OH∗, NH2, and CN), and obtained a sensitive upper limit for C2H2. We report rotational temperatures, production rates, and mixing ratios (abundances relative to H2O). Compared to mean abundances in comets observed to date in the near-infrared, mixing ratios of trace gases in 2P/Encke were depleted for all species except H2CO and NH3, which were ""normal."" The detection of the hypervolatiles CO and CH4 is particularly notable given the paucity of measurements in ecliptic comets. We observed significant differences in primary volatile composition compared to published pre-perihelion results from 2003 at larger Rh. We discuss possible mechanisms for these differences and discuss these results in the context of findings from the Rosetta mission and ground-based studies of comets.",aae0f7,10.3847/1538-3881/aae0f7,,,,,85071475316 (Scopus),00046256,6,,2018-01-01,,https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-3881/aae0f7,Astronomical Journal,156

However, prior research has been limited by (1) the inability to account for endogenous factors that both funnel families into deprived neighborhoods and increase their likelihood of moving out, and (2) the failure to consider how the spatial distribution of socioeconomic deprivation in the broader community conditions the effect of local deprivation on mobility. This paper attends to this gap in the literature by examining how changes in socioeconomic disadvantage between sending and receiving neighborhoods and the spatial patterning of deprivation in the areas surrounding destination neighborhoods influence future mobility among a representative sample of American adolescents. We employ a modeling strategy that allows us to examine the unique and separable effects of local and extralocal neighborhood disadvantage while simultaneously holding constant time-invariant factors that place some youth at a greater likelihood of experiencing a residential move. We find that moves to more impoverished neighborhoods decrease the likelihood of subsequent mobility and that this effect is most pronounced among respondents who move to neighborhoods surrounded by other similarly deprived neighborhoods. In this sense, geographical pockets of disadvantage strengthen the mobility-hampering effect of neighborhood deprivation on future mobility.",164,10.3390/SOCSCI7090164,20760760,,,,85069767822 (Scopus),,9,,2018-01-01,,https://doi.org/10.3390/SOCSCI7090164,Social Sciences,7

The investigated AHCs have surface areas between 60–937 m2/g and pore volumes between 0.04–1.01 cc/g. Li-diffusion was measured using two complimentary techniques (1) Galvanostatic Intermittent Titration Technique (GITT), and (2) a stretched exponential to investigate the voltage-relaxation (VR) GITT curve. VR-GITT provides two parameters related to (i) the geometry through which the diffusion is occurring, and (ii) a time scale yielding the diffusion constant with knowledge of an appropriate length scale. Both methods find diffusion constants in very good agreement with each other. Most importantly, the VR-GITT fitting parameters serve as a distinctive characterization tool and are able to distinguish between AHCs with different pore geometries and synthesis techniques.

Additionally, drought affects plants in both a species-specific and water-deficit-driven manner, causing the response to drought to be dependent both on how drought is being experienced and on any adaptation to prior drought exposure. Thus, understanding the effect of drought on plants requires assessing drought response in multiple conditions, such as progressive acute drought and recurrent cyclic drought, and at different levels of severity. In this study, we have utilized RNA sequencing to identify changes to the plant transcriptome and the phytobiome during both acute progressive drought and cyclic drought at multiple severities. Co-analysis of the plant and phytobiome, utilizing the same RNAseq data, allows for the identification of novel associations that would not be possible otherwise. We have identified that the drought response ranges from increased transcripts related to photosynthesis and metabolic activity in mild acute drought to decreased transcripts related to photosynthesis and metabolic impairment in severe drought. Moreover, while water deficit is a main driver of transcriptional responses in severe drought, there are increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism and photosynthetic transcripts in cyclic severe drought compared with acute severe drought, independent of water deficit. The phytobiome exhibits alternate responses to drought when compared with the transcriptome. Specifically, the phytobiome is affected more by the cyclic or acute nature of the drought rather than the severity of the drought, with the phytobiome having an increase in taxa under cyclic drought that are often reported to have beneficial effects on the plants. Lastly, we have identified associations between taxa in the phytobiome with expression of disease response, ROS metabolism, and photosynthesis transcripts suggesting interplay between the host plant and its phytobiome in response to drought.",,10.1094/PBIOMES-04-18-0021-R,24712906,249,U.S. Department of Energy,DE-AC05-00OR22725,85065085459 (Scopus),,4,260,2018-01-01,,https://doi.org/10.1094/PBIOMES-04-18-0021-R,Phytobiomes Journal,2

Less than 15% of patients get cured with surgery alone but the addition of chemotherapy to the treatment increases the survival rate of patient by 58%-76%. Surgical resection and aggressive chemotherapy protocols are effective to an extent but have failed to improve the 5-year overall survival rate. Indubitably, new drugs and new therapeutic targets are required to improve the outcome as well as to diminish the long-term toxicities associated with the current benchmark of treatment. STAT3 appears to be an important mediator of chemoresistance in osteosarcoma. Results: Experimental evidence clearly demonstrate the disruption of STAT3 signaling which inhibits the survival and proliferation of osteosarcoma and decreases the growth of disease. This prevailing study approach is by molecular docking, virtual screening to elucidate inhibitor with superior affinity against STAT3 to have a cautious pharma profile. To rectify the best-established drug with high affinity, Mol dock algorithm is executed. The compound Sorafenib (Pub CID 216239) having high-affinity scores is subjected to another similarity search to retrieve the drugs with similar properties. The virtual screened compound with PubChem CID-44815014 as per BOILED-Egg plot reveals its high affinity. Conclusion: Comparative study and ADMET study both showed the compounds to have equivalent properties, whereas interestingly the virtual screened compound having PubChem CID-44815014 is seen to have the lowest rerank score.

Our model system is deprotonated, [lactose-H]-. We computationally characterize the rate-determining barriers to glycosidic bond (C1-Z1 reactions) and cross-ring cleavages, and compare these predictions to our tandem mass spectrometric and infrared spectroscopy data. The glycosidic bond cleavage product data support complex mixtures of anion structures in both the C1 and Z1 anion populations. The specific nature of these distributions is predicted to be directly affected by the nature of the anomeric configuration of the precursor anion and the distribution of energies imparted. i.e., Z1 anions produced from the β-glucose anomeric form have a differing distribution of product ion structures than do those from the α-glucose anomeric form. The most readily formed Z1 anions ([1,4-anhydroglucose-H]- structures) are produced from the β-glucose anomers, and do not ring-open and isomerize as the hemiacetal group is no longer present. In contrast the [3,4-anhydroglucose-H]-, Z1 anion structures, which are most readily produced from α-glucose forms, can ring-open through very low barriers (<25 kJ mol-1) to form energetically and entropically favorable aldehyde isomers assigned with a carbonyl stretch at ∼1640 cm-1. Barriers to interconversion of the pyranose [β-galactose-H]-, C1 anions to ring-open forms were larger, but still modest (≥51 kJ mol-1) consistent with evidence of the presence of both forms in the infrared spectrum. For the cross-ring cleavage 0,2A2 anions, ring-opening at the glucose hemiacetal of [lactose-H]- is rate-limiting (>180 (α-), >197 kJ mol-1 (β-anomers)).

The MSPE contains a narrative description of the applicant’s performance during medical school. In 2002, the Association of American Medical Colleges’ guideline for preparation of the MSPE recommended inclusion of a comparative summative assessment of the student’s overall performance relative to his/her peers (final adjective). Objective: We hypothesize that the inclusion of a final adjective in the MSPE affects a reviewer’s assessment of the applicant’s desirability more than the narrative description of performance and designed a study to evaluate this hypothesis. Design: Fifty-six faculty members from the Departments of Pediatrics and Medicine with experience reviewing MSPEs as part of the intern selection process reviewed two pairs of mock MSPE letters. In each pair, the narrative in one letter was superior to that in the other. Two final adjectives describing relative class ranks were created. Each subject was first presented with a pair of letters with mismatched final adjective (study), i.e., the letter with the stronger narrative was presented with the weaker final adjective and vice versa. The subject was then presented with a second pair of letters without final adjectives (control). Subjects ranked the relative desirability of the two applicants in each pair. Results: The proportion of rankings congruent with the strength of the narratives under study and control conditions were compared. Subjects were significantly less likely to rank the applicants congruent with the strength of the narratives when the strength of the final adjectives conflicted with the strength of the narrative; 42.9% of study letters were ranked congruent with the narrative versus 82.1% of controls (p = 0.0001).

Drawing on the Interaction of Person-Affect-Cognition-Execution model, this study tested a model that sexual sensation seeking (SSS) would impact PIPU through online sexual activities (OSAs) and that this relationship would be influenced by the third-person effect (TPE; a social cognitive bias relating to perceived impacts on others as compared to oneself) in a gender-sensitivemanner. Methods: A total of 808 Chinese college students (age range: 17-22 years, 57.7% male) were recruited and surveyed. Results: Men scored higher than women on OSAs and PIPU and on each scale's component factors. The relationship between SSS and PIPU was mediated by OSAs, and the TPE moderated this relationship: The predictive path (SSS to PIPU) was significant only in participants with high TPE. The moderated mediation model was not invariant across gender groups, with data suggesting that it accounted for a greater proportion of the variance in men as compared with women. Discussion and conclusions: The findings suggest that SSS may operate through participation in OSAs to lead to PIPU, and this relationship is particularly relevant for college-aged males scoring high on the TPE.

Methods: Eighty-eight LTNPs, 53 Progressors, and 323 healthy controls completed annual assessments of cognitive and emotional health as part of a prospective study. The 2 HIV-infected groups and the healthy controls were matched on age and sex distribution at enrollment. Plasma HIV RNA, T-cell counts/percentages, activated monocytes, perivascular monocytes, and markers of macrophage activation (sCD163 and sCD14) were compared by progression subtype. Cognitive and emotional outcomes were compared using cross-sectional linear regression analysis and longitudinal sensitivity models. Results: LTNPs exhibited the same cognitive phenotype and emotional dysregulation as Progressors, with worse outcomes in both groups compared with controls. In addition, cognitive and emotional symptoms were evident before children reached the minimum age for LTNP designation (8 years).

To accomplish this, different theranostic formulations have been evaluated. However, most of them are found to suffer from several limitations extending from poor resolution, radiation damage, to high costs. In order to develop a better theranostic modality, we have designed and synthesized a novel platinum(ii)-based 'aggregation induced emission' (AIE) molecule (named BMPP-Pt) which showed strong intra-cellular fluorescence and also simultaneously exhibited potent cytotoxic activity. Due to this dual functionality, we wanted to explore the possibility of using this compound as a single molecule based theranostic modality. This compound was characterized using elemental analysis, NMR and IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and single crystal X-ray structure determination. BMPP-Pt was found to exhibit a high AIE property with emission maxima at 497 nm. For more efficient cancer cell targeting, BMPP-Pt was encapsulated into mesoporous silica nanoparticles (Pt-MSNPs) and the MSNPs were further surface modified with an anti-EpCAM aptamer (Pt-MSNP-E). Pt-MSNPs exhibited higher intracellular fluorescence compared to free BMPP-Pt, though both of them induced a similar degree of cell death via the apoptosis pathway, possibly via cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. Anti-EpCAM aptamer modification was found to increase both cytotoxicity and intracellular fluorescence compared to unmodified MSNPs.

The increasing risk of SU in young women has been a rising concern, and the needs of young women may be unique. The importance of relationships and ‘‘connectedness’’ as aberrant behavior protective factors has been validated extensively in the literature of several disciplines over the past decade. Less well described are the components and qualities of relational engagement among adolescents involved in SU treatment. This multimethod study was a broad analysis of the nature of relational health in adolescent girls, so as to determine whether understanding components of relational health could inform SU treatment options. The survey tool, the Relational Health Indices (Liang et al., 2002), was used to measure dimensions and domains of relational health in adolescent girls and informed qualitative methods in the study. It is clear from this research that adolescent girls in SU treatment care deeply about but are confused regarding their relationships with others, particularly their romantic partners and their mothers. They have a desire to help others, specifically their siblings and others struggling with addiction.

Such quincunx tight framelets are associated with quincunx tight framelet filter banks {a; b1, b2, b3} having increasing orders of vanishing moments, possessing symmetry property, and enjoying the additional double canonical properties:Moreover, the supports of all the high-pass filters b1, b2, b3 are no larger than that of the low-pass filter a. For a low-pass filter a which is not a quincunx orthogonal wavelet filter, we show that a quincunx tight framelet filter bank {a; b1, . . ., bL} with b1 taking the above canonical form must have L ≥ 3 highpass filters. Thus, our family of double canonical quincunx tight framelets with symmetry property has the minimum number of generators. Numerical calculation indicates that this family of double canonical quincunx tight framelets with symmetry property can be arbitrarily smooth. Using one-dimensional filters having linear-phase moments, in this paper we also provide a second approach to construct multiple canonical quincunx tight framelets with symmetry property. In particular, the second approach yields a family of 6-multiple canonical real-valued quincunx tight framelets in L2(ℝ2) and a family of double canonical complex-valued quincunx tight framelets in L2(ℝ2) such that both of them have symmetry property and arbitrarily increasing orders of smoothness and vanishing moments.

Consequently, a final diagnosis is sometimes delayed by months and years of follow-up. Early treatment for multiple sclerosis is recommended to reduce long-term disability. Therefore, we intend to explore neuroimaging biomarkers that can reliably distinguish between the two diagnoses. Methods We reviewed prospectively collected clinical, standard MRI and diffusion tensor imaging data from 12 pediatric patients who presented with acute demyelination with and without encephalopathy. Patients were followed for an average of 6.5 years to determine the accuracy of final diagnosis. Final diagnosis was determined using 2013 International Pediatric MS Study Group criteria. Control subjects consisted of four age-matched healthy individuals for each patient. Results The study population consisted of six patients with central nervous system demyelination with encephalopathy with a presumed diagnosis of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and six without encephalopathy with a presumed diagnosis of multiple sclerosis or clinically isolated syndrome at high risk for multiple sclerosis. During follow-up, two patients with initial diagnosis of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis were later diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Diffusion tensor imaging region of interest analysis of baseline scans showed differences between final diagnosis of multiple sclerosis and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis patients, whereby low fractional anisotropy and high radial diffusivity occurred in multiple sclerosis patients compared with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis patients and the age-matched controls.

Methods: Data were drawn from annual interviews conducted with an urban sample of girls and their primary caregivers from ages 5–8 (baseline) through age 17 (n = 2068, 57.7% Black, 42.3% White). Cox proportional hazards regression analyses using race and childhood trauma to predict alcohol use initiation were conducted in two stages, with SES and neighborhood factors added in the second stage. Results: Childhood trauma was more prevalent (29.0 vs. 17.5%) and alcohol use initiation less prevalent (37.7 vs. 54.4%) in Black vs. White girls, but we found no evidence for differences in liability conferred by trauma. However, significant changes in hazards ratios (HRs) from the unadjusted to adjusted models were observed for Black race (HR = 0.57, CI 0.50–0.65 to HR = 0.66, CI 0.54–0.80) and childhood trauma (HR = 1.70, CI 1.46–1.99 to HR = 1.34, CI 1.05–1.71). Conclusions: Findings indicate that childhood trauma is an equally potent risk factor for early drinking onset for Black and White girls; the risk for early alcohol use in Black girls who have experienced traumatic events should not be underestimated.

Understanding how pulses of deadwood impact the climate system requires understanding which factors influence greenhouse gas production during wood decay. Recent analyses identify stem diameter as an important control, but report effects that vary in magnitude and direction. This complexity may reflect interacting effects of soil contact, geometry and variable tissue properties. To dissect these effects, we implemented a three-way factorial experiment in Fraxinus americana, (white ash), an iconic North American species threatened by an invasive beetle. Soil contact accelerated decay rates by an order of magnitude with an effect that varied with stem diameter, not bark presence. After experimentally controlling surface area-to-volume ratio, half-buried wide stems decayed more slowly than half-buried narrow stems but more quickly than the aggregate decay rate of buried and suspended stems. These results closely matched variation in moisture content within and among samples, suggesting that limited vertical conduction of soil moisture through deadwood mediates the effect of stem diameter on wood decay. Soil contact also influenced greenhouse gas concentrations reinforcing recent evidence that deadwood acts as a source for CO2 and CH4 while acting as a sink for N2O. Our results suggest that managing tree species affected by pest outbreaks, including F. americana, for biomass salvage and greenhouse gas mitigation requires understanding traits that mediate wood permeability and diffusivity to soil moisture and greenhouse gases.",,10.1007/s10021-017-0136-x,14350629,85,National Science Foundation,DEB 1302797,85016630823 (Scopus),14329840,1,97,2018-01-01,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10021-017-0136-x,Ecosystems,21

In an attempt to achieve this we collaborated with local community members to develop and implement a contextualized science curriculum at a school in the aforementioned setting. As soon as the project was launched it became increasingly clear that although the ideology of ‘empowerment through science education’ seemed a promising venture, it could also be an extremely complex and often frustrating undertaking. This was especially true when working within an unfamiliar cultural setting. Numerous challenges, such as the lack of teacher motivation, malnutrition amongst the learners, and conflicts stemming from differences between the indigenous knowledge and the western concept of science, greatly impeded the delivery of quality education in the area.

An additional goal was to determine whether soft toric or LRGP contact lenses performed better objectively in the correction of astigmatism and to determine which modality is preferred by subjects. Methods: This was a multisite prospective cross-over clinical study. Ten asymptomatic contact lens wearers per site (four university clinics) were recruited and randomly assigned to group A or group B.

We sampled three resident mosquito species (Aedes taeniorhynchus, Culex quinquefasciatus, and Aedes aegypti) using CDC light and gravid traps on three islands in 2012, 2013, and 2014. We sampled along altitudinal gradients to ask whether there are mosquito-free refugia at higher elevations as there are in Hawaii. We captured both Ae. taeniorhynchus and Cx. quinquefasciatus at all sites. However, abundances differed across islands and years and declined significantly with elevation. Aedes aegypti were scarce and limited to areas of human inhabitation.

We report water production rates, as well as production rates and abundance ratios relative to H2O, for eight trace parent molecules (native ices), CO, CH4, H2CO, CH3OH, HCN, NH3, C2H2, and C2H6, on 2 days spanning UT 2017 January 6/7 and 7/8, shortly following perihelion. Trace species were measured simultaneously with H2O and/or OH prompt emission, a proxy for H2O production, thereby providing a robust and consistent means of establishing the native ice composition of 45P. Its favorable geocentric radial velocity (approximately -35 km s-1) permitted sensitive measures of the ""hypervolatiles"" CO and CH4, which are substantially undercharacterized in JFCs. Our results represent the most precise ground-based measures of CO and CH4 to date in a JFC, providing a foundation for building meaningful statistics regarding their abundances. The abundance ratio for CH4 in 45P (0.79% - 0.06% relative to H2O) was consistent with its median value as measured among Oort Cloud comets, whereas CO (0.60% - 0.04%) was strongly depleted. Compared with all measured comets, HCN (0.049% - 0.012%) was strongly depleted, CH3OH (3.6% - 0.3%) was enriched, and the remaining species were consistent with their respective median abundances.

Such different patterns of floral organ initiation might be linked with different morphologies of floral zygomorphy that have evolved in Asteridae. Here, we provide the first study of zygomorphy in pentapetalous angiosperms placed in a phylogenetic framework, the goal being to find if the different patterns of floral organ initiation are connected with particular patterns of zygomorphy. METHODS: We analyzed patterns of floral organ initiation and displays of zygomorphy, extracted from floral diagrams representing 405 taxa in 330 genera, covering 83% of orders (30 out of 36) and 37% of families (116 out of 313) in core eudicots in the context of a phylogeny using ancestral state reconstructions. KEY RESULTS: The MAB petal initiation is the ancestral state of the pattern of floral organ initiation in pentapetalous angiosperms. Taxa with MAD petal initiation represent ~30 independent origins from the ancestral MAB initiation. There are distinct developmental processes that give rise to zygomorphy in different lineages of pentapetalous angiosperms, closely related lineages being likely to share similar developmental processes. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that development indeed constrains the processes that give rise to floral zygomorphy, while phylogenetic distance allows relaxation of these constraints, which provides novel insights on the role that development plays in the evolution of floral zygomorphy.",,10.3732/ajb.1700229,,1846,National Science Foundation,DEB-1355109,85038814720 (Scopus),00029122,12,1856,2017-12-01,29247025.0,https://doi.org/10.3732/ajb.1700229,American Journal of Botany,104

While monomeric Aβ appears to be benign, oligomers adopt a biologically detrimental structure. These soluble structures can be detected in AD brain tissue by antibodies that demonstrate selectivity for aggregated Aβ. Protofibrils are a subset of soluble oligomeric Aβ species and are described as small (< 100 nm) curvilinear assemblies enriched in β-sheet structure. Our own in vitro studies demonstrate that microglial cells are much more sensitive to soluble Aβ42 protofibrils compared to Aβ42 monomer or insoluble Aβ42 fibrils. Protofibrils interact with microglia, trigger Toll-like receptor signaling, elicit cytokine transcription and expression, and are rapidly taken up by the cells. Because of the importance of this Aβ species, we sought to develop an antibody that selectively recognizes protofibrils over other Aβ species. Immunization of rabbits with isolated Aβ42 protofibrils generated a high-titer anti serum with a strong affinity for Aβ42 protofibrils. The antiserum, termed AbSL, was selective for Aβ42 protofibrils over Aβ42 monomers and Aβ42 fibrils. AbSL did not react with amyloid precursor protein and recognized distinct pathological features in AD transgenic mouse brain slices. Competition studies with an Aβ antibody that targets residues 1–16 indicated that the conformational epitope for AbSL involved the N-terminal region of protofibrils in some manner. The newly developed antibody may have potential diagnostic and therapeutic uses in AD tissue and patients, and targeting of protofibrils in AD may have beneficial effects.

Despite all the advantages that this unicellular alga offers, poor and inconsistent expression of nuclear transgenes remains an obstacle for basic and applied research. We used a data-mining strategy to identify highly expressed genes in Chlamydomonas whose flanking sequences were tested for the ability to drive heterologous nuclear transgene expression. Candidates identified in this search included two ribosomal protein genes, RPL35a and RPL23, and ferredoxin, FDX1, whose flanking regions including promoters, terminators and untranslated sequences could drive stable luciferase transgene expression to significantly higher levels than the commonly used Hsp70A-RBCS2 (AR) hybrid promoter/terminator sequences. The RPL23 flanking sequences were further tested using the zeocin resistance gene sh-ble as a reporter in monocistronic and dicistronic constructs, and consistently yielded higher numbers of zeocin-resistant transformants and higher levels of resistance than AR- or PSAD-based vectors. Chlamydomonas RPL23 sequences also enabled transgene expression in Volvox carteri.

We analyzed blood samples from 363 birds caught near Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, for the presence of haemosporidian infections. We characterized parasite lineages by determining nucleotide variation of the parasite's mitochondrial cyt b gene. Fifty-nine individuals were infected, and we identified 7 lineages of haemosporidian parasites. Fifty individuals were infected by 6 Haemoproteus sp. lineages, including a newly characterized lineage of Haem. (Parahaemoproteus) sp. CUH01. Nine individuals carried the P. relictum lineage GRW4, including 5 endemic Cuban Grassquits (Tiaris canorus) and 1 migratory Cape May Warbler (Setophaga tigrina). A sequence of the merozoite surface protein gene from one Cuban Grassquit infected with GRW4 matched that of the Hawaiian haplotype Pr9. Our results indicate that resident and migratory Cuban birds are infected with a malaria lineage that has severely affected populations of several endemic Hawaiian birds. We suggest GRW4 may be associated with the lack of several bird species on Cuba that are ubiquitous elsewhere in the West Indies.

We examined the drivers of group reproductive output in callitrichids by 1) conducting a meta-analysis of published studies of callitrichid group composition; 2) assigning developmental class based on reproductive morphology; and 3) using multivariate modeling to test whether the proportion of individuals of each developmental class predicts the presence and the number of surviving offspring among free-ranging Weddell’s saddleback tamarins (Leontocebus weddelli) and emperor tamarins (Saguinus imperator) in Peru. The meta-analysis revealed that the number of adult females and group size, but not the number of adult males, are significantly correlated with group reproductive output. Statistical models of the new dataset revealed that the proportion of primary breeding males, primary breeding females, and group size predicted whether groups had surviving infants, and that only the proportion of primary breeding females and group size predicted the number of surviving infants.

Despite the attractiveness and ecological importance of many Heliconia, the genus has been the subject of limited molecular phylogenetic studies. We sample seven markers from the plastid and nuclear genomes for 202 samples of Heliconia. This represents ca. 75% of accepted species and includes coverage of all taxonomic subgenera and sections. We date this phylogeny using fossils associated with other families in the Zingiberales; in particular we review and evaluate the Eocene fossil Ensete oregonense. We use this dated phylogenetic framework to evaluate the evolution of two components of flower orientation that are hypothesized to be important for modulating pollinator discrimination and pollen placement: resupination and erect versus pendant inflorescence habit. Our phylogenetic results suggest that the monophyletic Melanesian subgenus Heliconiopsis and a small clade of Ecuadorian species are together the sister group to the rest of Heliconia. Extant diversity of Heliconia originated in the Late Eocene (39 Ma) with rapid diversification through the Early Miocene, making it the oldest known clade of hummingbird-pollinated plants. Most described subgenera and sections are not monophyletic, though closely related groups of species, often defined by shared geography, mirror earlier morphological cladistic analyses. Evaluation of changes in resupination and inflorescence habit suggests that these characters are more homoplasious than expected, and this largely explains the non-monophyly of previously circumscribed subgenera, which were based on these characters. We also find strong evidence for the correlated evolution of resupination and inflorescence habit. The correlated model suggests that the most recent common ancestor of all extant Heliconia had resupinate flowers and erect inflorescences. Finally, we note our nearly complete species sampling and dated phylogeny allow for an assessment of taxonomic history in terms of phylogenetic diversity. We find approximately half of the currently recognized species, corresponding to half of the phylogenetic diversity, have been described since 1975, highlighting the continued importance of basic taxonomic research and conservation initiatives to preserve both described and undiscovered species of Heliconia.",,10.1016/j.ympev.2016.12.001,10959513,150,National Institute of General Medical Sciences,P20GM103449,85009188339 (Scopus),10557903,,167,2017-12-01,27998817.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2016.12.001,Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution,117

By comparison, the 64Cu radionuclide has a half-life of 12.7 h, which is ideal for administering and imaging purposes. In spite of appreciable research efforts, high-affinity copper chelators suitable for brain imaging applications are still lacking. Herein, we present the synthesis and characterization of a series of bifunctional compounds (BFCs) based on macrocyclic 1,4,7-triazacyclononane and 2,11-diaza[3.3](2,6)pyridinophane ligand frameworks that exhibit a high affinity for Cu2+ ions. In addition, these BFCs contain a 2-phenylbenzothiazole fragment that is known to interact tightly with amyloid β fibrillar aggregates. Determination of the protonation constants (pKa values) and stability constants (log β values) of these BFCs, as well as characterization of the isolated copper complexes using X-ray crystallography, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and electrochemical studies, suggests that these BFCs exhibit desirable properties for the development of novel 64Cu PET imaging agents for Alzheimer's disease.",,10.1021/acs.inorgchem.7b01883,1520510X,13801,National Institutes of Health,NIRG 12-259199,85034582947 (Scopus),00201669,22,13814,2017-11-20,29112419.0,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.7b01883,Inorganic Chemistry,56

Due to the paucity of data on supplement use, this study aimed to determine the proportion of Ugandan athletes using nutritional supplements and to investigate the athletes' motivation to use these supplements. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in which an interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data from 359 professional athletes participating in individual (boxing, cycling, athletics) and team (basketball, rugby, football, netball, and volleyball) sports. The data were categorized, and a Chi-square test was used for statistical analysis. Results: Of the 359 athletes, 48 (13.4%) used nutritional supplements. Carbohydrate supplements, energy drinks, vitamin and mineral supplements, fish oils, and protein supplements were the most common supplements used by athletes. NS use was significantly more common among athletes who played rugby and basketball (X  2  = 61.101, p < 0.0001), athletes who had played the sport for 5-10 years (X  2  = 7.460, p = 0.024), and athletes who had attained a tertiary education (X  2  = 33.377, p < 0.0001).

Ontogenic studies suggested the evolution of floral zygomorphy in these two whorls is independent. Here, we have examined the evolution of floral symmetry in the androecium and corolla in Solanaceae. The character states of floral symmetry were assembled for androecium and corolla separately, and ancestral state reconstructions were carried out at both the genus and species levels for Solanaceae and its outgroups. Correlation tests were performed to determine whether the presence of floral zygomorphy in the androecium and corolla is correlated. The ancestral state reconstructions suggest the flower of the most recent common ancestor of Solanaceae is likely zygomorphic in the androecium but actinomorphic in the corolla. Multiple losses and gains of floral zygomorphy in androecium and corolla explain the existing pattern of floral symmetry in Solanaceae.

The current study examined regional variation in QOL outcomes in a large multinational sample of patients with a Fontan relative to patients with atrial septal defects (ASDs) and ventricular septal defects (VSDs). Methods From the Assessment of Patterns of Patient-Reported Outcomes in Adults with Congenital Heart disease—International Study (APPROACH-IS), 405 patients (163 Fontan and 242 ASD/VSD) across Asia, Europe, and North America provided consent for access to their medical records and completed a survey evaluating QOL (0 to 100 linear analog scale). Primary CHD diagnosis, disease complexity, surgical history, and documented history of mood and anxiety disorders were recorded. Differences in QOL, medical complications, and mood and anxiety disorders between Fontan and ASD/VSD patients, and across geographic regions, were examined using analysis of covariance. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to identify variables associated with the QOL ratings. Results Patients with a Fontan reported significantly lower QOL, and greater medical complications and mood and anxiety disorders relative to patients with ASD/VSD. Inpatient cardiac admissions, mood disorders, and anxiety disorders were associated with lower QOL among patients with a Fontan, and mood disorders were associated with lower QOL among patients with ASD/VSD. Regional differences for QOL were not observed in patients with a Fontan; however, significant differences were identified in patients with ASD/VSD. Conclusions Regional variation of QOL is commonplace in adults with CHD; however, it appears affected by greater disease burden. Among patients with a Fontan, regional variation of QOL is lost.

Design and Methods: A systematic literature review of publications identified through a comprehensive search of five relevant databases (PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature [CINAHL], Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science) was conducted using a modified Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) approach in January 2017 to describe major themes and associated factors of the impact of CCRWDs on population health. Findings: Three major themes emerged: environmental disruption resulting in exposure to toxins, population susceptibility, and health systems infrastructure (failure to plan-prepare-mitigate, inadequate response, and lack of infrastructure). Direct health impact was characterized by four major categories: weather-related morbidity and mortality, waterborne diseases/water-related illness, vector-borne and zoonotic diseases, and psychiatric/mental health effects. Scope and duration of the event are factors that exacerbate the impact of CCRWDs. Discussion of specific factors amenable to mitigation was limited. Flooding as an event was overrepresented in this analysis (60%), and the majority of the research reviewed was conducted in high-income or upper middle-/high-income countries (62%), despite the fact that low-income countries bear a disproportionate share of the burden on morbidity and mortality from CCRWDs. Conclusions: Empirical evidence related to CCRWDs is predominately descriptive in nature, characterizing the cascade of climatic shifts leading to major environmental disruption and exposure to toxins, and their resultant morbidity and mortality. There is inadequate representation of research exploring potentially modifiable factors associated with CCRWDs and their impact on population health. This review lays the foundation for a wide array of further areas of analysis to explore the negative health impacts of CCRWDs and for nurses to take a leadership role in identifying and advocating for evidence-based policies to plan, prevent, or mitigate these effects. Clinical Relevance: Nurses comprise the largest global healthcare workforce and are in a position to advocate for disaster preparedness for CCRWDs, develop more robust environmental health policies, and work towards mitigating exposure to environmental toxins that may threaten human health.",,10.1111/jnu.12328,15475069,625,,,85027491177 (Scopus),15276546,6,634,2017-11-01,28834176.0,https://doi.org/10.1111/jnu.12328,Journal of Nursing Scholarship,49

The goals of this study were to estimate the association of persistent AUD, non-abstinent remission and abstinent remission (‘AUD/remission status’) in a proband with AUD/remission status in a relative and to test whether this association differed in related and unrelated proband-relative pairs. Design: High-risk family study of alcohol dependence. Probands were recruited from treatment settings and relatives were invited to participate. Baseline assessments occurred between 1991 and 1998 with follow-up between 1996 and 2005. Half of probands were matched with a biological 1st-degree relative with life-time AUD (related group) and half of probands were paired with an unrelated individual with life-time AUD (unrelated group). Setting: Brooklyn, New York; Indianapolis, Indiana; Iowa City, Iowa; San Diego, California; Farmington, Connecticut; and St Louis, Missouri, USA. Participants: A total of 606 probands (25.7% female, mean age 37.7) with baseline and follow-up data and 606 of their 1st-degree relatives who had life-ime AUDs (45.8% female, mean age 36.2 years). Measurements: Persistent AUD, non-abstinent remission and abstinent remission were based on self-report interview data on most recent AUD symptoms and alcohol consumption. Dependent variable was relatives’ AUD/remission status. Independent variable was probands’ AUD/remission status. Findings: A total of 34.6% of probands and 20.6% of relatives were abstinent and 11.1% of probands and 22.8% of relatives were in non-abstinent remission. AUD/remission status was correlated significantly in related (r = 0.23, P = 0.0037) but not in unrelated pairs. A significant interaction of probands’ abstinent remission with a variable representing related (versus unrelated, P = 0.003) pairs suggested a familial association for abstinent remission. In related pairs, individuals with an abstinent proband were more likely to be abstinent themselves than were individuals whose proband had persistent AUD [relative risk ratio = 3.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.56–6.85, P = 0.002]; this association was not significant in unrelated pairs.

The effect on root structure and growth depends both on the hydraphile spacer chain length and lariat ether side chain length as well as the concentration of compound in the growth medium. In some cases a correlation to ion transport activity was apparent, but such a correlation is not always manifested. Surprisingly, planar bilayer conductance (BLM) studies showed that lariat ethers and lariat ether amides both exhibited well controlled membrane activity. Pore formation in soybean asolectin membranes occurred readily and the pores were stable and sustained. Low concentrations of active hydraphiles and lariat ethers altered the primary:lateral root density ratio, generally increasing it. The transporter-mediated alterations in lateral root density were suggestive of the activity of plant auxins such as indole-3-acetic acid and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, which are known to depend on cytosolic potassium ion concentrations. The hypothesis that the compounds interfere with the auxin pathway was tested and discounted by using auxin-resistant A. thaliana mutants.

Measures of species diversity that do not incorporate the ages of lineages disregard the evolutionary distinctiveness of species. In contrast, phylogenetic diversity integrates both the number of species and their history of evolutionary diversification. Here we compared species diversity and phylogenetic diversity in a large number of flowering plant (angiosperm) floras distributed across EAS and ENA, two regions with similar contemporary environments and broadly shared floristic history. After accounting for climate and sample area, we found both species diversity and phylogenetic diversity to be significantly higher in EAS than in ENA. When we controlled the number of species statistically, we found that phylogenetic diversity remained substantially higher in EAS than in ENA, although it tended to converge at high latitude. This pattern held independently for herbs, shrubs, and trees. The anomaly in species and phylogenetic diversity likely resulted from differences in regional processes, related in part to high climatic and topographic heterogeneity, and a strong monsoon climate, in EAS.

To evaluate multi-decadal performance of an old-growth TRF at the La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica, we established 18 0.5-ha annually-censused forest inventory plots in a stratified-random design across major landscape edaphic gradients. Over the 17-year study period, there were moderate differences in stand dynamics and structure across these gradients but no detectable difference in woody productivity. We found large effects on forest structure and dynamics from the mega-Niño event at the outset of the study, with subdecadal recovery and subsequent stabilization.

While there were annual to multiannual variations in the structure and dynamics, particularly in relation to local disturbances and the mega-Niño event, at the longer temporal scale and broader spatial scale this landscape was remarkably stable. This stability contrasts notably with a current hypothesis of increasing biomass and dynamics of TRF, which we term the Bigger and Faster Hypothesis (B&FHo).

This pattern may reflect transient contextual factors, including the degree of effort exerted by individuals undergoing cognitive testing. The present study examined whether effort corresponds to the expression of persistent HIV-related cognitive impairment among individuals receiving combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). HIV+ individuals (n = 111) averaged 48.2 (14.9) years of age and 13.0 (2.7) years of education and HIV− individuals (n = 92) averaged 34.9 (17.2) years of age and 13.5 (1.9) years of education. Participants completed a neuropsychological battery and a clinically validated measure of effort (Test of Memory Malingering, trial 1). Results revealed that the vast majority of HIV+ (85%) and HIV− (89%) individuals performed above published guidelines for adequate effort. Furthermore, the expression of cognitive impairment in HIV was not related to effort performance. The results were unchanged when examining HIV+ individuals with and without viral suppression. Finally, disability and disability-seeking status, and a proxy measure of apathy did not correspond to effort levels in HIV+ individuals. These findings suggest that variability in the expression of cognitive impairment in the cART era is unlikely to represent overt effort failures or other confounds unrelated to the disease.

Cortical microtubules are connected with the plasma membrane (PM); however, how the membrane affects cortical microtubule organization is not well understood. Here, we showed that phospholipase Dδ (PLDδ) was associated with the PM and co-localized with microtubules in cells. In vitro analysis revealed that PLDδ bound to microtubules, resulting in microtubule disorganization. Site-specific mutations that decreased PLDδ enzymatic activity impaired its effects on destabilizing microtubule organization. Heat shock transiently activated PLDδ, without any change of its PM localization, triggering microtubule dissociation from PM and depolymerization and seedling death in Arabidopsis, but these effects were alleviated in pldδ knockout mutants. Complementation of pldδ with wild-type PLDδ, but not mutated PLDδ, restored the phenotypes of microtubules and seedling survival to those of wild-type Arabidopsis. Thus, we conclude that the PM-associated PLDδ negatively regulates plant thermotolerance via destabilizing cortical microtubules, in an activity-dependent manner, rather than its subcellular translocation.",,10.1111/pce.13023,13653040,2220,National Natural Science Foundation of China,2012CB114200,85028045564 (Scopus),01407791,10,2235,2017-10-01,28710795.0,https://doi.org/10.1111/pce.13023,Plant Cell and Environment,40

College-aged students with type 1 diabetes struggle to self-manage their condition. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), if controlled within acceptable limits (6–8%), is associated with the prevention or delay of serious diabetic complications such as kidney and cardiovascular disease. Diabetes educators provide knowledge and skills, but young adults must self-manage their condition on a daily basis, independent of parents. The Hage framework includes five tasks of theory construction: narrowing and naming the concepts, specifying the definitions, creating the theoretical statements, specifying the linkages, and ordering components in preparation for model building. During the process, concepts within the theory were revised as the literature was reviewed, and measures and hypotheses, foundational to research, were generated. We were successful in applying the framework and creating a model of factors affecting glycemic control, emphasizing that physical activity, thought of as a normal part of wellness, can be a two-edged sword producing positive effect but also serious negative effects in some college-aged students with type 1 diabetes. Contextual factors important to self-management in college-aged students are emphasized.

The study explores associations between demographic and clinical variables and PAT volume, using multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) scanning in China. We also examined the relationship between PAT volume and coronary artery disease (CAD). Methods An observational, correlational study design was used. Chinese (n = 163) attended a study visit and underwent MDCT scanning between September 2014 and December 2015. Results Participants were 48.5% male and had a mean age of 60.6 (SD 9.4) years. PAT volume was higher (p = 0.001) in males than in females. PAT volume was correlated with age (r = 0.388, p = 0.001), systolic blood pressure (r = 0.205, p = 0.009), body mass index (r = 0.466, p = 0.001), high-density cholesterol (r = − 0.282, p = 0.001), low-density cholesterol (r = 0.177, p = 0.024), and triglycerides (r = 0.248, p = 0.001).

Since deep learning was introduced to the field of bioinformatics in 2012, it has achieved success in a number of areas such as protein residue-residue contact prediction, secondary structure prediction, and fold recognition. In this work, we developed deep learning methods to improve the prediction of torsion (dihedral) angles of proteins. Results: We design four different deep learning architectures to predict protein torsion angles. The architectures including deep neural network (DNN) and deep restricted Boltzmann machine (DRBN), deep recurrent neural network (DRNN) and deep recurrent restricted Boltzmann machine (DReRBM) since the protein torsion angle prediction is a sequence related problem. In addition to existing protein features, two new features (predicted residue contact number and the error distribution of torsion angles extracted from sequence fragments) are used as input to each of the four deep learning architectures to predict phi and psi angles of protein backbone. The mean absolute error (MAE) of phi and psi angles predicted by DRNN, DReRBM, DRBM and DNN is about 20-21° and 29-30° on an independent dataset. The MAE of phi angle is comparable to the existing methods, but the MAE of psi angle is 29°, 2° lower than the existing methods. On the latest CASP12 targets, our methods also achieved the performance better than or comparable to a state-of-the art method.

Most of all-optical-spin-reversal ferromagnets are found to have a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), but it has been unknown whether PMA is necessary for spin reversal. Here we theoretically investigate magnetic thin films with either PMA or in-plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA). Our results show that spin reversal in IMA systems is possible, but only with a longer laser pulse and within a narrow laser parameter region. Spin reversal does not show a strong helicity dependence where the left- and right-circularly polarized light lead to the identical results. By contrast, the spin reversal in PMA systems is robust, provided both the spin angular momentum and laser field are strong enough while the magnetic anisotropy itself is not too strong. This explains why experimentally the majority of all-optical spin-reversal samples are found to have strong PMA and why spins in Fe nanoparticles only cant out of plane. It is the laser-induced spin-orbit torque that plays a key role in the spin reversal. Surprisingly, the same spin-orbit torque results in laser-induced spin rectification in spin-mixed configuration, a prediction that can be tested experimentally.

Objectives: To identify the midlife consequences of heavy adolescent marijuana use and the mechanisms driving effects among a Black, urban population. Methods: This study analyzed the propensity score-matched prospective data from the Woodlawn Study, a community cohort study of urban Black youth followed from ages 6–42. After matching the 165 adolescents who used marijuana heavily to 165 non-heavy/nonusers on background confounders to reduce selection effects (64.5% male), we tested the association of heavy marijuana use by age 16 with social, economic, and physical and psychological health outcomes in midlife and the ability of adult drug trajectories (marijuana, cocaine, and heroin use from ages 17–42) and school dropout to mediate effects. Results: Heavy adolescent marijuana use was associated with an increased risk of being poor and of being unmarried in midlife. Marijuana use also predicted lower income and greater anxious mood in midlife. Both adult drug use trajectories and school dropout significantly mediated socioeconomic effects but not marital or anxious mood outcomes.

Although personal resources and networks are important factors in understanding whether older people volunteer and provide family care, studies of the psychological factors influencing these behaviors are rare. Using theoretical guidance of the resource and strategic mobilization model, this study aims to construct a psychological factor-sense of benevolence (SBEN)- and elucidate the effects of SBEN on volunteering and caregiving among older adults when personal resources and networks are controlled. Authors, using data from the 2000 Health and Retirement Study, included 939 community-dwelling older adults age 55 years and older in the study. Using principal component analysis, authors retained 10 items to construct the SBEN scale (Cronbach's alpha =.86). Two separate logistic regression models were used to assess the relationships between SBEN and volunteering and SBEN and caregiving.

Chronic plasmodium brasilianum infections in wild peruvian tamarins,OA,Gold OA,-,-,Green Final OA,Green Accepted OA,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0184504,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85029450028,,"There is an increased interest in potential zoonotic malarias. To date, Plasmodium malariae that infects humans remains indistinguishable from Plasmodium brasilianum, which is widespread among New World primates. Distributed throughout tropical Central and South America, the Callitrichidae are small arboreal primates in which detection of natural Plasmodium infection has been extremely rare. Most prior screening efforts have been limited to small samples, the use of low-probability detection methods, or both. Rarely have screening efforts implemented a longitudinal sampling design. Through an annual mark-recapture program of two sympatric callitrichids, the emperor (Saguinus imperator) and saddleback (Saguinus fuscicollis) tamarins, whole blood samples were screened for Plasmodium by microscopy and nested PCR of the cytochrome b gene across four consecutive years (2012–2015). Following the first field season, approximately 50% of the samples collected each subsequent year were from recaptured individuals. In particular, out of 245 samples from 129 individuals, 11 samples from 6 individuals were positive for Plasmodium, and all but one of these infections was found in S. imperator. Importantly, the cytochrome b sequences were 100% identical to former isolates of P. malariae from humans and P. brasilianum from Saimiri sp. Chronic infections were detected as evidenced by repeated infections (7) from two individuals across the 4-year study period. Furthermore, 4 of the 5 infected emperor tamarins were part of a single group spanning the entire study period. Overall, the low prevalence reported here is consistent with previous findings. This study identifies two new natural hosts for P. brasilianum and provides evidence in support of chronic infections in wildlife populations. Given that callitrichids are often found in mixed-species associations with other primates and can be resilient to human-disturbed environments, they could contribute to the maintenance of P. malariae populations if future work provides entomological and epidemiological evidence indicating human zoonotic infections.",e0184504,10.1371/journal.pone.0184504,19326203,,Amazon Conservation Association,,85029450028 (Scopus),,9,,2017-09-01,28902879.0,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0184504,PLoS ONE,12

We also used non-metric multi-dimensional scaling and Mantel tests to determine whether the similarity of cockroach assemblages could be explained by different landscape categories (savanna, forests and flood zones) or by geographic distance. We identified a single model that best predict observed variation in cockroach abundance and species richness. Differences in assemblage similarity were largely due to differences in the savanna–forest habitat axis. Geographic distance was also found to effect assemblage similarity.

Phylogenetic patterns in these attributes provide insight into the extent to which rarity and extinction risk are conserved during evolution and the potential for species-level heritability. We evaluated phylogenetic signal (i.e., related species resembling each other more than species drawn at random) and evolutionary conservatism (similarity among related species exceeding that expected from a Brownian model of evolution) in three axes of rarity (local abundance, geographical range size and habitat breadth) among species in a regional pool of tropical woody plants. Location: The Madidi region in Bolivia. Time period: 2001–2010. Major taxa studied: Lignophyta clade. Methods: We used a network of 48 1-ha forest plots and 442 0.1-ha forest plots to measure local abundance and habitat breadth of 1,700+ woody plant species (from 100+ plant families). We estimated geographical range size from occurrence records of individual species across the Neotropics. We characterized overall phylogenetic patterns of rarity using Blomberg's K and applied variance partitioning among taxonomic levels, as well as disparity analysis, to describe patterns of trait distribution at different depths in the phylogeny. Results: We found phylogenetic signal, but not evolutionary conservatism, in the three axes of rarity. The variance in rarity among supra-specific taxa, particularly families and genera, exceeded that calculated from random draws of species from the Madidi region. Phylogenetic signal, estimated by the proportion of variance among supra-specific taxonomic levels, varied between 23 and 36% for local abundance and geographical range size, and between 9 and 10% for habitat breadth.

However, attempts to explain this behavior on the basis of actual quantum physics going on at the atomic or molecular level within some element of brain or neuronal anatomy (other than the ordinary quantum physics that underlies everything), do not seem to survive much scrutiny. Moreover, it has been found empirically that the usual physics-like Hilbert space model seems not to apply in detail to human cognition in the large. In this paper we lay the groundwork for a theory that might explain the provenance of quantum-like behavior in complex systems whose internal structure is essentially hidden or inaccessible. The approach is via the logic obeyed by these systems which is similar to, but not identical with, the logic obeyed by actual quantum systems.

We tested the effects of artificial nectar feeders in an Ecuadorian cloud forest on four aspects of bat–plant interactions: (1) bat relative abundance; (2) bat pollen loads; (3) flower visitation rates, and (4) breeding success of a bat-pollinated species (Burmeistera glabrata). We divided the study site into areas close to (~30 m) and far from (~500 m) three different feeder sites. At each distance, we captured nectar bats (Anoura caudifer, Anoura cultrata, and Lonchophylla robusta) to estimate their relative abundance and to collect pollen from fur and fecal samples. We also videotaped flowers to estimate bat visitation rates and recorded different breeding success variables of B. glabrata. We found that areas close to feeders have higher relative bat abundance by a factor of 40. In spite of this, the presence of feeders did not affect bat pollen loads, nor the flower visitation rates and breeding success of B. glabrata.

The continuous wavelet transform (CWT)-based SST sharpens the time-frequency representation of a non-stationary signal by assigning the scale variable of the signal's CWT to the frequency variable by a reference IF function. Since the SST method is applied to estimate the IFs of all frequency components of a signal based on one single reference IF function, it may yield not very accurate results.

(2) Do the same places consistently rank among those with the highest crime counts? (3) How much crime concentration would be observed if crimes were distributed randomly over place? (4) To what degree does the spatial concentration of crime depend on places that are crime free? Methods: The data are annual counts of violent and property crimes in St. Louis between 2000 and 2014. Temporal stability in the spatial inequality of crime is measured by computing the fraction of crimes that occur in the 5% of street segments with the highest crime frequencies each year. The spatial mobility of crime is measured by computing the number of years each street segment appears in the top 5% of street segments. Poisson simulations are used to estimate the fraction of crimes that could appear in the top 5% of street segments on the basis of chance alone. The impact of crime-free locales on the spatial concentration of crime is evaluated by comparing results from analyses that include and exclude crime-free street segments from the crime distributions. Results: The concentration of crime is highly unequal and stable over time. The specific street segments with the highest crime frequencies, however, change over time. Nontrivial fractions of street segments may appear among the 5% with the highest crime frequencies on the basis of chance. Spatial concentration of crime is reduced when crime-free street segments are excluded from the crime distributions. Conclusions: The law of crime concentration is not a measurement artifact.

For the optimal utilization of these predicted contacts in folding proteins accurately, it is important to study the challenges of reconstructing protein structures using true contacts. Because contact-guided protein modeling approach is valuable for predicting the folds of proteins that do not have structural templates, it is necessary for reconstruction studies to focus on hard-to-predict protein structures. Results: Using a data set consisting of 496 structural domains released in recent CASP experiments and a dataset of 150 representative protein structures, in this work, we discuss three techniques to improve the reconstruction accuracy using true contacts - adding secondary structures, increasing contact distance thresholds, and adding non-contacts. We find that reconstruction using secondary structures and contacts can deliver accuracy higher than using full contact maps. Similarly, we demonstrate that non-contacts can improve reconstruction accuracy not only when the used non-contacts are true but also when they are predicted. On the dataset consisting of 150 proteins, we find that by simply using low ranked predicted contacts as non-contacts and adding them as additional restraints, can increase the reconstruction accuracy by 5% when the reconstructed models are evaluated using TM-score. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that secondary structures are invaluable companions of contacts for accurate reconstruction. Confirming some earlier findings, we also find that larger distance thresholds are useful for folding many protein structures which cannot be folded using the standard definition of contacts. Our findings also suggest that for more accurate reconstruction using predicted contacts it is useful to predict contacts at higher distance thresholds (beyond 8Å) and predict non-contacts.",380,10.1186/s12859-017-1807-5,14712105,,National Institutes of Health,R01GM093123,85028471737 (Scopus),,1,,2017-08-29,28851269.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-017-1807-5,BMC Bioinformatics,18

In the experiments, we included positive, neutral, and negative conditions, with comparable arousal between positive and negative conditions. Both positive and negative conditions have higher arousal than neutral ones.

Methods: A multicenter observational study was conducted using electronic health records, and a survey of 1939 patients who were admitted to internal medicine units and followed until discharge. Those with previously diagnosed diabetes, newly diagnosed diabetes, or impaired fasting glucose were included. Aspects of glycemic management examined were (a) hyperglycemia, (b) endocrinology consultation for hyperglycemia and (c) hypoglycemia. Results: The prevalence of hyperglycemia in internal medicine was 45.7% (886 out of 1939). A total of 741 (83.6%) patients were treated by non-endocrinology departments; of those, 230 (31.1%) were in poor glycemic control and needed an endocrinology consultation. Yet only 57 (24.8%) received one. In 4 cases, the physician did not follow the consultants’ advice. Among the remaining 53 consulted patients, 35 (66.1%) were still in poor glycemic control, yet only about half received a second consultation. Finally, among patients treated in non-endocrinology departments, 58 (7.8%) had hypoglycemia; less than half retested their blood glucose after treatment. Conclusions: The majority of patients with hyperglycemia were in non-endocrinology departments.

They are restricted to mountain habitat above 1300 m and have allopatric populations resulting from climatic oscillations of the Plio-Pleistocene periods. Anthropogenic landscape changes and over-collection for the pet trade have resulted in dramatic population declines over the past four decades. While we have some insights into spatial ecology and habitat use of this species, we know nothing about their population structure. We examined the genetic diversity and population structure of Armenian Vipers inhabiting an agricultural landscape and a recovered-natural landscape separated by 397 km. We used seven microsatellite loci to genotype 63 individuals representing two sampling locations in each of the two sites. There were no indications of population bottlenecks within any of the sampling locations. While we found evidence of inbreeding at one of the locations in the agricultural landscape, the FST value indicates that individuals can still make contact with one another. We found no significant differentiation between sampling locations at the local scale (FST values of 0.03 to 0.006), but highly significant differentiation between the geographically separated populations (FST ranged from 0.14 to 0.20).

We investigate the dynamic evolution of hummingbird and bat pollination syndromes in the centropogonid clade (Lobelioideae: Campanulaceae), an Andean-centered group of ∼550 angiosperm species. We demonstrate that flowers hypothesized to be adapted to different pollinators based on flower color fall into distinct regions of morphospace, and this is validated by morphology of species with known pollinators. This supports the existence of pollination syndromes in the centropogonids, an idea corroborated by ecological studies. We further demonstrate that hummingbird pollination is ancestral, and that bat pollination has evolved ∼13 times independently, with ∼11 reversals. This convergence is associated with correlated evolution of floral traits within selective regimes corresponding to pollination syndrome. Collectively, our results suggest that floral morphological diversity is extremely labile, likely resulting from selection imposed by pollinators. Finally, even though this clade's rapid diversification is partially attributed to their association with vertebrate pollinators, we detect no difference in diversification rates between hummingbird- and bat-pollinated lineages.

We compared tree recruitment after a decade in three restoration treatments (natural regeneration, applied nucleation/island tree planting and plantation) and nearby reference forest in the premontane rain forest zone in southern Costa Rica. The study was replicated at 13 sites with a range of surrounding forest cover, enabling us to evaluate the relative influence of local restoration treatments and landscape forest cover on tree recruitment. Density of small-seeded (<5 mm), animal-dispersed recruits was lower in natural regeneration than in applied nucleation, plantation or reference forest plots. Species richness, species density and density of medium (5–10 mm)- and large (>10 mm)-seeded, animal-dispersed recruits were greatest in reference forest, intermediate in applied nucleation and plantation and lowest in natural regeneration plots.

Up-regulation resulted in more negative self-reported valence, while down-regulation resulted in less negative self-reported valence regardless of stimulus arousal, suggesting that subjective reappraisal success does not vary with emotional intensity.

However, in wild populations, temporal variation in parasite distributions and concomitant infections can alter these patterns. We used microscropy and molecular methods to screen for naturally occurring haemoparasitic infections in two Neotropical primate host populations, the saddleback (Leontocebus weddelli) and emperor (Saguinus imperator) tamarin, in the lowland tropical rainforests of southeastern Peru. Repeat sampling was conducted from known individuals over a three-year period to test for parasite-host and parasite-parasite associations. Three parasites were detected in L. weddelli including Trypanosoma minasense, Mansonella mariae, and Dipetalonema spp., while S. imperator only hosted the latter two. Temporal variation in prevalence was observed in T. minasense and Dipetalonema spp., confirming the necessity of a multi-year study to evaluate parasite-host relationships in this system. Although callitrichids display a distinct reproductive dominance hierarchy, characterized by single breeding females that typically mate polyandrously and can suppress the reproduction of subdominant females, logistic models did not identify sex or breeding status as determining factors in the presence of these parasites. However, age class had a positive effect on infection with M. mariae and T. minasense, and adults demonstrated higher parasite species richness than juveniles or sub-adults across both species. Body weight had a positive effect on the presence of Dipetalonema spp. The inclusion of co-infection variables in statistical models of parasite presence/absence data improved model fit for two of three parasites.

A triangular mesh allows 3, dyadic and 7 refinements. The 3-refinement is the most appealing one for multiresolution data processing since it has the slowest progression through scale and provides more resolution levels within a limited capacity. The 3 refinement has been used for surface subdivision and for discrete global grid systems. Recently lifting scheme-based biorthogonal bivariate wavelets with high symmetry have been constructed for surface multiresolution processing. If biorthogonal wavelets (with either dyadic or 3 refinement) have certain smoothness, they will have big supports. In other words, the corresponding multiscale algorithms have large templates; and this is undesirable for surface processing. On the other hand, frames provide a flexibility for the construction of system generators (called framelets) with high symmetry and smaller supports. In this paper we study highly symmetric 3-refinement wavelet bi-frames for surface processing. We design the frame algorithms based on the vanishing moments and smoothness of the framelets.

The type of capacities, or technology alternatives, that a firm can acquire can be classified on two basic dimensions. The first dimension relates to the effects of scale via distinction between labor-intensive technologies and capital-intensive technologies. The second dimension relates to the effects of scope via distinction between product-dedicated and flexible technologies. Moreover, each product-dedicated and flexible technology can have different levels of labor or capital-intensity, leading to the joint effects of economies of scale and economies of scope.

These provided essential data for mission planning, large-scale context information for the coma and tails beyond the spacecraft and a way to directly compare 67P with other comets. The observations revealed 67P to be a relatively 'well-behaved' comet, typical of Jupiter family comets and with activity patterns that repeat from orbit to orbit.

Current diabetes self-management recommendations, targeting Mexican Americans in particular, remain largely broad (""reduce your calorie intake"" or ""cut back on carbs""), overly ambitious (""stop eating tortillas""), and relatively ineffective (Svedbo Engström et al., BMJ Open 6(3):e010249, 2016; Johansson et al., Int J Qual Stud Health Well-being 11, 2016; Oomen et al., The Diabetes Educ 25:220-225, 1999; Franek, Ont Health Technol Assess Ser 13(9):1-60, 2013; Purnell et al.

Methods: A secondary and focused analysis (N = 12) was performed on data gathered from a larger qualitative study (N = 16), which explored diabetes among Mexican-American women residing in rural South Texas. Results: Findings from the secondary analysis were that study informants elicited more realistic or contextually relevant, specific self-management strategies that reflected the cognitive, emotive, and behavioral areas but were reframed within the context of the Mexican-American culture. Self-management strategies fell into the categories of: (a) environmental controls, (b) avoiding overeating, (c) lifestyle changes, (d) cooking tips, and (e) active self-management. Conclusions: Diabetes remains a serious health threat to Mexican Americans, women in particular. Few individuals attain glycemic control, likely due in part to the disconnect between global and non-contextual self-management recommendations offered by health care providers and the need for more detailed and realistic guidance required for the day-to-day self-management of diabetes.",36,10.1186/s12912-017-0232-4,14726955,,National Institutes of Health,P20GM103474,85021863932 (Scopus),,1,,2017-07-06,,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12912-017-0232-4,BMC Nursing,16

Methods: Following primary care visits, patients completed anonymous exit questionnaires that included the 3 Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test—Consumption (AUDIT-C) questions, “How many drinks (containing alcohol) can you safely have in one day?” and questions about size, in ounces, of a standard drink of wine, beer, and liquor. Descriptive analyses were done in Stata. Results: Of 1,331 respondents (60% female, mean age: 49.6, SD = 17.5), 21% screened positive on the AUDIT-C for risky drinking. Only 10% of those accurately estimated daily low-risk limits, with 9% accurate on weekly limits, and half estimated low-risk limits at or below guidelines. Fewer than half who checked “Yes” to “Do you know what a ‘standard drink’ is?” provided accurate answers for beer, wine, or liquor. Patients with a positive screen were twice as likely to say they knew what a standard drink is, but only a third gave accurate estimates. When asked about plans in the next month regarding change in drinking behavior, 23% with a positive AUDIT-C indicated they were at least considering a change. Conclusions: Most patients in primary care don't know specifics of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) guidelines for low-risk drinking. Exploring patient perceptions of low-risk guidelines and current drinking behavior may reveal discrepancies worth discussing. For risky drinkers, most of whom don't know daily and weekly low-risk guidelines or standard drink sizes, education can be vital in intervening.

On Santa Cruz Island, the abundance of introduced plant species is low in the arid lowlands of the Galapagos National Park, but increases with elevation into unprotected humid highlands. Two common alien plant species, guava (Psidium guajava) and passion fruit (Passiflora edulis) occur at higher elevations yet their seeds are dispersed into the lowlands by migrating Galapagos tortoises (Chelonoidis spp.). Tortoises transport large quantities of seeds over long distances into environments in which they have little or no chance of germination and survival under current climate conditions. However, climate change is projected to modify environmental conditions on Galapagos with unknown consequences for the distribution of native and introduced biodiversity. We quantified seed dispersal of guava and passion fruit in tortoise dung piles and the distribution of adult plants along two elevation gradients on Santa Cruz to assess current levels of ‘wasted’ seed dispersal. We computed species distribution models for both taxa under current and predicted future climate conditions. Assuming that tortoise migratory behaviour continues, current levels of “wasted” seed dispersal in lowlands were projected to decline dramatically in the future for guava but not for passion fruit. Tortoises will facilitate rapid range expansion for guava into lowland areas within the Galapagos National Park where this species is currently absent. Coupled with putative reduction in arid habitat for native species caused by climate change, tortoise driven guava invasion will pose a serious threat to local plant communities.",e0181333,10.1371/journal.pone.0181333,19326203,,National Science Foundation,1258062,85026219880 (Scopus),,7,,2017-07-01,28727747.0,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0181333,PLoS ONE,12

In addition to thyA, Bacillus subtilis possesses thyB, whose expression occurs under conditions of cell stress; therefore, we generated a thyB- thyA+ mutant strain. Tmpr colonies of this strain were produced with a spontaneous mutation frequency of ∼1.4 × 10-9. Genetic disruption of the canonical mismatch (MMR) and guanine oxidized (GO) repair pathways increased the Tmpr frequency of mutation by ∼2-3 orders of magnitude. A wide spectrum of base substitutions as well as insertion and deletions in the ORF of thyA were found to confer a Tmpr phenotype. Stationary-phase-associated mutagenesis (SPM) assays revealed that colonies with a Tmpr phenotype, accumulated over a period of ten days with a frequency of ∼ 60 ×10-7. The Tmpr system was further modified to study TMM by constructing a ΔthyA ΔthyB strain carrying an IPTG-inducible Pspac-thyA cassette. In conditions of transcriptional induction of thyA, the generation of Tmpr colonies increased ∼3-fold compared to conditions of transcriptional repression. Further, the Mfd and GreA factors were necessary for the generation of Tmpr colonies in the presence of IPTG in B. subtilis.

Associations between traits, such as body size, and migration provide clues. For example, larger species and individuals are more likely to migrate. One explanation for this size bias in migration is that larger animals are capable of moving faster (movement hypothesis). However, body size is linked to many other biological processes. For instance, the energetic balances of larger animals are generally more sensitive to variation in food density because of body size effects on foraging and metabolism and this sensitivity could drive migratory decisions (forage hypothesis). Identifying the primary selective forces that drive migration ultimately requires quantifying fitness impacts over the full annual migratory cycle. Here, we develop a full annual migratory cycle model from metabolic and foraging theory to compare the importance of the forage and movement hypotheses. We parameterize the model for Galapagos tortoises, which were recently discovered to be size-dependent altitudinal migrants. The model predicts phenomena not included in model development including maximum body sizes, the body size at which individuals begin to migrate, and the seasonal timing of migration and these predictions generally agree with available data. Scenarios strongly support the forage hypothesis over the movement hypothesis. Furthermore, male Galapagos tortoises on Santa Cruz Island would be unable to grow to their enormous sizes without access to both highlands and lowlands. Whereas recent research has focused on links between traits and the migratory phases of the migratory cycle, we find that effects of body size on the non-migratory phases are far more important determinants of the propensity to migrate. Larger animals are more sensitive to changing forage conditions than smaller animals with implications for maintenance of migration and body size in the face of environmental change.",,10.1111/1365-2656.12679,13652656,972,National Science Foundation,1258062,85019495834 (Scopus),00218790,4,982,2017-07-01,28390059.0,https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12679,Journal of Animal Ecology,86

One of our results show that according to robust solutions, the total capacity may not be fully utilized because of the distinction between largest (in unit terms) and costliest demand realizations.

NeuroQuant® is one such tool that has recently been used in clinical settings. Accurate volumetric data are useful in many clinical indications; therefore, it is important to assess the intermethod reliability and concurrent validity of similar volume quantifying tools.

Groups included mTBI (n = 71), posttraumatic stress disorder (n = 22), or a noncranial orthopedic injury (n = 55). Correlation coefficients and nonparametric group mean comparisons were used to assess reliability and concurrent validity, respectively. RESULTS: Comparison of these methods across our entire sample demonstrates generally fair to excellent reliability as evidenced by large intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC =.4 to.99), but little concurrent validity as evidenced by significantly different Mann-Whitney U comparisons for 26 of 30 brain structures measured.

We use island isolation following postglacial sea-level rise, ca. 2.5 ka, to characterize long-term change in insular assemblages of hemosporidian parasites. We find that assemblages on formerly connected islands are as differentiated as assemblages on islands that have never been connected, and both are more differentiated than local assemblages sampled up to two decades apart.

Theory suggests that the value of collecting information, or sampling, depends on environmental persistence and on the relative costs of making wrong decisions. However, empirical tests of how these variables interact are lacking.We tested whether bumblebee foraging decisions are indeed influenced by these two factors. We gave bees repeated choices between a resource providing a steady, mediocre reward and a resource fluctuating between a low reward and a high reward. In this paradigm, we manipulated environmental persistence by changing how long the quality of a fluctuating resource remained stable at one reward level. We manipulated the costs of decision errors by changing the relative values of the available rewards. Bees sampled the fluctuating resource more frequently when it changed quality more frequently, indicating that they measured environmental persistence and reacted to it as predicted by theory. Bees showed surprisingly suboptimal tracking, not reliably choosing the currently best resource except when the fluctuating resource was very persistent and the potential rewards high. While bees modify their choices in response to different levels of change and potential rewards, they do not always do so according to optimality predictions.",20160149,10.1098/rsfs.2016.0149,20428901,,National Institutes of Health,0921280,85018684159 (Scopus),20428898,3,,2017-06-06,,https://doi.org/10.1098/rsfs.2016.0149,Interface Focus,7

In this study, we test this prediction by analysing a comprehensive dataset of forest communities that covers all forest biomes across the world. Furthermore, within a forest community, vegetation layers from understorey to canopy could be considered a gradient of biotic interaction, on one hand, and an environmental gradient, on the other hand. We assess trends of phylogenetic relatedness of tree species across strata of forests in different forest biomes across the world. Location: Global. Method: We analysed 186 forest plots, each being 0.1 ha in size. For each forest plot, we divided stems into three stem-size classes. Net relatedness index (NRI) and nearest taxon index (NTI) for angiosperm woody plant assemblages were calculated for each forest plot and for each stem-size class of the plot. NRI and NTI of forest plots were related to temperature and precipitation in the framework of Whittaker's biome system. Results: When both deep and shallow evolutionary histories of woody species were considered, angiosperm woody plants tended to be more closely related in colder and/or drier climates. Phylogenetic relatedness was greater (i.e. more phylogenetic clustering) among trees with larger stems than among trees with smaller stems at the global scale. Main conclusions: Our finding that species are more closely related towards colder and/or dryer biomes is consistent with the prediction of the TNC hypothesis. The pattern of increasing phylogenetic relatedness towards the upper canopy layer of a forest is stronger in temperate compared to tropical regions, suggesting stronger environmental filtering in the more stressful canopy environment.",,10.1111/jbi.12936,13652699,1383,Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior,,85019619182 (Scopus),03050270,6,1392,2017-06-01,,https://doi.org/10.1111/jbi.12936,Journal of Biogeography,44

Here, we explore the mechanisms and trade-offs involved when Shewanella oneidensis, a bacterium that typically consumes small organic and amino acids, rapidly evolves to expand its metabolic capacity to catabolize glucose after a short period of adaptation to a glucose-rich environment. Using whole-genome sequencing and genetic approaches, we discovered that deletions in a region including the transcriptional repressor (nagR) that regulates the expression of genes associated with catabolism of N-acetylglucosamine are the common basis for evolved glucose metabolism across populations. The loss of nagR results in the constitutive expression of genes for an N-acetylglucosamine permease (nagP) and kinase (nagK). We demonstrate that promiscuous activities of both NagP and NagK toward glucose allow for the transport and phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate, the initial events of glycolysis otherwise thought to be absent in S. oneidensis. 13C-based metabolic flux analysis uncovered that subsequent utilization was mediated by the Entner-Doudoroff pathway. This is an example whereby gene loss and preexisting enzymatic promiscuity, and not gain-of-function mutations, were the drivers of increased metabolic capacity. However, we observed a significant decrease in the growth rate on lactate after adaptation to glucose catabolism, suggesting that trade-offs may explain why glycolytic function may not be readily observed in S. oneidensis in natural environments despite it being readily accessible through just a single mutational event.",e00827-16,10.1128/JB.00827-16,10985530,,,,85019073103 (Scopus),00219193,11,,2017-06-01,28289083.0,https://doi.org/10.1128/JB.00827-16,Journal of Bacteriology,199

However, when large clades of hosts and parasites are analyzed, some cases suggest host switching as another major diversification mechanism. The first step in host switching is the appearance of a parasite on an atypical host, or “straggling.” We analyze the conditions associated with straggling events. We use five species of colonially nesting seabirds from the Galapagos Archipelago and two genera of highly specific ectoparasitic lice to examine host switching. We use both genetic and morphological identification of lice, together with measurements of spatial distribution of hosts in mixed breeding colonies, to test: (1) effects of local host community composition on straggling parasite identity; (2) effects of relative host density within a mixed colony on straggling frequency and parasite species identity; and (3) how straggling rates are influenced by the specifics of louse attachment. Finally, we determine whether there is evidence of breeding in cases where straggling adult lice were found, which may indicate a shift from straggling to the initial stages of host switching. We analyzed more than 5,000 parasite individuals and found that only ~1% of lice could be considered stragglers, with ~5% of 436 host individuals having straggling parasites. We found that the presence of the typical host and recipient host in the same locality influenced straggling. Additionally, parasites most likely to be found on alternate hosts are those that are smaller than the typical parasite of that host, implying that the ability of lice to attach to the host might limit host switching. Given that lice generally follow Harrison's rule, with larger parasites on larger hosts, parasites infecting the larger host species are less likely to successfully colonize smaller host species. Moreover, our study supports the general perception that successful colonization of a novel host is extremely rare, as we found only one nymph of a straggling species, which may indicate successful reproduction.",,10.1002/ece3.2971,20457758,3724,American Museum of Natural History,2155,85018610242 (Scopus),,11,3731,2017-06-01,,https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.2971,Ecology and Evolution,7

We used molecular methods to screen 1343 individuals of 30 manakin species for the presence of parasites. We found no significant correlations between manakin parasite lineage turnover and both manakin species turnover and geographic distance. Climate differences, species turnover in the larger bird community and parasite lineage turnover in non-manakin hosts did not correlate with manakin parasite lineage turnover. We also found no evidence that manakin parasite lineage turnover among host species correlates with range overlap and genetic divergence among hosts.

Methods: Drawing on data from two Midwestern states, we utilize a quasi-experimental cohort-control group design to examine the correlates of county-level SORR violation rates among a cohort of post-SORR sex offender parolees, and three counterfactual cohorts (pre-SORR sex offenders, pre- and post-SORR non-sex offender parolees). We model the violation rate using a series of fractional logit regressions, examining the contribution of housing market, environmental justice, and system resource variables. Results: We observe that county-level variation in post-SORR sex offender violation rates is directly associated with concentrated disadvantage and the density of residence restrictions. The direct effect of concentrated disadvantage was unique to the post-SORR sex offender cohort. Model predictions suggest that the relationship between SORR density and concentrated disadvantage varies across the study states. Conclusions: The results suggest that factors found to be associated with sex offender clustering (i.e., housing market characteristics) are not associated with SORR violation rates.

Sixty-three healthy adults underwent neuropsychological evaluation and 3T brain magnetic resonance imaging. Cognitive performance was measured using the Repeatable Battery of Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). FBL was quantified from tractography tracings of white matter fiber bundles, derived from the diffusion tensor imaging. CR was determined by estimated premorbid IQ. Analyses revealed that lower scores on the RBANS were associated with shorter whole brain FBL (p = 0.04) and lower CR (p = 0.01) CR moderated the relationship between whole brain FBL and RBANS score (p < 0.01). Tract-specific analyses revealed that CR also moderated the association between FBL in the hippocampal segment of the cingulum and RBANS performance (p = 0.03). These results demonstrate that lower cognitive performance on the RBANS is more common with low CR and short FBL.

Even though her entry into politics was heavily indebted to her kinship ties to her father Park Jung-Hee, an authoritarian leader who led South Korea from 1963 to 1979, she has consolidated her position within the party and among Korean voters as a viable, competent politician over the last fifteen years. Analyzing Korean news reports, campaign pamphlets, and her autobiography, this study reveals that Park used stereotypes of women as problem solvers in difficult times to open doors for her political entry. During the presidential campaign in 2012, Park was adept at stressing her positive “feminine” traits, overcoming the perceived weaknesses of female politicians by emphasizing her long political credentials and strengths in diplomacy and national security issues.

According to our results, the EBT program had a negative and significant effect on the overall crime rate and specifically for burglary, assault, and larceny. The point estimates indicate that the overall crime rate decreased by 9.2 percent in response to the EBT program.

Bilaterally symmetrical corollas have evolved multiple times independently from radially symmetrical ancestors and likely represent adaptations to attract specific pollinators. On the other hand, losses of bilateral corolla symmetry have occurred sporadically in various groups, due to either modification of bilaterally symmetrical corollas in late development or early establishment of radial symmetry. Methods This study integrated phylogenetic, scanning electron microscopy (SEM)-based morphological, and gene expression approaches to assess the possible mechanisms underlying independent evolutionary losses of corolla bilateral symmetry. Key Results This work compared three species of Lamiaceae having radially symmetrical mature corollas with a representative sister taxon having bilaterally symmetrical corollas and found that each reaches radial symmetry in a different way. Higher core Lamiales share a common duplication in the CYCLOIDEA (CYC) 2 gene lineage and show conserved and asymmetrical expression of CYC2 clade and RAD genes along the adaxial-abaxial floral axis in species having bilateral corolla symmetry. In Lycopus americanus, the development and expression pattern of La-CYC2A and La-CYC2B are similar to those of their bilaterally symmetrical relatives, whereas the loss of La-RAD expression correlates with a late switch to radial corolla symmetry. In Mentha longifolia, late radial symmetry may be explained by the loss of Ml- CYC2A, and by altered expression of two Ml-CYC2B and Ml-RAD genes. Finally, expanded expression of Cc-CYC2A and Cc-RAD strongly correlates with the early development of radially symmetrical corollas in Callicarpa cathayana. Conclusions Repeated losses of mature corolla bilateral symmetry in Lamiaceae are not uncommon, and may be achieved by distinct mechanisms and various changes to symmetry genes, including the loss of a CYC2 clade gene from the genome, and/or contraction, expansion or alteration of CYC2 clade and RAD-like gene expression.",,10.1093/aob/mcx012,10958290,1211,National Science Foundation,DEB 1210540,85019898783 (Scopus),03057364,7,1223,2017-05-01,28334152.0,https://doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcx012,Annals of Botany,119

The Cryogenic Infrared Echelle Spectrograph at ESO-VLT detected infrared emissions from the three ""hypervolatiles"" (CO, CH4, and C2H6) that have the lowest sublimation temperatures among species that are commonly studied in comets by remote sensing. Even at R h = 3.25 au, the production rate of each molecule exceeded those measured for the same species in a number of other comets, although these comets were observed much closer to the Sun. Detections of CO at R h = 3.25, 4.03, and 4.73 au constrained its post-perihelion decrease in production rate, which most likely dominated the outgassing. At 3.25 au, our measured abundances scaled as CO/CH4/C2H6 ≈ 100/4.4/2.1. The C2H6/CH4 ratio falls within the range of previously studied comets at R h < 2 au, while CO/CH4 is comparatively high and similar to in situ measurements from Rosetta at ∼10 km from the nucleus of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko conducted at a very similar R h (3.15 au).

As TAG is produced from diacylglycerol (DAG), successful engineering strategies to enhance TAG levels have focused on the conversion of DAG to TAG. However, the production of TAG can be limited by flux through the enzymatic reactions that supply DAG. In this study, two Arabidopsis phospholipase Dz genes (AtPLDz1 and AtPLDz2 ) were coexpressed in Camelina sativa to test whether the conversion of phosphatidylcholine to DAG impacts TAG levels in seeds. The resulting transgenic plants produced 2% to 3% more TAG as a component of total seed biomass and had increased 18:3 and 20:1 fatty acid levels relative to wild type. Increased DAG and decreased PC levels were examined through the kinetics of lipid assembly by [14 C]acetate and [14 C]glycerol incorporation into glycerolipids. [14 C]acetate was rapidly incorporated into TAG in both wild-type and overexpression lines, indicating a significant flux of nascent and elongated acyl-CoAs into the sn-3 position of TAG. Stereochemical analysis revealed that newly synthesized fatty acids were preferentially incorporated into the sn-2 position of PC, but the sn-1 position of de novo DAG and indicated similar rates of nascent acyl groups into the Kennedy pathway and acyl editing.

Identification of the potentiating mutations and synergistic epistasis that enabled the evolution of inter-species cooperation,OA,Gold OA,-,-,Green Final OA,-,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0174345,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85018869451,,"Microbes often engage in cooperation through releasing biosynthetic compounds required by other species to grow. Given that production of costly biosynthetic metabolites is generally subjected to multiple layers of negative feedback, single mutations may frequently be insufficient to generate cooperative phenotypes. Synergistic epistatic interactions between multiple coordinated changes may thus often underlie the evolution of cooperation through overproduction of metabolites. To test the importance of synergistic mutations in cooperation we used an engineered bacterial consortium of an Escherichia coli methionine auxotroph and Salmonella enterica. S. enterica relies on carbon by-products from E. coli if lactose is the only carbon source. Directly selecting wild-type S. enterica in an environment that favored cooperation through secretion of methionine only once led to a methionine producer, and this producer both took a long time to emerge and was not very effective at cooperating. On the other hand, when an initial selection for resistance of S. enterica to a toxic methionine analog, ethionine, was used, subsequent selection for cooperation with E. coli was rapid, and the resulting double mutants were much more effective at cooperation. We found that potentiating mutations in metJ increase expression of metA, which encodes the first step of methionine biosynthesis. This increase in expression is required for the previously identified actualizing mutations in metA to generate cooperation. This work highlights that where biosynthesis of metabolites involves multiple layers of regulation, significant secretion of those metabolites may require multiple mutations, thereby constraining the evolution of cooperation.",e0174345,10.1371/journal.pone.0174345,19326203,,,,85018869451 (Scopus),,5,,2017-05-01,28493869.0,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0174345,PLoS ONE,12

We investigated the haemosporidian parasite faunas of migratory and resident birds to determine connections among distant parasite faunas, plausibly brought about by migratory host populations. Location: Samples were obtained, primarily during or shortly after the local breeding season, throughout the Americas, from the United States through the Caribbean Basin and into northern South America. Methods: Infections were identified by PCR and sequencing of parasite DNA in avian blood samples. The analyses were based on c. 4700 infections representing 79 parasite lineages of Plasmodium and Haemoproteus spp. Geographical connections of lineages between regions in the Americas were compared to those in the Euro-African migration system, where migration distances are longer for many host species and the migrant and resident avifaunas in the wintering areas are phylogenetically more divergent. Results: Haemosporidian lineages exhibited considerable variation in distribution in the Americas, and patterns of distribution differ markedly between the Americas and the Euro-African migration system. In particular, few lineages were recovered from resident species in both temperate and tropical latitudes, particularly in the Euro-African system, in which a large proportion of lineages were restricted to migrants. Parasite lineages in the Euro-African system exhibited considerable phylogenetic conservatism in their distributions, that is, a tendency of related lineages to exhibit similar geographical distributions. In contrast, clades of parasites in the Americas displayed more geographical diversity, with four of 12 clades exhibiting all four of the distribution types representing the combinations of resident and migrant host species in both temperate and tropical latitudes. Main conclusions: Long-distance migrants connect communities of avian haemosporidian parasites in breeding and wintering areas with disparate avifaunas and different vector communities.

The gap varies with a period of 50 fs and acts like a comb, filtering the original optical pulse to become an effective light pulse that has a period of 50 fs as well. The effective optical pulse thereby localizes the electron in the first 50 fs, yielding a hot exciton within 100 fs, which is in agreement with experimental results. Because of the prominent electron-lattice coupling of the conjugated polymer, the effective light field not only triggers lattice vibrations but also drives the hot exciton to undergo relaxation. During the relaxation over 1000 fs, the hot exciton loses its excess energy, finally completing its annealing process.",,10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b00863,19327455,8731,,,85020228877 (Scopus),19327447,16,8737,2017-04-27,,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b00863,Journal of Physical Chemistry C,121

Room temperature electrical conductivity improves from 6.11 × 10-8 S/m for BiOCl to 6.80 × 10-7 S/m for Bi0.7Fe0.3OCl. Correspondingly, the activation energy for electrical conduction reduces from 862 meV for pure BiOCl to 310 meV for Bi0.7Fe0.3OCl.

Additionally, proteins involved in 3' end processing, such as Symplekin, CPSF73 and CPSR100, have been recently implicated in the esiRNA pathway. Results: Here we present evidence of overlap between two essential RNA metabolic pathways: esiRNA biogenesis and mRNA 3' end processing. We have identified a nucleus-specific interaction between the essential esiRNA cleavage enzyme Dicer2 (Dcr2) and Symplekin, a component of the core cleavage complex (CCC) required for 3' end processing of all eukaryotic mRNAs. This interaction is mediated by the N-terminal 271 amino acids of Symplekin; CCC factors CPSF73 and CPSF100 do not contact Dcr2. While Dcr2 binds the CCC, Dcr2 knockdown does not affect mRNA 3' end formation. RNAi-depletion of CCC components Symplekin and CPSF73 causes perturbations in esiRNA abundance that correlate with fluctuations in retrotransposon and hairpin esiRNA precursor levels. We also discovered that esiRNAs generated from retrotransposons and hairpins have distinct physical characteristics including a higher predominance of 22 nucleotide hairpin-derived esiRNAs and differences in 3' and 5' base preference. Additionally, retrotransposon precursors and derived esiRNAs are highly enriched in the nucleus while hairpins and hairpin derived esiRNAs are predominantly cytoplasmic similar to canonical mRNAs. RNAi-depletion of either CPSF73 or Symplekin results in nuclear retention of both hairpin and retrotransposon precursors suggesting that polyadenylation indirectly affects cellular localization of Dcr2 substrates. Conclusions: Together, these observations support a novel mechanism in which differences in localization of esiRNA precursors impacts esiRNA biogenesis. Hairpin-derived esiRNAs are generated in the cytoplasm independent of Dcr2-Symplekin interactions, while retrotransposons are processed in the nucleus.",304,10.1186/s12864-017-3692-8,14712164,,National Institutes of Health,R15GM107931,85018472422 (Scopus),,1,,2017-04-17,28415970.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-017-3692-8,BMC Genomics,18

We analyse an agent-based null model, considering a case without selection—neutral evolution—in which organisms are defined only by phenotype. Universal dynamics has previously been demonstrated in a related model on a neutral fitness landscape, showing that this system belongs to the directed percolation (DP) universality class. The traditional null condition of neutral fitness (where fitness is defined as the number of offspring each organism produces) is extended here to include equal probability of death among organisms. We identify two types of phase transition: (i) a non-equilibrium DP transition through generational time (i.e. survival), and (ii) an equilibrium ordinary percolation transition through the phenotype space (based on links between mating organisms). Owing to the dynamical rules of the DP reaction–diffusion process, organisms can only sparsely fill the phenotype space, resulting in significant phenotypic diversity within a cluster of mating organisms. This highlights the necessity of understanding hierarchical evolutionary relationships, rather than merely developing taxonomies based on phenotypic similarity, in order to develop models that can explain phylogenetic patterns found in the fossil record or to make hypotheses for the incomplete fossil record of deep time.",170005,10.1098/rsos.170005,20545703,,,,85018624346 (Scopus),,4,,2017-04-12,,https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.170005,Royal Society Open Science,4

Veterans are at increased risk for opioid overdose compared with the civilian population, suggesting the need for enhanced efforts to address overdose prevention in Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care settings, such as primary care clinics. Methods: Prescribing providers (N = 45) completed surveys on baseline knowledge and concerns about the VA Overdose Education and Naloxone Distribution (OEND) initiative prior to attending an OEND educational training. Results: Survey items were grouped into 4 OEND-related categories, reflecting (1) lack of knowledge/familiarity/comfort; (2) concerns about iatrogenic effects; (3) concerns about impressions of unsafe opioid prescribing; and (4) concerns about risks of naloxone prescribing. Although certain OEND-related categories were associated with each other, concerns related to iatrogenic effects of OEND (e.g., patients will use more opioids and/or be less likely to see treatment) and lack of knowledge/familiarity/comfort with OEND were endorsed more than concerns related to giving impressions of unsafe opioid prescribing. The majority of providers endorsed the belief that those prescribing opioids to patients should be responsible for providing overdose education to those patients. System-wide naloxone prescription rates and sources increased over 320% following initiation of OEND expansion efforts, although these increases cannot be viewed as a direct result of the in-service trainings. Conclusions: Findings demonstrate that some providers believe they lack knowledge of opioid overdose prevention techniques and hold concerns about OEND implementation.

A second-order effect occurs through other papers that cited and relied upon certain findings in the retracted papers. This paper sets forth the recently retracted papers. It will also be useful in identifying second-order papers to assist editors, other reviewers, and researchers who otherwise may be unaware of retraction details as they are known at this time. This article sets forth Dr. Hunton's body of work with retractions noted. The article has several goals aimed at effective regulation of the accounting literature. First, it is a resource for researchers to determine whether a paper that they intend to cite has been retracted. Second, it encourages researchers to review and where feasible, replicate other papers authored by Dr. Hunton that have not been retracted to date in order to establish the legitimacy of those findings. Third, it encourages researchers to replicate or otherwise retest research questions in retracted papers so that reliable findings are made available to these questions. Fourth, at the second-order level, it encourages authors that have cited Dr. Hunton's papers to review their papers and where they deem it consistent with scholarly effort, restate their work. Similarly, editors of journals involved in the first- and second-order effects are encouraged to publish the additional analyses to reinforce the credibility of the literature.

Our model system is D-lactose. Barriers to the fundamental glyosidic bond cleavage reactions, neutral loss pathways, and structurally informative cross-ring cleavages are investigated. The most energetically favorable conformations of cationized D-lactose were found to be similar. In agreement with the literature, larger group I cations result in structures with increased cation coordination number which require greater collision energy to dissociate. In contrast with earlier proposals, the B n -Y m fragmentation pathways of both protonated and sodium-cationized analytes proceed via protonation of the glycosidic oxygen with concerted glycosidic bond cleavage. Additionally, for the sodiated congeners our calculations support sodiated 1,6-anhydrogalactose B n ion structures, unlike the preceding literature. This affects the subsequent propensity of formation and prediction of B n /Y m branching ratio. The nature of the anomeric center (α/β) affects the relative energies of these processes, but not the overall ranking. Low-energy cross-ring cleavages are observed for the metal-cationized analytes with a retro-aldol mechanism producing the 0,2 A 2 ion from the sodiated forms.

It seems clear that computing systems make decisions, in that they make choices between different options; and there is scholarship in philosophy that addresses the distinction between ethical decision-making and general decision-making.

This paper adds to the literature on inequities by examining the impact of pension plan formulas on pension benefits. Using data from the salary schedules of 464 Missouri school districts, this paper analyzes how various final average salary calculations would impact the benefits of teachers in different districts. All of the schools in this analysis belong to Missouri’s Public Employee Retirement System, which is a defined-benefit pension plan. A teacher’s benefit in this plan is based on her years of experience and her final average salary. The system uses a three-year final average salary calculation. This captures salaries when they are most inequitable, at the end of the schedule. When more years of service are used in the final average salary calculation, inequities in benefits are reduced, but not eliminated.",,,19446470,435,,,85028731589 (Scopus),00989495,4,447,2017-03-01,,,Journal of Education Finance,42

Identifying biomarkers that can improve diagnosis and prognostication has been at the forefront of recent research efforts. The purpose of this study was to compare the sensitivity and specificity of abnormalities identified using more traditional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences such as fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) to more advanced MRI sequences such as susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) among a cohort of active duty service members experiencing persistent cognitive symptoms after mTBI. One-hundred and fifty-two active duty service members (77 mTBI, 58 orthopedically injured [OI] only, 17 post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD] only) underwent MRI and neuropsychological evaluation at a large military treatment facility. Results demonstrated that FLAIR white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) were present in all three groups at statistically similar rates (41% mTBI, 49% OI, and 29% PTSD). With the exception of a single OI participant showing a small discrete SWI lesion, SWI abnormalities were overwhelmingly present in mTBI patients (22% mTBI, 1% OI, and 0% PTSD). Functionally, mTBI participants with and without SWI abnormalities did not differ in demographics, symptom reporting, or cognitive performance. However, mTBI participants with and without WMH did differ for on measures of working memory with the mTBI participants with WMH having worse cognitive performance. No other significant differences were noted for those participants with and without imaging abnormalities for either the OI or PTSD only cohorts. These results appear to illustrate the sensitivity and specificity of SWI findings though these results did not have any significant functional impact in this cohort.

Students are more willing to report misbehavior in schools with democratic authority structures and consistent enforcement of school rules. Attitudes toward reporting are less favorable when the school culture is supportive of a street code, and the effect of street code culture is fully explained by students’ personal norms and experiences.

Termed “clock-controlled genes,” these molecular outputs of the circadian clock orchestrate cellular, metabolic, and behavioral rhythms. As part of our on-going work to characterize key upstream regulators of circadian mRNA expression, we have identified a novel clock-controlled gene in Drosophila melanogaster, Achilles (Achl), which is rhythmic at the mRNA level in the brain and which represses expression of antimicrobial peptides in the immune system. Achilles knock-down in neurons dramatically elevates expression of crucial immune response genes, including IM1 (Immune induced molecule 1), Mtk (Metchnikowin), and Drs (Drosomysin). As a result, flies with knocked-down Achilles expression are resistant to bacterial challenges. Meanwhile, no significant change in core clock gene expression and locomotor activity is observed, suggesting that Achilles influences rhythmic mRNA outputs rather than directly regulating the core timekeeping mechanism. Notably, Achilles knock-down in the absence of immune challenge significantly diminishes the fly's overall lifespan, indicating a behavioral or metabolic cost of constitutively activating this pathway. Together, our data demonstrate that (1) Achilles is a novel clock-controlled gene that (2) regulates the immune system, and (3) participates in signaling from neurons to immunological tissues.",,10.1016/j.bbi.2016.11.012,10902139,127,National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases,R21AR069266,85008227684 (Scopus),08891591,,136,2017-03-01,27856350.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2016.11.012,"Brain, Behavior, and Immunity",61

Although NCEs are recognized as being important across disparate ecosystems, the factors influencing their strength and importance remain poorly understood. Ecological context, such as time of day, predator identity, and prey condition, may modify how prey species perceive and respond to risk, thereby altering NCEs. To investigate how predator identity affects foraging of herbivorous coral reef fishes, we simulated predation risk using fiberglass models of two predator species (grouper Mycteroperca bonaci and barracuda Sphyraena barracuda) with different hunting modes. We quantified how predation risk alters herbivory rates across space (distance from predator) and time (dawn, mid-day, and dusk) to examine how prey reconciles the conflicting demands of avoiding predation vs. foraging. When we averaged the effect of both predators across space and time, they suppressed herbivory similarly. Yet, they altered feeding differently depending on time of day and distance from the model. Although feeding increased strongly with increasing distance from the predators particularly during dawn, we found that the barracuda model suppressed herbivory more strongly than the grouper model during mid-day. We suggest that prey hunger level and differences in predator hunting modes could influence these patterns. Understanding how context mediates NCEs provides insight into the emergent effects of predator–prey interactions on food webs.

Here, we report on and compare the results of two long-term studies of the effects of logging on Lepidoptera in oak hickory forests. In one study, the Missouri Ozark Forest Ecosystem Project (MOFEP), caterpillars were used as response taxa. Sampling via observation without removal focused on larvae found on leaves of two dominant tree species, Quercus alba and Q. velutina, in alternative harvest regimes. In a second, the Hardwood Ecosystem Experiment of Indiana (HEE), we examined the response of adults to alternative harvest levels by sampling with blacklighting. Caterpillar sampling in MOFEP and in an associated chronosequence revealed that clearcutting decreases numbers and diversity of Lepidoptera, year effects were as important in influencing caterpillar assemblages as the harvest per se, and that species richness of caterpillars continued to increase each year post-harvest. When using adult moths as response taxa, species composition was resilient to timber harvest under shelterwood management, recovering to the near original condition three years post treatment. Communities in patch cut or clear cut stands were slower to recover, and appeared to develop novel communities relative to their pre-harvest condition. A late spring frost decreased abundance and species richness of caterpillars, while a severe drought impacted adult lepidopterans, depressing species richness in patch cut stands to a greater degree than in control or shelterwood cut stands.

This study introduces a new theoretical model, the Resource and Strategic Mobilization model (RSM), and empirically tests how personal resources and networks influence older persons’ participation in three major productive activities: employment, volunteering, and caregiving. Using nationally representative American data from the 2004 Health and Retirement Study, this study included 10,089 community-dwelling older adults aged 65+. Key predictor variables reflected aspects of personal resources (finances and physical health), and personal networks (family and social). Socio-demographic characteristics were controlled to obtain independent impacts from the above predictor variables. Three separate logistic regression models were utilized to test whether older people’s personal resources and networks influenced their engagement in employment, volunteering and caregiving. Findings showed that older Americans with greater financial resources were more likely to work and volunteer. In general, those with better health were more likely to participate in all three activities. Family networks were associated with providing care, and greater social network involvement was linked to volunteering. As the RSM predicts, the diverse contexts of older persons matter, as indicated by personal resources and networks, for the activities older adults are involved in.

There were no significant effects of therapist fidelity on session-to-session symptom change. However, results showed that overall high therapist competence for “skill in Socratic questioning” and “prioritizing assimilation before overaccommodation” were related to greater client improvement in PTSD severity, but “attention to practice assignments” and “emphasis on expression of natural affect” were not.

Once accessibility is given its due, physicalism must be reformulated and conceivability arguments must be reevaluated. To reach these conclusions, I explore a novel way of assessing the zombie conceivability argument. I accept that zombies are possible and ask whether that possibility is accessible from our world in the sense of ‘accessible’ used in possible world semantics. It turns out that the question whether zombie worlds are accessible from our world is equivalent to the question whether physicalism is true at our world. By assuming that zombie worlds are accessible from our world, proponents of the zombie conceivability argument beg the question against physicalism. In other words, it is a mistake to assume that the metaphysical possibility of zombies entails that physicalism is false at our world. I will then consider what happens if a proponent of the zombie conceivability argument should insist that zombie worlds are accessible from our world. I will argue that the same ingredients used in the zombie conceivability argument—whatever exactly they might be—can be used to construct an argument to the opposite conclusion. At that point, we reach a stalemate between physicalism and property dualism: while the possibility of zombies entails property dualism, the possibility of other creatures entails physicalism. Since these two possibilities are mutually inconsistent, either one of them is not genuine or one of them is inaccessible from the actual world.

In this study, we elucidate the phylogenetic relationships of the plant genus Burmeistera (Campanulaceae: Lobelioideae), while investigating how to best combine targeted Sanger loci with HTS data. We sequence, annotate, and analyze complete to nearly complete plastomes for a subset of the genus. We then combine these data with a much larger taxonomic dataset for which only Sanger sequences are available, making this the most comprehensively sampled study in the genus to date. We show that using a phylogeny inferred from the species with plastome data as a topological constraint for the larger dataset increases the resolution of our data and produces a more robust evolutionary hypothesis for the group. We then use the resulting phylogeny to study the evolution of morphological traits thought to be important in Burmeistera, and assess their usefulness in the current taxonomic classification of the genus. The main morphological character used to delimit subgeneric sections, the presence or absence of hairs on the apex of the two ventral anthers, shows a complex evolutionary history with many changes in the tree, suggesting that this character should not be used for taxonomic classification.

A lack of correlation between ecological gradients and SAD shape would suggest that SADs are caused by purely statistical reasons. We evaluated the variation in the shape of SADs for communities in landscapes of differing variable connectivity, environmental heterogeneity, species niches overlap and productivity. Location: Rainforests in the Madidi region (Bolivia). Methods: We compiled biological and environmental information on 65 sites (a site being a group of two to six 0.1-ha plots where woody plants of a diameter at breast height ≥ 2.5 cm were inventoried). We built unveiled (complete) SADs for each site and fitted Gambin models to those SADs. The Gambin α parameter served as a metric of SAD shape. Low α values characterize logseries-like SADs, while high α values characterize lognormal-like SADs. For each site, we estimated landscape roughness, environmental heterogeneity, species niche overlap and productivity. These variables were related to SAD shape by means of variation partitioning. Results: SADs changed from logseries-like to lognormal-like along the elevational gradient. Many of our predictor variables were correlated: 40.4% of the variation in SAD shape could not be attributed to specific factors. However, 50.62% of the variation in the SAD shape could be assigned to individual predictor matrices: 28.4% was explained exclusively by niche overlap, 15.41% exclusively by environmental heterogeneity, 5.20% exclusively by landscape roughness and 1.6% exclusively by productivity. Main conclusions: Ecological processes related to the topographical/environmental complexities that vary across the elevational gradient are correlated with the SAD shape. Purely statistical mechanisms are apparently not sufficient to explain the changes in SAD shape. The most important factor is the mean overlap of the niches of the species of an assemblage: avoiding competition with co-occurring species could be the most important mechanism driving species relative success at the ≤100 km2 scale.",,10.1111/geb.12531,14668238,191,National Science Foundation,0743457,84991782151 (Scopus),1466822X,2,202,2017-02-01,,https://doi.org/10.1111/geb.12531,Global Ecology and Biogeography,26

An analysis of the population structure of a set of 232 S. viridis lines, mostly from North America but also comprising some accessions from around the world, using 11 SSR markers, showed that S.viridis populations in the US largely separate by latitude and/or climatic zone. S. viridis populations from the Northern US and Canada (north of 44°N) group with accessions from Western Europe, while populations in the Mid and Southern US predominantly group with accessions from Turkey and Iran. We hypothesize that S. viridis in the US was most likely introduced from Europe, and that introductions were competitive only in regions that had climatic conditions that were similar to those in the regions of origins. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that Canadian S. viridis lines were fast cycling and undersized when grown in the Mid-Western and Southern US compared to their morphology in their native environment. A comparison of the population structure obtained with 11 SSR markers and ~40,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a common set of S. viridis germplasm showed that both methods essentially yielded the same groupings, although admixture was identified at a higher frequency in the SNP analysis.

Consequently, the ultrafast localized distortion of alternating bonds constructs ""instantaneous"" structures - an effective four-level electronic structure and population inversion - for ASE. It is shown that all the evolving localized vibrational modes possess even parity, which not only makes it highly possible to be probed through the infrared phonon spectrum, but also opens up an opportunity to improve the quantum efficiency of a polymer ASE/laser by modification of localized phonon modes.",,10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b11496,19327455,1055,,,85020211070 (Scopus),19327447,2,1061,2017-01-19,,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b11496,Journal of Physical Chemistry C,121

Here, we explored technetium- 99m labeled rhein derivatives for rapid imaging of the necrotic myocardium. Three hydrazinonicotinic acid-linker-rhein (HYNIC-linker-rhein) derivatives were synthesized, and then, these synthetic compounds were labeled with technetium- 99m using ethylenediaminediacetic acid (EDDA) and tricine as coligands [99mTc(EDDA)-HYNIC-linker-rhein]. The necrosis avidity of the three 99mTc-labeled rhein derivatives was tested in a mouse model of ethanol-induced muscular necrosis by gamma counting, histochemical staining, and autoradiography. A lead tracer for visualization of necrotic myocardium was assessed by single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) imaging in a rat model with reperfused myocardial infarction. The necrosis avidity mechanism of the tracer was explored by DNA binding studies in vitro and blocking experiments in vivo. Results showed that the uptake in necrotic muscles of the three 99mTc-compounds was higher than that in viable muscles (P < 0.001). Autoradiography and histochemical staining results were consistent with selective uptake of the radiotracer in the necrotic regions. Among the these tracers, 99mTc-HYNIC-ethylenediamine-rhein [99mTc-HYNIC-2C-rhein] displayed the best distribution profiles for imaging. The necrotic myocardium lesions were clearly visualized by SPECT/CT using 99mTc-HYNIC-2C-rhein at 1 h after injection. The necrotic-to-viable myocardium and necrotic myocardium-to-blood uptake ratios of 99mTc-HYNIC-2C-rhein were 4.79 and 3.02 at 1 h after injection. DNA binding studies suggested HYNIC-linker-rhein bound to DNA through intercalation. The uptake of 99mTc-HYNIC-2C-rhein in necrotic muscle was significantly blocked by excessive unlabeled rhein, with 77.61% decline at 1 h after coinjection. These findings suggested 99mTc-HYNIC-2C-rhein emerged as a ""hot spot"" imaging probe that has a potential for rapid imaging of necrotic myocardium.

One-third of its species present an unusual inflated berry. Unlike the bright colors of non-inflated fruits in the genus, these fruits are typically dull-green; however, the fact that the seeds are loosely held in the placenta and easily removed when touched seems to suggest adaptation to animal dispersal. We studied two inflated-baccate species, Burmeistera glabrata and B. borjensis, with the aim of testing the non-exclusive hypotheses that their seeds are dispersed by (1) small mammals, (2) slugs, or (3) adult flies that develop inside the fruits. In two sites in the Ecuadorian Andes, we performed observations at dusk and dawn to examine the fate of fruits and seeds; recording fruit fall, formation of holes in the fruits, and seed loss from the placenta. We documented fruit visitors with cameras, and surveyed unopened fruits for the presence of insect larvae and seed condition. Finally, we performed an experiment to examine the effect of holes and rain in germination, in order to evaluate if holes are required for seeds to leave the fruits and subsequently germinate. For both species, most fruits fell and decomposed beneath the mother plant. However, we found limited support for small mammal dispersal; videos and observations revealed that mice and squirrels are potential, but rare, seed dispersers. We found no evidence for slug or fly dispersal; fly larvae were common inside fruits, but acted exclusively as seed predators. Crickets often chewed holes in fruits on plants and on the ground. Holes did not have an effect on germination, which was induced only by rain. Hence, the majority of seeds end up under the mother plant, with rare but potentially important events of primary or secondary dispersal by small mammals. The combination of limited dispersal due to gravity and rare events of mammal dispersal may have played a critical role in the rapid diversification of Burmeistera.",,10.1080/23766808.2016.1258868,23766808,10,University of Missouri-St. Louis,,85063236239 (Scopus),,1,17,2017-01-01,,https://doi.org/10.1080/23766808.2016.1258868,Neotropical Biodiversity,3

We examined whether anatomical determinants of wood density and strength of the relationship between wood traits and vital rates shift between saplings and adults.

Vital rates for saplings and adults were obtained from an earlier study. KEY RESULTS: Anatomical predictors of wood density were similar for sapling and adult wood, with wood density variation largely explained by fiber lumen area and fiber wall fraction. In sapling wood only, growth rates decreased with fiber wall fraction and increased with fiber lumen area, while mortality rates increased with vessel area but decreased with fiber wall fraction and vessel density. CONCLUSIONS: Wood traits of sapling trees provide functional insight into the growth–mortality tradeoff. Sapling wood with relatively large fiber lumen area and wide vessels, enabling faster hydraulic transport but less mechanical strength, is associated with fast growth and high mortality. Sapling wood with relatively more fiber wall and many narrow vessels, enabling greater mechanical strength but slower hydraulic transport, is associated with slow growth and low mortality.",,10.3732/ajb.1700242,,1464,National Science Foundation,DEB585 1302797,85032697984 (Scopus),00029122,10,1473,2017-01-01,29885221.0,https://doi.org/10.3732/ajb.1700242,American Journal of Botany,104

Our model systems are the glucose-based disaccharide analytes cellobiose (β-d-glucopyranosyl-(1 → 4)-d-glucose) and gentiobiose (β-d-glucopyranosyl-(1 → 6)-d-glucose). These analytes show substantially different tandem mass spectra. We characterize the rate-determining barriers to both the glycosidic and structurally-informative cross-ring bond cleavages. Sodiated cellobiose produces abundant Y1 and B1 peaks. Our deuterium labelling and computational chemistry approach provides evidence for 1,6-anhydroglucose B1 ion structures rather than the 1,2-anhydroglucose and oxacarbenium ion structures proposed elsewhere. Unlike those earlier proposals, this finding is consistent with the experimentally observed Bn/Ym branching ratios. In contrast to cellobiose, sodiated gentiobiose primarily fragments by cross-ring cleavage to form various A2 ion types. Fragmentation is facilitated by ring-opening at the reducing end which enables losses of CnH2nOn oligomers. Deuterium labelling and theory enables rationalization of these processes. Theory and experiment also support the importance of consecutive fragmentation processes at higher collision energies.",,10.1039/c7cp04738j,,25643,Saudi Arabian Cultural Mission,,85030718347 (Scopus),14639076,37,25652,2017-01-01,28905070.0,https://doi.org/10.1039/c7cp04738j,Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics,19

Both S- and R-DEPP are poor inhibitors of eel AChE (IC50 150 μM), consistent with a large, nondiscriminatory binding interaction in the active site of this enzyme. However, S-DEPP is active against human and equine AChE with low μM IC50s. DEPP stereospecificities (S/R) toward these enzymes are moderate (20) relative to other cholinesterase-organophosphate (OP) systems. Pralidoxime, a common rescue agent, affects a modest recovery of both hAChE and eqBChE from treatment with S-DEPP.

Rudin, S. Osher, and E. Fatemi, Phys. D, 60 (1992), pp. 259-268] and its generalizations, nonlinear diffusions [P. Perona and J. Malik, IEEE Trans. Pattern Anal. Mach.

These approaches were developed through different paths and generally provided understanding from different angles of the same problem. As shown in numerical simulations, implementations of the wavelet frame based approach and the PDE based approach quite often end up solving a similar numerical problem with similar numerical behaviors, even though different approaches have advantages in different applications. Since wavelet frame based and PDE based approaches have all been modeling the same types of problems with success, it is natural to ask whether the wavelet frame based approach is fundamentally connected with the PDE based approach when we trace them all the way back to their roots. A fundamental connection of a wavelet frame based approach with a total variation model and its generalizations was established in [J. Cai, B. Dong, S. Osher, and Z. Shen, J. Amer. Math. Soc., 25 (2012), pp. 1033-1089]. This connection gives the wavelet frame based approach a geometric explanation and, at the same time, it equips a PDE based approach with a time frequency analysis. Cai et al. showed that a special type of wavelet frame model using generic wavelet frame systems can be regarded as an approximation of a generic variational model (with the total variation model as a special case) in the discrete setting. A systematic convergence analysis, as the resolution of the image goes to infinity, which is the key step in linking the two approaches, is also given in Cai et al. Motivated by Cai et al. and [Q. Jiang, Appl. Numer. Math., 62 (2012), pp. 51-66], this paper establishes a fundamental connection between the wavelet frame based approach and nonlinear evolution PDEs, provides interpretations and analytical studies of such connections, and proposes new algorithms for image restoration based on the new understandings. Together with the results in [J. Cai et al., J. Amer. Math. Soc., 25 (2012), pp. 1033-1089], we now have a better picture of how the wavelet frame based approach can be used to interpret the general PDE based approach (e.g., the variational models or nonlinear evolution PDEs) and can be used as a new and useful tool in numerical analysis to discretize and solve various variational and PDE models. To be more precise, we shall establish the following: (1) The connections between wavelet frame shrinkage and nonlinear evolution PDEs provide new and inspiring interpretations of both approaches that enable us to derive new PDE models and (better) wavelet frame shrinkage algorithms for image restoration. (2) A generic nonlinear evolution PDE (of parabolic or hyperbolic type) can be approximated by wavelet frame shrinkage with properly chosen wavelet frame systems and carefully designed shrinkage functions. (3) The main idea of this work is beyond the scope of image restoration. Our analysis and discussions indicate that wavelet frame shrinkage is a new way of solving PDEs in general, which will provide a new insight that will enrich the existing theory and applications of numerical PDEs, as well as those of wavelet frames.",,10.1137/15M1037457,15403467,606,,,85017034398 (Scopus),15403459,1,660,2017-01-01,,https://doi.org/10.1137/15M1037457,Multiscale Modeling and Simulation,15

Students are exposed to some of those skills if they take Career Technical Education (CTE) classes, but rarely do they see the connections in their core math classes. Math teachers have pointed to their dense curricula as making STEM integration impractical. A study of the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSS-M), however, reveals open doors for integration. There are specific Algebra I CCSS-M that can be met through STEM-oriented, problem-based learning (PBL). STEM PBL has the potential for increasing students' cognitive engagement while, at the same time, introducing interesting STEM careers. These connections need to be integrated in curricula aligned to the CCSS-M. In order to further develop and implement evolving STEMPBL connections, there is a need for increased, ongoing dialog between educational leadership and representatives from the STEM working community. The end result can be that most US students will be exposed to a much broader range of STEM careers, STEM skills, and understand how the Algebra they learn is useful in the real world.",,,15513440,413,,,85011305896 (Scopus),,1-3,434,2017-01-01,,,Mathematics Enthusiast,14
Short-wavelength light-blocking eyeglasses attenuate symptoms of eye fatigue,OA,Gold OA,-,-,-,Green Accepted OA,https://doi.org/10.1167/iovs.16-20663,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85010867843,"Blue light, CVS, Eye fatigue, Eye strain, VDT","PURPOSE. The purpose of this study was to determine whether subjects who wear short wavelength–blocking eyeglasses during computer tasks exhibit less visual fatigue and report fewer symptoms of visual discomfort than subjects wearing eyeglasses with clear lenses. METHODS. A total of 36 healthy subjects (20 male; 16 female) was randomized to wearing noblock, low-blocking, or high-blocking eyeglasses while performing a 2-hour computer task. A masked grader measured critical flicker fusion frequency (CFF) as a metric of eye fatigue and evaluated symptoms of eye strain with a 15-item questionnaire before and after computer use. RESULTS. We found that the change in CFF after the computer task was significantly more positive (i.e., less eye fatigue) in the high-block versus the no-block (P = 0.027) and low-block (P = 0.008) groups. Moreover, random assignment to the high-block group but not to the low-block group predicted a more positive change in CFF (i.e., less eye fatigue) following the computer task (adjusted β = 2.310; P = 0.002). Additionally, subjects wearing high-blocking eyeglasses reported significantly less feeling pain around/inside the eye (P = 0.0063), less feeling that the eyes were heavy (P = 0.0189), and less feeling that the eyes were itchy (P = 0.0043) following the computer task, when compared to subjects not wearing high-blocking lenses. CONCLUSIONS. Our results support the hypothesis that short-wavelength light-blocking eyeglasses may reduce eye strain associated with computer use based on a physiologic correlate of eye fatigue and on subjects’ reporting of symptoms typically associated with eye strain.",,10.1167/iovs.16-20663,15525783,442,,,85010867843 (Scopus),01460404,1,447,2017-01-01,28118668.0,https://doi.org/10.1167/iovs.16-20663,Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science,58

This paper aims to explores the question: Does the regrowth of sizable consulting practices by the Big 4 influence audit reporting lag and restatement rates? Design/methodology/approach: A population of the SEC-registered US audit clients of the Big 4 was used in this study. Longitudinal data on Big 4 audit clients from 2000 through 2009 were analyzed to determine the impact of consulting practice size on the clients’ audit reporting lag and restatement rate. Findings: This paper finds that consulting practice size has a positive and statistically significant influence on audit reporting lag and restatement rate. The results are robust to alternative specifications of the sample and controlling for the level of non-audit services provided to audit clients. Practical implications: The findings contribute to the discussion of the scope-of-services issue. They provide empirical support for Zeff’s (2003) and Wyatt’s (2004) intuition that the loss of Big 4 professional focus – not simply conflicts of interests – is a major factor affecting the audit quality. Originality/value: The uniqueness of this paper is in how it counts restatements. Each year this paper counts that annual financial statements are restated as opposed to each disclosure of a restatement. This paper’s contribution is to examine the association between the regrowth of Big 4 accounting firm consulting practices with audit reporting lag and restatements.",,10.1108/MAJ-02-2016-1321,,19,,,85008429074 (Scopus),02686902,1,49,2017-01-01,,https://doi.org/10.1108/MAJ-02-2016-1321,Managerial Auditing Journal,32

Methods A customized heterochromatic flicker photometer (cHFP) device was used to measure MPOD spatial distribution across the central 16° using a 1° stimulus. MPOD was calculated as a discrete measure and summed measures across the central 1°, 3.3°, 10° and 16° diameters. Intraocular scatter was determined as a mean of 5 trials in which reliability and repeatability measures were met using the C-Quant. MPOD spatial distribution maps were constructed and the effects of both discrete and summed values on intraocular scatter were examined. Results Spatial mapping identified mean values for discrete MPOD [0.32 (s.d. = 0.08)], MPOD summed across central 1° [0.37 (s.d. = 0.11)], MPOD summed across central 3.3° [0.85 (s.d. = 0.20)], MPOD summed across central 10° [1.60 (s.d. = 0.35)] and MPOD summed across central 16° [1.78 (s.d. = 0.39)]. Mean intraocular scatter was 0.83 (s.d. = 0.16) log units. While there were consistent trends for an inverse relationship between MPOD and scatter, these relationships were not statistically significant. Correlations between the highest and lowest quartiles of MPOD within the central 1° were near significance.

The well-known proline effect is eliminated and amide bond cleavage C-terminal to pipecolic acid dominates instead. Why do these two ostensibly similar residues produce dramatically differing spectra? Recent evidence indicates that the proton affinities of these residues are similar, so are unlikely to explain the result [Raulfs et al., J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 25, 1705–1715 (2014)]. An additional hypothesis based on increased flexibility was also advocated. Here, we provide a computational investigation of the “pipecolic acid effect,” to test this and other hypotheses to determine if theory can shed additional light on this fascinating result. Our calculations provide evidence for both the increased flexibility of pipecolic-acid-containing peptides, and structural changes in the transition structures necessary to produce the sequence ions. The most striking computational finding is inversion of the stereochemistry of the transition structures leading to “proline effect”-type amide bond fragmentation between the proline/pipecolic acid-congeners: R (proline) to S (pipecolic acid). Additionally, our calculations predict substantial stabilization of the amide bond cleavage barriers for the pipecolic acid congeners by reduction in deleterious steric interactions and provide evidence for the importance of experimental energy regime in rationalizing the spectra.

White matter integrity in high-altitude pilots exposed to hypobaria,OA,-,-,-,-,Green Accepted OA,https://doi.org/10.3357/AMHP.4585.2016,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85018784658,"hypobaric exposure, U-2 pilots, White matter integrity","INTRODUCTION: Nonhypoxic hypobaric (low atmospheric pressure) occupational exposure, such as experienced by U.S. Air Force U-2 pilots and safety personnel operating inside altitude chambers, is associated with increased subcortical white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this discrete WMH change remain unknown. The objectives of this study were to demonstrate that occupational exposure to nonhypoxic hypobaria is associated with altered white matter integrity as quantified by fractional anisotropy (FA) measured using diffusion tensor imaging and relate these findings to WMH burden and neurocognitive ability. METHODS: There were 102 U-2 pilots and 114 age- and gender-controlled, health-matched controls who underwent magnetic resonance imaging. All pilots performed neurocognitive assessment. Whole-brain and tract-wise average FA values were compared between pilots and controls, followed by comparison within pilots separated into high and low WMH burden groups. Neurocognitive measurements were used to help interpret group difference in FA values. RESULTS: Pilots had significantly lower average FA values than controls (0.489/0.500, respectively). Regionally, pilots had higher FA values in the fronto-occipital tract where FA values positively correlated with visual-spatial performance scores (0.603/0.586, respectively). There was a trend for high burden pilots to have lower FA values than low burden pilots. DISCUSSION: Nonhypoxic hypobaric exposure is associated with significantly lower average FA in young, healthy U-2 pilots. This suggests that recurrent hypobaric exposure causes diffuse axonal injury in addition to focal white matter changes.",,10.3357/AMHP.4585.2016,23756322,983,National Institutes of Health,5K25DK089012,85018784658 (Scopus),23756314,12,988,2016-12-01,28323582.0,https://doi.org/10.3357/AMHP.4585.2016,Aerospace Medicine and Human Performance,87

Co-occurrence patterns in a diverse arboreal ant community are explained more by competition than habitat requirements,OA,Gold OA,-,-,Green Final OA,-,https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.2606,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85005847215,"assembly rules, Brazil, canopy, Cerrado, community assembly, niche, species coexistence","A major goal of community ecology is to identify the patterns of species associations and the processes that shape them. Arboreal ants are extremely diverse and abundant, making them an interesting and valuable group for tackling this issue. Numerous studies have used observational data of species co-occurrence patterns to infer underlying assembly processes, but the complexity of these communities has resulted in few solid conclusions. This study takes advantage of an observational dataset that is unusually well-structured with respect to habitat attributes (tree species, tree sizes, and vegetation structure), to disentangle different factors influencing community organization. In particular, this study assesses the potential role of interspecific competition and habitat selection on the distribution patterns of an arboreal ant community by incorporating habitat attributes into the co-occurrence analyses. These findings are then contrasted against species traits, to explore functional explanations for the identified community patterns. We ran a suite of null models, first accounting only for the species incidence in the community and later incorporating habitat attributes in the null models. We performed analyses with all the species in the community and then with only the most common species using both a matrix-level approach and a pairwise-level approach. The co-occurrence patterns did not differ from randomness in the matrix-level approach accounting for all ant species in the community. However, a segregated pattern was detected for the most common ant species. Moreover, with the pairwise approach, we found a significant number of negative and positive pairs of species associations. Most of the segregated associations appear to be explained by competitive interactions between species, not habitat affiliations. This was supported by comparisons of species traits for significantly associated pairs. These results suggest that competition is the most important influence on the distribution patterns of arboreal ants within the focal community. Habitat attributes, in contrast, showed no significant influence on the matrix-wide results and affected only a few associations. In addition, the segregated pairs shared more biological characteristic in common than the aggregated and random ones.",,10.1002/ece3.2606,20457758,8907,National Science Foundation,DEB 0842144,85005847215 (Scopus),,24,8918,2016-12-01,,https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.2606,Ecology and Evolution,6

In light of its theoretical significance, including the “escape from awareness” model of binge eating, surprisingly few empirical evaluations have examined the empirical evidence for this variable in relation to anxiety and binge eating symptoms. In addition, although it is understood that anxiety is more prevalent among women than men, empirical investigations of gender differences in cognitive avoidance in binge eating are thus far absent from the published literature. Methods: Participants (N = 436) were recruited from diverse geographic regions across the United States to take part in an online study. Cognitive avoidance, anxiety, and binge eating measures were collected. Results: Cognitive avoidance partially mediated the relation between anxiety and binge eating in the full sample; however, results differed across genders. Specifically, cognitive avoidance was a mediator for women, but not for men. Conclusions: Findings support the “escape from awareness” model of binge eating among women, and suggest that targeting cognitive avoidance in binge eating treatment may be a promising clinical avenue.

Using the surface area for np-Au determined by oxide stripping, the values of kapp for the alkanethiol modified np-Au are initially over two orders of magnitude smaller than the values found on flat Au. This result provides evidence that the diffusing redox probe Fe(CN)63 −/4 − only accesses a fraction of the np-Au surface after alkanethiol modification suggesting very limited wetting of the internal pores due to the hydrophobic nature of these surfaces. In contrast, for np-Au modified by carbohydrate-terminated (mannose or galactose) alkanethiols the values of kapp are about 10–40 fold smaller than on flat gold, suggesting more extensive access of the diffusing redox probe within the pores and better but still incomplete wetting, a result also found for modification of np-Au with mercaptododecanoic acid. A short chain PEG thiol derivative is found to result in a comparison of kapp values that suggests nearly complete wetting of the internal pores for this highly hydrophilic derivative.

Methods: We apply two techniques commonly employed in the field of demography, age-standardization and decomposition, to data provided by the Bureau of Justice Statistics and the 2010 decennial census to assess the contribution of age structure to racial and ethnic disparities in incarceration. Findings: The non-Hispanic black and Hispanic incarceration rates in 2010 would have been 13–20 % lower if these groups had age structures identical to that of the non-Hispanic white population. Moreover, age structure accounts for 20 % of the Hispanic/white disparity and 8 % of the black/white disparity.

Many students initially privileged natural language over the data represented on the graph and sought ways to explain how the incorrect description could somehow be construed as accurate. Although these students could successfully complete school assignments related to graphs, their skills in reading authentic, real-world science communication was limited. We recommend that teachers invite discussion of various semiotic forms rather than scaffold for correctness. Students have learned to do schoolwork, but they are much less able to engage critically in real-world science.",,10.1007/s10763-015-9677-7,15731774,1387,National Science Foundation,DRL-0822354,84940916599 (Scopus),15710068,8,1406,2016-12-01,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10763-015-9677-7,International Journal of Science and Mathematics Education,14

We found that species differed strongly in their contributions to the organization of the multi-interaction network, and that only a few species contributed to the structuring of these patterns. Moreover, we observed that the multi-interaction networks did not enhance community robustness compared with each of the three independent mutualistic networks when analysed across a range of simulated scenarios of species extinction. By simulating the removal of highly interacting species, we observed that, overall, these species enhance network nestedness and robustness, but decrease modularity. We discuss how the organization of interlinked mutualistic networks may be essential for the maintenance of ecological communities, and therefore the long-term ecological and evolutionary dynamics of interactive, species-rich com munities.

Recent evidence suggests that natural enemies could play an important role in the assembly of hyper-diverse tropical plant systems. Classic ecological theory predicts that in order for coexistence to occur, species differences must be maximized across biologically important niche dimensions. For plant-herbivore interactions, it has been recently suggested that, within a particular community, plant species that maximize the difference in chemical defense profiles compared to neighboring taxa will have a relative competitive advantage. Here we tested the hypothesis that plant chemical diversity can affect local community composition in the hyper-diverse genus Piper at a lowland wet forest location in Costa Rica. We first characterized the chemical composition of 27 of the most locally abundant species of Piper. We then tested whether species with different chemical compositions were more likely to coexist. Finally, we assessed the degree to which Piper phylogenetic relationships are related to differences in secondary chemical composition and community assembly. We found that, on average, co-occurring species were more likely to differ in chemical composition than expected by chance. Contrary to expectations, there was no phylogenetic signal for overall secondary chemical composition. In addition we found that species in local communities were, on average, more phylogenetically closely related than expected by chance, suggesting that functional traits other than those measured here also influence local assembly. We propose that selection by herbivores for divergent chemistries between closely related species facilitates the coexistence of a high diversity of congeneric taxa via apparent competition.",,10.1002/ecy.1536,19399170,3176,,,84994589885 (Scopus),00129658,11,3183,2016-11-01,27870051.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.1536,Ecology,97

There have been no explicit tests of their hypotheses. Indeed there were no proposed mechanisms either at the time or since by which herbivores might generate new plant species. Here we outline two main classes of mechanisms, prezygotic and postzygotic, with a number of scenarios in each by which herbivore-driven changes in host plant secondary chemistry might lead to new plant lineage production. The former apply mainly to a sympatric model of speciation while the latter apply to a parapatric or allopatric model. Our review suggests that the steps of each mechanism are known to occur individually in many different systems, but no scenario has been thoroughly investigated in any one system. Nevertheless, studies of Dalechampia and its herbivores and pollinators, and patterns of defense tradeoffs in trees on different soil types in the Peruvian Amazon provide evidence consistent with the original hypotheses of Ehrlich and Raven. For herbivores to drive sympatric speciation, our findings suggest that interactions with both their herbivores and their pollinators should be considered. In contrast, herbivores may drive speciation allopatrically without any influence by pollinators. Finally, there is evidence that these mechanisms are more likely to occur at low latitudes and thus more likely to produce new species in the tropics. The mechanisms we outline provide a predictive framework for further study of the general role that herbivores play in diversification of their host plants.",,10.1002/ecy.1534,19399170,2939,,,84994553194 (Scopus),00129658,11,2951,2016-11-01,27870033.0,https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.1534,Ecology,97

The primary aim of the present study was to investigate whether demographic factors and pretreatment symptom levels were associated with premature termination among children who received trauma-focused treatment. Because different definitions of attrition may influence results, candidate factors were examined in relation to 2 operational definitions of attrition. Method: Four hundred and sixty-six children (ages 2-18 years; M = 9.23, SD = 3.78; 66.1% females) who were referred to a Child Advocacy Center (CAC) for trauma-focused therapy were included in the study. Demographic and family variables, characteristics of the traumatic event, and caregiver-and child-reported pretreatment symptoms levels were assessed in relation to both clinicianrated treatment status and whether the child received an adequate dose of treatment (i.e., ≥12 sessions). Results: Several demographic factors (e.g., child's age, minority status, household income, maternal years of education), Child Protective Services (CPS) involvement, type of treatment received, number of traumatic events, and caregiver-rated pretreatment symptom levels were related to clinician-rated treatment status. Relatively fewer factors were associated with the adequate dose operationalization of attrition. Children's symptom reports were unrelated to either attrition definition.

Design: A multimethod qualitative design was used. Thirty adults 60 years of age with (a) at least three chronic medical diagnoses, (b) at least five medications at baseline, and (c) a new medication prescription were enrolled in a prospective study of 30 days duration, participating from their homes. Methods: In-depth hermeneutic interviews (2 per 15 participants) and self-assessment diaries recorded on electronic tablets (daily per 30 participants) were completed. Transcribed interviews and self-recorded survey data were analyzed using hermeneutical analysis and ecological momentary assessment and content analysis, respectively. Findings: Common reasons participants did not take medications as prescribed included tolerability, transportation, access to medications, and forgetting. The overarching pattern, “preserving self,” was supported by two patterns that subsumed several themes: (a) engaging the powerful hold of my illness, and (b) engaging providers in visioning health. Conclusions: A deeper understanding of the impact of receiving a new prescription and of managing medication reveals the challenges patients experience in preserving a sense of self. Healthcare providers of all disciplines should understand the meaning of medication prescribing and medication taking to ameliorate medication-taking difficulties.

The last comprehensive analysis of threats facing rare plants in the United States was conducted nearly 20 years ago. Here we systematically analyze the threats facing 2733 rare and vulnerable plants in the US using textual analysis of the most comprehensive database available. In the continental US plants are most commonly threatened by outdoor recreation (affecting 35% of species), especially from off-road vehicles (19%) and hiking and related activities (13%). The next-most common threats are from livestock (33%), residential development (28%), non-native invasives (27%), and roads (21%). In Hawaii invasives threaten 95% of species followed by increases in fire intensity/frequency (26%) then livestock (19%). Multivariate analyses indicate threats do not form distinct “syndromes” (clusters of threats) but rather a single “mega-syndrome” with high degrees of overlap between most threats. We also compared the prevalence of threats to the distribution of research effort. Nearly 75% of threats are understudied relative to their prevalence, including five of the six most common threats while a few rare threats (missing species like pollinators; pathogens; logging; climate-induced ecosystem movement; and crop-based agriculture) receive most of the attention. In comparison to a benchmark assessment from 1998 (Wilcove et al.

The SAMs of mannosides were prepared either pure or along with thiolated triethylene glycol (TEG) at different molar ratios (1:1, 1:2, 1:4, 1:9, and 1:19) to better understand and optimize the interaction conditions. The charge-transfer resistance of the [Fe(CN)6]3 −/4 − redox probe was compared before and after the interaction at different concentrations of Con A to determine the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) and limit of detection (LOD). Values of Kd were found in the nanomolar range showing multivalent interactions between mannosides and Con A, and LOD was found ranging from 4 to 13 nM depending on the type of mannoside SAM used. Analysis using the Hill equation suggests negative cooperativity in the binding behavior. Peanut agglutinin was used as a negative control, and cyclic voltammetry was used to further support the experiments. We have found that neither the pure nor the widely dispersed monolayers of mannosides provide the conditions for optimal binding of Con A.

The ability of contesting orientations to predict sportspersonship over and above autonomous and controlled motivations was also examined. Design Cross-sectional and correlational. Methods Five hundred and forty-four intercollegiate US athletes (57.2% male) from individual and team sports completed measures of contesting orientations, autonomous and controlled motivations, and sportspersonship. Results Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) supported the factorial validity of the COS, while correlational results supported its concurrent construct validity, with autonomous motivation associated with higher levels of partnership orientation and controlled motivation associated with higher levels of war orientation. In addition, sequential regression analyses supported the predictive utility of contesting orientations, with partnership orientation emerging as a significant positive predictor of four – and war orientation a negative predictor of three – dimensions of sportspersonship. Mediation analyses suggested that contesting orientations may partially mediate the relationship between autonomous and controlled motivations for some dimensions of sportspersonship. Conclusions The COS is a valid and reliable measure of contesting orientations. Partnership and war contesting orientations, moreover, add significantly to the prediction of sportspersonship over and above autonomous and controlled motivations. In practice, if the goal is to promote good sportspersonship, coaches and other adults involved in competitive sport should emphasize a partnership contesting orientation in addition to more autonomous forms of motivation.",,10.1016/j.psychsport.2016.08.005,,66,,,84981244695 (Scopus),14690292,,77,2016-11-01,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychsport.2016.08.005,Psychology of Sport and Exercise,27

Yet, do elected officials make it less difficult for some immigrants than others to secure employment in a state? Using U.S. temporary immigrant labor admissions data between 2006 and 2014, I examine the extent to which growth rates of main foreign-born subgroups influence E-Verify policies that require employers to authenticate the legal immigration status of employees. I find that state policymakers are less likely to enact E-Verify policies in response to the growth of immigrants who work in specialty occupations (H-1b visas). In contrast, the growth of immigrants working in nonspecialty occupations (H-2a and H-2b visas) increases the likelihood of enacting E-Verify policies over time. The results suggest that policymakers release strict rules for employment only for highly educated immigrants who work in specialty occupations that offer higher paying salaries and career advancement opportunities. Disaggregating a monolithic foreign-born population indicator into more specific class components provides an important contribution to public policy studies.

We demonstrate unprecedentedly feature-rich chromatograms are observed even with standard UV detection for polar NOM fractions. The second stage of fractionation is demonstrated to separate isomers, providing a direct look at isomeric complexity in NOM as well as a tool to reduce it. Consistent with expectation, but confirmed for the first time through mass spectral data, radicals were detected for NOM components that were generally nonpolar and grouped in the condensed aromatic structure – like region of van Krevelen plots. High-resolution tandem mass spectral data, furthermore, suggests that many higher-MW components of fulvic acids (especially the highly oxidized ones) have formulas that do not match any known compounds in the literature, supporting the hypothesis that fulvic acids are a unique compound-class.

With conventional edge-aware filters, it is often challenging to handle images of high complexity where features of multiple scales coexist. In particular, it is not always easy to find the right balance between removing unimportant details and protecting important features when they come in multiple sizes, shapes, and contrasts. Unlike previous approaches, we address this issue from the perspective of adaptive kernel scales. Relying on patch-based statistics, our method identifies texture from structure and also finds an optimal per-pixel smoothing scale.

We ask whether shorebirds remain infection-free when wintering in areas where parasite transmission occurs among landbird species. Blood samples were collected at three locations in Argentina: Patagonia, with an avian assemblage dominated by shorebird species; Mar Chiquita Lagoon, a high-salinity water basin where shorebird and landbird species co-occur; and inland sites in Chaco and Cordoba provinces, where host assemblages included mostly landbird species. We screened 650 samples for the presence of haemosporidian infections and sequenced a part of the parasite mitochondrial cytochrome b gene to determine parasite lineages.

Wintering location had no effect on the prevalence of haemosporidian parasites in shorebirds. Haemosporidian infections are rare in shorebirds even when these co-occur with landbird species in inland areas suitable for parasite transmission.

Abuse histories (physical, sexual, emotional) are prevalent in IBS. While abuse relates to mood disorders (depression and anxiety) also common in IBS, the influence of abuse on gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and its independence from psychological symptom comorbidity has not been studied. Methods: Consecutive GI outpatients completed the ROME III Research Diagnostic Questionnaire and questionnaires on trauma (Life-Stress Questionnaire), mood (Beck Depression/Anxiety Inventories), somatic symptoms (PHQ-12), and HRQOL (SF-36). Current GI symptom severity and bother were assessed using 10-cm Visual Analog Scales. Key Results: 272 ROME-defined IBS (47.6 ± 0.9 years, 81% female) and 246 non-FGID (51.6 ± 1.0 years, 65% female) subjects participated. IBS patients reported greater rates of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse (p < 0.006 each), and higher depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms (p < 0.001).

Abuse effects were additive, with greater IBS symptom severity and poorer HRQOL noted in cases with multiple forms of abuse. Mediation analyses suggested that abuse effects on GI symptoms and HRQOL were partially mediated by mood.

In previous research, smoking media literacy (SML) has been associated with these variables, even when controlling for other known risk factors for smoking. However, these studies were performed with older teenagers, often in high school, not younger teens at a crucial developmental point with respect to the decision to begin smoking. METHODS: This study uses survey data collected from 656 American public middle school students representing multiple zip codes, schools, and school districts. RESULTS: Smoking media literacy levels for middle school students were similar to those of high school students in earlier studies. Higher SML levels were associated with lower susceptibility to future smoking and predicted susceptibility to smoke when controlling for other risk factors. This suggests that the same relationships found with teenagers may exist with middle school students.

While there are numerous deleterious effects of Aβ accumulation, there is general agreement that a sustained inflammatory response to aggregated Aβ contributes to progressive neurodegeneration in AD and microglial cells play a significant role in this process. Our laboratory and others have shown that small soluble aggregates of Aβ activate a microglia-mediated inflammatory response. One component of the response involves internalization of extracellular Aβ, and this process is likely very sensitive to Aβ structure. In this study we analyzed the proclivity of microglia for internalization of Aβ42 monomers and protofibrils using fluorescently-labeled Aβ. Both Aβ42 species were labeled directly via amino linkage with an Alexa Fluor 488 tetrafluorophenyl ester (AF488-TFP) and then isolated individually by chromatography. Aβ42 protofibrils retained their size and morphological properties after labeling but monomers had a much higher stoichiometry of labeling compared to protofibrils. Primary murine microglia internalized AF488-Aβ42 protofibrils rapidly and in significant amounts compared to AF488-Aβ42 monomers. Microglial internalization of protofibrils was dependent on time and concentration, and corresponded with tumor necrosis factor α secretion. In competition studies, unlabeled Aβ42 protofibril internalization, detected by immunostaining, did not diminish AF488-protofibril uptake. Internalized AF488-Aβ42 protofibrils were found widely dispersed in the cytosol with some lysosomal accumulation but little degradation. These studies highlight the sensitivity that microglia exhibit to Aβ structure in the internalization process and emphasize their affinity for soluble Aβ protofibrils.",,10.1016/j.brainres.2016.08.016,18726240,485,National Institute on Aging,R15AG033913,84983401985 (Scopus),00068993,,495,2016-10-01,27531183.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2016.08.016,Brain Research,1648

To facilitate discussion on emerging and future directions in HAND research, a meeting was held in Durban, South Africa in March 2015 as part of the Society of Neuroscientists of Africa (SONA) conference. The objective of the meeting was to assess the impact of HIV subtype diversity on HAND and immunological dysfunction. The meeting brought together international leaders in the area of neurological complications of HIV-1 infection with special focus on the African population. Research presentations indicated that HAND was highly prevalent and that inflammatory cytokines and immune-activation played important roles in progression of neurocognitive impairment. Furthermore, children on antiretroviral therapy were also at risk for developing neurocognitive impairment. With respect to the effect of HIV-1 subtype diversity, analyses of HIV-1 clade C infection among South Africans revealed that clade C infection induced cognitive impairment that was independent of the substitution in HIV-1 Trans-Activator of Transcription (Tat; C31S). At the cellular level, a Zambian study showed that clade C infection resulted in reduced brain cell death compared with clade B infection suggesting clade specific variations in mediating brain cell injury.

We examined the growth rates of 554 stems found in 10 ha of the 50-ha Yasuní Forest Dynamics Plot. We explored whether palm growth responds to: (1) the size of individual palms; (2) light availability; or (3) the number of conspecifics and heterospecifics in the surrounding neighbourhood. Individual growth rates were positively related to palm height in the three life stages considered here (seedlings, saplings and adults). The mean annual diameter increment was higher (3.2 ± 4.6 mm year−1) in individuals with a diameter at breast height (DBH) of < 20 cm, and mean vertical elongation of juveniles (0.2 ± 0.2 m year−1) was initiated early in development until they became pre-adults. Growth in I. deltoidea was minimally affected by the presence of neighbours (basal area of conspecifics and heterospecifics), suggesting that this species can succeed at high densities with low levels of interspecific competition.

This study explores corruption in Kenya's HIV response system and the implications for health outcomes from the perspective of people living with HIV (PLHIV). Although they might not be directly responsible for health care fund management, PLHIV and their advocacy efforts have been central to the development of HIV system response and they have a vested interest in ensuring proper governance. Methods: This phenomenological study was conducted in 2012 in Kiambu County in Kenya. The study was designed to capture the experiences of a select group of individuals living with HIV and AIDS and subsequent effects on intergenerational wealth transmission. Four focus groups were conducted with self-convened HIV/AIDS peer support groups. Findings related to corruption emerged unexpectedly, albeit consistently, across all four focus groups. To validate core themes within the data, including corruption, two coders independently reviewed and coded the data. Results: Participants described incidences of resource misallocation, theft, and denial of services across three thematic levels namely at the interpersonal, provider, and institutional levels. Participants described the negative influence of corruption on their health and financial well-being, and propose: (1) strengthening legal protections for assets belonging to PLHIV, (2) direct representation of PLHIV within service agencies, (3) and addressing information asymmetries to inject transparency into the response system. Conclusion: Our findings add to the growing literature that identifies advocacy among individuals and families impacted by HIV and AIDS to be a useful tool in drawing attention to harmful practices in the HIV response infrastructure; consistent with this movement, communities in Kenya demand greater control over programmatic interventions both at the national and local levels.",468,10.1186/s12913-016-1721-y,14726963,,Adelphi University,,84984871143 (Scopus),,1,,2016-09-05,27595765.0,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-016-1721-y,BMC Health Services Research,16

We incorporated host phylogenetic relationship and relative abundance in assessing parasite specialization, and we examined associations between parasite specialization and three host characteristics - abundance, mass and longevity - using quantile regression, phylogenetic logistic regression and t-tests. Hosts of specialist malaria parasite lineages were on average more abundant than hosts of generalist parasite lineages, but the relationship between host abundance and parasite specialization was not consistent across analyses. We also found support for a positive association between parasite specialization and host longevity, but this also was not consistent across analyses. Nonetheless, our findings suggest that the predictability of a host resource may play a role in the evolution of specialization. However, we also discuss two alternative explanations to the resource predictability hypothesis for specialization: (i) that interspecific interactions among the parasites themselves might constrain some parasites to a specialist strategy, and (ii) that frequent encounters with multiple host species, mediated by blood-sucking insects, might promote generalization within this system.",,10.1111/mec.13758,1365294X,4377,,,85027928976 (Scopus),,17,4391,2016-09-01,27411062.0,https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.13758,Molecular ecology,25

One-dimensional movement metrics scale consistently with body size yet vary over different temporal scales. Knowing how temporal scale influences the relationship between animal body size and movement would better inform hypotheses about the efficiency of foraging behaviour, the ontogeny of energy budgets, and numerous life-history trade-offs. We investigated how the temporal scaling of allometric patterns in movement varies over the course of a year, specifically during periods of motivated (directional and fast movement) and unmotivated (stationary and tortuous movement) behaviour. We focused on a recently diverged group of species that displays wide variation in movement behaviour - giant Galapagos tortoises (Chelonoidis spp.) - to test how movement metrics estimated on a monthly basis scaled with body size. We used state-space modelling to estimate seven different movement metrics of Galapagos tortoises. We used log-log regression of the power law to evaluate allometric scaling for these movement metrics and contrasted relationships by species and sex. Allometric scaling of movement was more apparent during motivated periods of movement. During this period, allometry was revealed at multiple temporal intervals (hourly, daily and monthly), with values observed at daily and monthly intervals corresponding most closely to the expected one-fourth scaling coefficient, albeit with wide credible intervals. We further detected differences in the magnitude of scaling among taxa uncoupled from observed differences in the temporal structuring of their movement rates. Our results indicate that the definition of temporal scales is fundamental to the detection of allometry of movement and should be given more attention in movement studies. Our approach not only provides new conceptual insights into temporal attributes in one-dimensional scaling of movement, but also generates valuable insights into the movement ecology of iconic yet poorly understood Galapagos giant tortoises.",,10.1111/1365-2656.12561,13652656,1171,National Science Foundation,DBI-1003221,85027918196 (Scopus),,5,1181,2016-09-01,27336221.0,https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12561,Journal of Animal Ecology,85

Here by studying 40000 ferromagnetic spins, we show that it is the optical spin-orbit torque that determines the course of spin switching in both ferromagnets and ferrimagnets. Spin switching occurs only if the effective spin angular momentum of each constituent in an alloy exceeds a critical value. Because of the strong exchange coupling, the spin switches much faster in ferromagnets than weakly coupled ferrimagnets. This establishes a paradigm for all-optical spin switching.

Using an engineered bacterial consortium, we repeatedly evolved cooperative genotypes and examined both the predictability of evolution and the phenotypes that determine community dynamics. Eight Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strains evolved methionine excretion sufficient to support growth of an Escherichia coli methionine auxotroph, from whom they required excreted growth substrates. Non-synonymous mutations in metA, encoding homoserine trans-succinylase (HTS), were detected in each evolved S. enterica methionine cooperator and were shown to be necessary for cooperative consortia growth. Molecular modeling was used to predict that most of the non-synonymous mutations slightly increase the binding affinity for HTS homodimer formation. Despite this genetic parallelism and trend of increasing protein binding stability, these metA alleles gave rise to a wide range of phenotypic diversity in terms of individual versus group benefit. The cooperators with the highest methionine excretion permitted nearly two-fold faster consortia growth and supported the highest fraction of E. coli, yet also had the slowest individual growth rates compared to less cooperative strains. Thus, although the genetic basis of adaptation was quite similar across independent origins of cooperative phenotypes, quantitative measurements of metabolite production were required to predict either the individual-level growth consequences or how these propagate to community-level behavior.",e0161837,10.1371/journal.pone.0161837,19326203,,National Institutes of Health,DE-SC0006731,84990945017 (Scopus),,9,,2016-09-01,27617746.0,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0161837,PLoS ONE,11

To clarify this issue, a task consisting of several runs was designed to combine a modified version of the reward-priming paradigm with an unconscious version of the Go/No-Go task. At the beginning of each run, participants were exposed to a high- or low-value coin, followed by the modified Go/No-Go task.

Methods: Data were drawn from a same-sex female twin study of substance use (n = 3521; 14.3% African-American). Cox proportional hazards regression analyses using CSA to predict smoking initiation and progression to regular smoking were conducted separately by race/ethnicity. Co-twin status on the smoking outcome was used to adjust for familial influences on smoking (which may overlap with family-level influences on CSA exposure). Results: After adjusting for co-twin status, CSA was associated with smoking initiation in European Americans (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.43, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.26-1.62) and with smoking initiation ≤. 16 in African Americans (HR = 1.70, CI: 1.26-2.29).

Logistic and negative binomial regression models are estimated to assess whether there are significant differences in offending prevalence and incidence during the 1990s. Results: The reduction in property crime rates in the PYS sample during the 1990s can be attributed to declines in both offending prevalence and incidence. The overall decline in serious violence during the 1990s for the full sample was primarily the result of a falloff in prevalence. However, for black youth our results indicate significant reductions in both the prevalence and incidence of serious violence. We did not detect a significant difference in illegal drug sales during the period. Conclusions: Using longitudinal data on individuals to decompose aggregate crime trends into changes in the prevalence and incidence of offending offers insights into the nature of the 1990s crime drop that cannot be discerned from aggregate crime data.

We argue that price inflation increases the rate of crimes committed for monetary gain by fueling demand for cheap stolen goods.

Both short- and long-run effects of the predictors are estimated. Results: Among the economic indicators, only inflation has consistent and robust short- and long-run effects on year-over-year change in the offense types under consideration. Low inflation helps to explain why acquisitive crime did not increase during the 2008–2009 recession. Imprisonment rates also have robust long-run effects on change in acquisitive crime rates.

The relationships between UCR and NCVS trends in violence and six factors from prior research are estimated to illustrate the impact of data choice on findings about potential sources of changes in crime over time. Methods: Crime-specific data from the UCR and NCVS for the period 1973–2012 are compared to each other using a variety of correlational techniques to assess correspondence in the trends, and to UCR homicide data which have been shown to be externally valid in comparison with other mortality records. Log-level trend correlations are used to describe the associations between trends in violence, homicide and the potential explanatory factors. Results: Although long-term trends in robbery, burglary and motor vehicle theft in the UCR and NCVS are similar, this is not the case for rape, aggravated assault, or a summary measure of serious violence. NCVS trends in serious violence are more highly correlated with homicide data than are UCR trends suggesting that the NCVS is a more valid indicator of long-term trends in violence for crimes other than robbery. This is largely due to differences during the early part of the time series for aggravated assault and rape when the UCR data exhibited consistent increases in the rates in contrast to general declines in the NCVS. Choice of data does affect conclusions about the relationships between hypothesized explanatory factors and serious violence. Most notably, the reported association between trends in levels of gasoline lead exposure and serious violence is likely to be an artifact associated with the reliance on UCR data, as it is not found when NCVS or homicide trend data are used. Conclusions: The weight of the evidence suggests that NCVS data represent more valid indicators of the trends in rape, aggravated assault and serious violence from 1973 to the mid-1980s. Studies of national trends in serious violence that include the 1973 to mid-1980s period should rely on NCVS and homicide data for analyses of the covariates of violent crime trends.",,10.1007/s10940-015-9277-2,,335,,,84952015007 (Scopus),07484518,3,355,2016-09-01,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10940-015-9277-2,Journal of Quantitative Criminology,32

Although fibrillar amyloidβ (Aβ)-stimulated cytokine secretion from both wild-type and APP knock-out (mAPP-/-) microglial cultures, oligomeric Aβ was unable to stimulate increased secretion from mAPP-/- cells.

Little is known about the neural correlates of rumination in women with PTSD. The current study utilized functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine neural correlates during an emotion interference task of self-reported rumination in women with PTSD. Women with PTSD (39 participants) were recruited at a university-based trauma clinic and completed a clinical evaluation that included measures of PTSD symptoms, rumination, and depressive symptoms, as well as a neuroimaging session in which the participants were administered an emotion interference task.

This dynamical phenomenon has recently been studied in computational models and demonstrated experimentally in mechanical, optical, and chemical systems. The theoretical basis of these states is currently under active investigation. Chimera behavior is of particular relevance in the context of neural synchronization, given the phenomenon of unihemispheric sleep and the recent observation of asymmetric sleep in human patients with sleep apnea. The similarity of neural chimera states to neural ""bump"" states, which have been suggested as a model for working memory and visual orientation tuning in the cortex, adds to their interest as objects of study.

Yet, prior scholarship has suggested that prohibition reduces illicit drug sellers’ access to law and thereby increases predation against and retaliation by them. No prior study, however, has directly tested that theory by comparing drug sellers of different legal statuses operating in a single place and time. This study analyzes rates of victimization, legal mobilization, and violent retaliation in three retail drug markets in Amsterdam, the Netherlands: the legally regulated alcohol trade of cafés, the decriminalized cannabis market of “coffeeshops,” and the illegal street drug market. Results from interviews conducted with 50 sellers in each market indicate, as expected, that illicit drug dealers have the highest rates of victimization and violent retaliation and the lowest rates of legal mobilization. Contrary to expectations, we find coffeeshops experience less victimization than cafés and have similar rates of violent retaliation and legal mobilization. Policy Implications: Our findings suggest that state regulation of drug markets affects victimization and conflict management of sellers, but the relationship does not seem to be linear. Prohibition undercuts the state's regulatory capacity by producing zones of virtual statelessness in which formal means of dispute resolution are unavailable, and thus, victimization and retaliation are more common. At the other extreme is laissez faire regulation, which may make sellers more likely to address problems only after they occur (instead of preventing their occurrence). The Dutch government originally instituted coffeeshops as a harm-reduction method meant to separate the market for cannabis from that of hard drugs. The policy also seems to work well when it comes to reducing victimization, perhaps by encouraging the use of preventive measures by coffeeshop owners and employees. The Dutch experience offers lessons for drug policy reforms elsewhere.",,10.1111/1745-9133.12218,17459133,843,,,84983490358 (Scopus),15386473,3,875,2016-08-01,,https://doi.org/10.1111/1745-9133.12218,Criminology and Public Policy,15

Methods: We investigate how marriage promotes desistance from crime among urban African American males raised in the Woodlawn community, a disadvantaged neighborhood in Chicago.

Further, we test if the process of desistance is conditional upon contextual disadvantage. Results: While initial findings show an increase in violent and property offending upon divorce, further analysis shows evidence that this effect differs by neighborhood structural context; the increase in offending upon divorce is apparent only for African American men who experience continued disadvantage across the life course. Those who moved to relatively more advantaged areas by adulthood show no increase in offending upon marital dissolution.

Net of controls, both maternal and paternal incarceration significantly increase log odds of adult offspring CJS involvement. This effect is especially pronounced for same-sex parent–child dyads, suggesting that the salience of parental incarceration for adult offending outcomes is gendered.

We present an integer programming (IP) model developed for matching successive events in such situations and illustrate its application in three problem settings involving (a) airline operations at an airport, (b) taxi service between an airport and a train station, and (c) taxi services from an airport. With data from the third setting (where a matching key was available), we illustrate the robustness of estimates for median and mean times between events under different random rates for “failure to record”, different screening criteria for outliers, and different target times used in the IP objective.

G., Koeller, K. J., Slomczynska, U., Fok, K., Helmus, M., Bashkin, J. K., Fisher, C., Antiviral Res. 91 (2011) 177-186). Described here are the interactions of these PAs with sequences in the long control region (LCR) of HPV16 (7348-122). Using an FeEDTA conjugate of PA1 (designed to recognize 5′-W2GW7-3′; W = A or T), 34 affinity cleavage (AC) patterns were detected for this fragment. These sites can be rationalized with sequences featuring perfect, single, double, triple and quadruple mismatches. Quantitative DNase I footprinting analysis indicates that perfect sites bind PA1 with Kds between 0.7 and 2.2 nM. Kds for single, double, triple and quadruple mismatch sites range from 1-3 nM-20 nM. Using AC and EDTA conjugates, we report that unlike smaller 8-ring hairpin PAs, introduction of a chiral turn in this large polyamide has no effect on binding orientation (forward vs. reverse). Despite its design to recognize 5′-W2GW5GW4-3′ via two Im residues, a motif not represented in this HPV sequence, a PA25-EDTA conjugate yielded 31 affinity cleavage sites on the region. Low nM Kds for PA25 without EDTA indicates a high tolerance for triple and quadruple mismatches. While there is extensive coverage of the sequence examined, AC cleavage patterns for the two PAs show discrete binding events and do not overlap significantly. This indicates that within the context of A/T rich sequences, these PAs do not recognize a simple shared sequence-related feature of the DNA.

For plant–herbivore interactions, it has been hypothesized that when plant species diversity is reduced, loss of plant biomass to herbivores increases. Although long-standing, this hypothesis has received mixed support. Increasing plant chemical diversity with increasing plant taxonomic diversity is likely to be important for plant–herbivore interactions at the community level, but the role of chemical diversity is unexplored. Here we assess the effect of volatile chemical diversity on patterns of herbivore damage in naturally occurring patches of Piper (Piperaceae) shrubs in a Costa Rican lowland wet forest. Volatile chemical diversity negatively affected total, specialist, and generalist herbivore damage. Furthermore, there were differences between the effects of high-volatility and low-volatility chemical diversity on herbivore damage. High-volatility diversity reduced specialist herbivory, while low-volatility diversity reduced generalist herbivory. Our data suggest that, although increased plant diversity is expected to reduce average herbivore damage, this pattern is likely mediated by the diversity of defensive compounds and general classes of anti-herbivore traits, as well as the degree of specialization of the herbivores attacking those plants.",,10.1007/s00442-016-3629-y,,1199,National Science Foundation,DEB-1210643,84964596814 (Scopus),00298549,4,1208,2016-08-01,27129320.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00442-016-3629-y,Oecologia,181

By conducting a systematic literature review, prior research was examined to see whether perceptions of procedural justice and police performance result in higher levels of perceived legitimacy of the police institution, and in turn whether this perceived legitimacy stimulates cooperative behavior among crime victims specifically. Results of the 15 included studies indicate that partial support for the applicability of this framework on crime victims was found. However, none of the included studies tested all relationships within the framework simultaneously among crime victims; they typically focused only on one of the interrelationships between the frameworks’ key concepts.

Stationary-phase mutagenesis in stressed bacillus subtilis cells operates by Mfd-dependent mutagenic pathways,OA,Gold OA,-,-,Green Final OA,-,https://doi.org/10.3390/genes7070033,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84978775566,"Mfd, MutY, NER, PolI, Transcription-mediated mutagenesis","In replication-limited cells of Bacillus subtilis, Mfd is mutagenic at highly transcribed regions, even in the absence of bulky DNA lesions. However, the mechanism leading to increased mutagenesis through Mfd remains currently unknown. Here, we report that Mfd may promote mutagenesis in nutritionally stressed B. subtilis cells by coordinating error-prone repair events mediated by UvrA, MutY and PolI. Using a point-mutated gene conferring leucine auxotrophy as a genetic marker, it was found that the absence of UvrA reduced the Leu+ revertants and that a second mutation in mfd reduced mutagenesis further. Moreover, the mfd and polA mutants presented low but similar reversion frequencies compared to the parental strain. These results suggest that Mfd promotes mutagenic events that required the participation of NER pathway and PolI. Remarkably, this Mfd-dependent mutagenic pathway was found to be epistatic onto MutY; however, whereas the MutY-dependent Leu+ reversions required Mfd, a direct interaction between these proteins was not apparent. In summary, our results support the concept that Mfd promotes mutagenesis in starved B. subtilis cells by coordinating both known and previously unknown Mfd-associated repair pathways.

Forest restoration treatments have subtle long-term effects on soil C and N cycling in mixed conifer forests,-,-,-,-,-,-,,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84977646788,"Biogeochemistry, Fire suppression, Forest restoration, Nutrient cycling, Pinus ponderosa, Prescribed fire, Thinning","Decades of fire suppression following extensive timber harvesting have left much of the forest in the intermountain western United States exceedingly dense, and forest restoration techniques (i.e., thinning and prescribed fire) are increasingly being used in an attempt to mitigate the effects of severe wildfire, to enhance tree growth and regeneration, and to stimulate soil nutrient cycling. While many of the short-term effects of forest restoration have been established, the long-term effects on soil biogeochemical and ecosystem processes are largely unknown. We assessed the effects of commonly used forest restoration treatments (thinning, burning, and thinning + burning) on nutrient cycling and other ecosystem processes 11 yr after restoration treatments were implemented in a ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa var. scopulorum)/Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca) forest at the Lubrecht Fire and Fire Surrogates Study (FFS) site in western Montana, USA. Despite short-term (<3 yr) increases in soil inorganic nitrogen (N) pools and N cycling rates following prescribed fire, long-term soil N pools and N mineralization rates showed only subtle differences from untreated control plots. Similarly, despite a persistent positive correlation between fuels consumed in prescribed burns and several metrics of N cycling, variability in inorganic N pools decreased significantly since treatments were implemented, indicating a decline in N spatial heterogeneity through time. However, rates of net nitrification remain significantly higher in a thin + burn treatment relative to other treatments. Short-term declines in forest floor carbon (C) pools have persisted in the thin + burn treatment, but there were no significant long-term differences among treatments in extractable soil phosphorus (P). Finally, despite some short-term differences, long-term foliar nutrient concentrations, litter decomposition rates, and rates of free-living N fixation in the experimental plots were not different from control plots, suggesting nutrient cycles and ecosystem processes in temperate coniferous forests are resilient to disturbance following long periods of fire suppression. Overall, this study provides forest managers and policymakers valuable information showing that the effects of these commonly used restoration prescriptions on soil nutrient cycling are ephemeral and that use of repeated treatments (i.e., frequent fire) will be necessary to ensure continued restoration success.",,,19395582,1503,U.S. Department of Agriculture,229018,84977646788 (Scopus),,5,1516,2016-07-01,27755759.0,,Ecological Applications,26

With the increasing availability of data on distributions and phylogenetic relationships and new analytical approaches to understanding the processes that shape species distributions and interactions, a re-evaluation of this ever-interesting topic is timely. Location: Islands globally. Methods: We start by arguing that the reasons why island research has achieved so much in the past also apply to the future. We then critically assess the current state of island biogeography, focusing on recent changes in emphasis, including research featured in this special issue of Global Ecology and Biogeography. Finally, we suggest promising themes for the future. We cover both ecological and evolutionary topics, although the greater emphasis on island ecology reflects our own backgrounds and interests. Results: Much ecological theory has been directly or indirectly influenced by research on island biotas. Currently, island biogeography is renascent, with research focusing on, among other things, patterns and processes underlying species interaction networks, species coexistence and the assembly of island communities through ecological and evolutionary time. Continuing island research should provide additional insight into biological invasions and other impacts of human activities, functional diversity and ecosystem functioning, extinction and diversification, species pools and more. Deeper understanding of the similarities and differences between island and mainland systems will aid transferability of island theory to continental regions. Main conclusions: As research in biogeography and related fields expands in new directions, islands continue to provide opportunities for developing insights, both as natural laboratories for ecology and evolution and because of the exceptions islands often present to the usual ‘rules’ of ecology. New data collection initiatives are needed on islands world-wide and should be directed towards filling gaps in our knowledge of within-island distributions of species, as well as the functional traits and phylogenetic relationships of island species.",,10.1111/geb.12477,14668238,751,Seventh Framework Programme,331623,84975117334 (Scopus),1466822X,7,768,2016-07-01,,https://doi.org/10.1111/geb.12477,Global Ecology and Biogeography,25

We asked whether tree planting for ecological restoration accelerates epiphyte community recovery. Does the spatial configuration of tree planting matter? What landscape contexts are most suitable for epiphyte restoration?. Location: Restored pastures in premontane Coto Brus County, Puntarenas, Costa Rica. Methods: We surveyed vascular epiphyte species growing on the lower trunks of 1083 trees in 13 experimental restoration sites. Each site contained three 0.25-ha treatment plots: natural regeneration, trees planted in patches or ‘islands’ and tree plantations. Sites spanned elevational (1100–1430 m) and deforestation (4–94% forest cover within a 100-m radius around each site) gradients. Results: Vascular epiphytes were twice as diverse in planted restoration plots (islands and plantations) as in natural regeneration; we observed this at the scale of individual host trees and within 0.25-ha treatment plots. Contributing factors included that trees in planted restoration plots were larger, older, more abundant and composed of different species than trees in naturally regenerating plots. Epiphyte species richness increased with surrounding forest cover within 100–150 m of restoration plots. Epiphyte communities were also twice as diverse at higher (1330–1430 m) vs lower (1100–1290 m) elevation sites. Epiphyte groups responded differently to restoration treatments and landscape factors; ferns were responsible for higher species richness in planted restoration plots, whereas angiosperms drove elevation and forest cover effects. Conclusions: Tree planting for ecological restoration enriched epiphyte communities compared to natural regeneration, likely because planted forests contained more, bigger and older trees. Tree island plantings were equally effective compared to larger and more expensive plantations. Restoration sites nearer to existing forests had richer epiphyte recolonization, likely because nearby forests provisioned restoration sites with angiosperm seeds. Collectively, results suggest that restoration practitioners can enrich epiphyte community development by planting trees in areas with higher surrounding forest cover, particularly at higher elevations.",,10.1111/avsc.12234,1654109X,508,National Science Foundation,1456520,84971612096 (Scopus),14022001,3,517,2016-07-01,,https://doi.org/10.1111/avsc.12234,Applied Vegetation Science,19

In this study, an immortalized rat astrocyte (DI TNC1) cell line expressing a luciferase reporter driven by the NF-κB or the Nrf2/Antioxidant Response Element (ARE) promoter was used to assess regulation of these two pathways by phytochemicals such as quercetin, rutin, cyanidin, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, as well as botanical extracts from Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha), Sutherlandia frutescens (Sutherlandia) and Euterpe oleracea (Açaí).

Location: Thirteen islands in the Lesser Antilles, from Grenada in the south to St Kitts in the north. Methods: Birds were captured by mist net and small blood samples were taken for polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing analysis of haemosporidian parasite infections. Similarities between islands with respect to geographical distance, avian host assemblages and haemosporidian parasite assemblages were compared by partial Mantel tests. Relative abundances of avian host populations across islands were compared to the relative abundances of common haemosporidian lineages by stepwise regression. Results: Populations of parasite lineages were more heterogeneously distributed than were host populations across the islands; parasite lineages frequently shift between hosts on different islands and exhibit range disjunctions. Relative population sizes of two widespread and common species of bird in the Lesser Antilles, the bananaquit Coereba flaveola and the black-faced grassquit Tiaris bicolor, were negatively related to the relative abundances of two parasite lineages, OZ01 (Plasmodium sp.) and OZ12 (Haemoproteus sp.), although the latter parasite was not recovered from either host. Positive associations between populations of Elaenia martinica and the relative abundance of three parasite lineages in populations of Vireo altiloquus additionally suggest the possibility of apparent competition between avian species mediated through haemosporidian parasites. Main conclusions: The results of these analyses are consistent with a strong influence of some avian haemosporidian parasites on populations of their hosts, including indirect interactions through apparent competition. In addition, the heterogeneity of host–parasite associations between islands suggests an evolutionarily dynamic system that is consistent with phases of host expansion and contraction, commonly known as the taxon cycle.",,10.1111/jbi.12730,13652699,1277,National Science Foundation,,84958260446 (Scopus),03050270,7,1286,2016-07-01,,https://doi.org/10.1111/jbi.12730,Journal of Biogeography,43
Dimensional depression severity in women with major depression and post-traumatic stress disorder correlates with fronto-amygdalar hypoconnectivty,OA,-,-,-,-,Green Accepted OA,https://doi.org/10.1038/mp.2015.149,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84942546479,,"Depressive symptoms are common in multiple psychiatric disorders and are frequent sequelae of trauma. A dimensional conceptualization of depression suggests that symptoms should be associated with a continuum of deficits in specific neural circuits. However, most prior investigations of abnormalities in functional connectivity have typically focused on a single diagnostic category using hypothesis-driven seed-based analyses. Here, using a sample of 105 adult female participants from three diagnostic groups (healthy controls, n=17; major depression, n=38; and post-traumatic stress disorder, n=50), we examine the dimensional relationship between resting-state functional dysconnectivity and severity of depressive symptoms across diagnostic categories using a data-driven analysis (multivariate distance-based matrix regression). This connectome-wide analysis identified foci of dysconnectivity associated with depression severity in the bilateral amygdala. Follow-up seed analyses using subject-specific amygdala segmentations revealed that depression severity was associated with amygdalo-frontal hypo-connectivity in a network of regions including bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate and anterior insula. In contrast, anxiety was associated with elevated connectivity between the amygdala and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Taken together, these results emphasize the centrality of the amygdala in the pathophysiology of depressive symptoms, and suggest that dissociable patterns of amygdalo-frontal dysconnectivity are a critical neurobiological feature across clinical diagnostic categories.",,10.1038/mp.2015.149,14765578,894,National Institute of Mental Health,K23MH098130,84942546479 (Scopus),13594184,7,902,2016-07-01,26416545.0,https://doi.org/10.1038/mp.2015.149,Molecular Psychiatry,21

Recent studies have attempted to alter these properties through confinement of complex hydrides in nanoporous substrates. For example, LiBH4 may be melt-infiltrated into a nanoporous carbon (LiBH4@NPC), where electron-withdrawing boron concomitantly incorporates into the substrate, facilitating the wetting of the pores with molten LiBH4. We present results of the surface functionality displayed by incorporation of electron-donating nitrogen into a nanoporous carbon. The presence of pyridinic nitrogen in the substrate, confirmed by XPS analysis, acts as a Lewis base. Our results indicate partial decomposition on melt-infiltration of LiBH4 may produce electron-accepting BH3 defects at the surface of the hydride forming a stabilizing capping layer. Isothermal hydrogen desorption measurements indicate an activation energy increase of greater than 30 kJ/mol for LiBH4 confined in N-doped versus undoped substrates. Further, temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) measurements show a temperature increase of over 25 °C in the diborane (B2H6) signature, marking the beginning of the dehydriding reaction.

METHODS: The study was a mixed methods retrospective study of consultation summaries and hospital and ethics center data on 56 age-and gender-matched Caucasian and African American Medicare patients who received ethics consultations related to issues around limiting medical treatment in the period 2011 to 2014. The average age of patients was 70.9. RESULTS: Consultation requests for females were made significantly earlier in their stays in the hospital (6.57 days) than were consultation requests made for males (16.07 days). For African American patients, the differences in admission-to-request intervals for female patients (5.93 days) and male patients (18.64 days) were greater than for Caucasian male and female patients. Differences in the timing of a consultation were not significantly correlated with the presence of an advance directive, the specialty of the attending physician, or the reasons for the consult request. Ethics consultants may have mitigated problems that developed during the lag in request times for African American males by spending more time, on average, on those consultations (316 minutes), especially more time, on average, than on consultations with Caucasian females (195 minutes). Most consultations (40 of 56) did result in movement toward limiting treatment, but no statistically significant differences were found among the groups studied in the movement toward limiting treatment. The average number of days from consult to discharge or death were strongly correlated with the intervals between admission to the hospital and request for an ethics consultation.

The AZ forms in different tissues in different species of plants, but whether the AZ is developmentally similar wherever it occurs is unknown. AZ development in Setariaviridis was studied as a representative of the previously uncharacterized subfamily Panicoideae. METHODS: One accession of the wild species S. viridis and two of its domesticate, S. italica, were studied. Strength of the AZ was measured with a force gauge. Anatomy of the AZ was studied throughout development using bright field and confocal microscopy. KEY RESULTS: The force required to remove a spikelet of S. viridis from the parent plant dropped steadily during development, whereas that required to remove spikelets of S. italica increased initially before stabilizing at a high level. Despite the clear difference in tensile strength of the AZ, anatomical differences between S. viridis and S. italica were subtle, and the position of the AZ was not easy to determine in cross sections of pedicel apices. Staining with DAPI showed that nuclei were present up to and presumably through abscission in S. viridis, and acridine orange staining showed much less lignification than in other cereals.

For females, early SES affected first-grade maladaptation and low school bonds, which then predicted later drug use.",,10.1177/0022146516646808,21506000,223,National Institute on Drug Abuse,R01DA026863,84974589218 (Scopus),00221465,2,239,2016-06-01,27284077.0,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022146516646808,Journal of Health and Social Behavior,57

The heterocyst-specific nitrogenase encoded by the large nif1 gene cluster and the similar nif2 gene cluster that functions under anaerobic conditions in vegetative cells are under the control of the promoter for the first gene of each cluster, nifB1 or nifB2 respectively. Associated with each of these clusters is a putative regulatory gene called cnfR (patB) whose product has a C-terminal HTH domain and an N-terminal ferredoxin-like domain. CnfR1 activates nifB1 expression in heterocysts, while CnfR2 activates nifB2 expression. A cnfR1 mutant was unable to make nitrogenase under aerobic conditions in heterocysts while the cnfR2 mutant was unable to make nitrogenase under anaerobic conditions. Mutations in cnfR1 and cnfR2 reduced transcripts for the nif1 and nif2 genes respectively. The closely related cyanobacterium, Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 has the nif1 system but lacks nif2. Expression of nifB2:lacZ from A. variabilis in anaerobic vegetative cells of Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 depended on the presence of cnfR2.

The semi-empirical HGM consists of atom-centered spherical Gaussian functions and discrete point charges, which are optimized to reproduce the electrostatic potential on the molecular surface as well as the number of electrons in atom-centered and certain off-atom-centered spherical regions as closely as possible. In contrast, our previous Gaussian charge distribution model [J. Chem.

Objectives This study aimed to explore QOL in an international sample of adults with congenital heart disease (CHD), the association between patient characteristics and QOL, and international variation in QOL and its relationship to country-specific characteristics. Methods We enrolled 4,028 adults with CHD from 15 countries. QOL was assessed using a linear analog scale (LAS) (0 to 100) and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) (5 to 35). Patient characteristics included sex, age, marital status, educational level, employment status, CHD complexity, and patient-reported New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class. Country-specific characteristics included general happiness and 6 cultural dimensions. Linear mixed models were applied. Results Median QOL was 80 on the LAS and 27 on the SWLS. Older age, lack of employment, no marriage history, and worse NYHA functional class were associated with lower QOL (p < 0.001). Patients from Australia had the highest QOL (LAS: 82) and patients from Japan the lowest (LAS: 72). Happiness scores and cultural dimensions were not associated with variation in QOL after adjustment for patient characteristics and explained only an additional 0.1% of the variance above and beyond patient characteristics (p = 0.56). Conclusions This large-scale, international study found that overall QOL in adults with CHD was generally good. Variation in QOL was related to patient characteristics but not country-specific characteristics. Hence, patients at risk for poorer QOL can be identified using uniform criteria.

Rev. Lett. 90 247201) reported that when ferromagnetic nickel is subject to an intense ultrashort laser pulse, its exchange splitting is reduced quickly. But to simulate such reduction remains a big challenge. The popular rigid band approximation (RBA), where both the band structure and the exchange splitting are held fixed before and after laser excitation, is unsuitable for this purpose, while the time-dependent density functional theory could be time-consuming. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a time-dependent Liouville and density functional theory (TDLDFT) that integrates the time-dependent Liouville equation into the density functional theory. As a result, the excited charge density is reiterated back into the Kohn-Sham equation, and the band structure is allowed to change dynamically. Even with the ground-state density functional, a larger demagnetization than RBA is found; after we expand Ortenzi's spin scaling method into an excited-state (laser) density functional, we find that the exchange splitting is indeed strongly reduced, as seen in the experiment. Both the majority and minority bands are shifted toward the Fermi level, but the majority shifts a lot more. The ultrafast reduction in exchange splitting occurs concomitantly with demagnetization. While our current theory is still unable to yield the same percentage loss in the spin moment as observed in the experiment, it predicts a correct trend that agrees with the experiments. With a better functional, we believe that our results can be further improved.",236004,10.1088/0953-8984/28/23/236004,1361648X,,U.S. Department of Energy,DE-AC02-05CH11231,84969651526 (Scopus),09538984,23,,2016-05-10,,https://doi.org/10.1088/0953-8984/28/23/236004,Journal of Physics Condensed Matter,28

Moreover, animals adjust use of social versus personal information appropriately under a variety of experimental conditions [2-5]. An important factor in how information is used is the information's reliability, that is, how consistently the information is correlated with something of relevance in the environment [6]. The reliability of information determines which signals should be attended to during communication [6-9], which types of stimuli animals should learn about, and even whether learning should evolve [10, 11]. Here, we show that bumble bees (Bombus impatiens) account for the reliability of personally acquired information (which flower color was previously associated with reward) and social information (which flowers are chosen by other bees) in making foraging decisions; however, the two types of information are not treated equally. Bees prefer to use social information if it predicts a reward at all, but if social information becomes entirely unreliable, flower color will be used instead. This greater sensitivity to the reliability of social information, and avoidance of conspecifics in some cases, may reflect the specific ecological circumstances of bee foraging. Overall, the bees' ability to make decisions based on both personally acquired and socially derived information, and the relative reliability of both, demonstrates a new level of sophistication and flexibility in animal, particularly insect, decision-making.",,10.1016/j.cub.2016.03.009,,1195,National Science Foundation,IOS 0921280,84964596768 (Scopus),09609822,9,1199,2016-05-09,27133871.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2016.03.009,Current Biology,26

However, few studies have delineated the 2 forms of stigma (self-stigma and public stigma), and none have differentiated between stigma and career-related consequences (career worry). The aim of this study was to increase our understanding of low treatment-seeking rates among soldiers and veterans by expanding upon previous measurements of the stigma construct and examining factors influencing willingness to seek treatment. Method: The sample consisted of 276 Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) soldiers and veterans. Individual levels of self-stigma, public stigma, and career worry were measured, as were levels of willingness to seek treatment. Symptoms of PTSD, depression, and substance abuse were also evaluated to account for the influence of mental illness on treatment-seeking. Results: A confirmatory factor analysis indicated that a 3-factor model including self-stigma, public stigma, and career worry fit the data significantly better than a 1-or 2-factor model. A multiple regression analysis also revealed that these 3 factors, combined with mental illness symptomatology, significantly predicted individual levels of willingness to seek treatment. Career worry was the strongest predictor, particularly for individuals with no treatment history.

Several new orders are recognized: Boraginales, Dilleniales, Icacinales, Metteniusiales and Vahliales. This brings the total number of orders and families recognized in the APG system to 64 and 416, respectively. We propose two additional informal major clades, superrosids and superasterids, that each comprise the additional orders that are included in the larger clades dominated by the rosids and asterids. Families that made up potentially monofamilial orders, Dasypogonaceae and Sabiaceae, are instead referred to Arecales and Proteales, respectively. Two parasitic families formerly of uncertain positions are now placed: Cynomoriaceae in Saxifragales and Apodanthaceae in Cucurbitales. Although there is evidence that some families recognized in APG III are not monophyletic, we make no changes in Dioscoreales and Santalales relative to APG III and leave some genera in Lamiales unplaced (e.g. Peltanthera). These changes in familial circumscription and recognition have all resulted from new results published since APG III, except for some changes simply due to nomenclatural issues, which include substituting Asphodelaceae for Xanthorrhoeaceae (Asparagales) and Francoaceae for Melianthaceae (Geraniales); however, in Francoaceae we also include Bersamaceae, Ledocarpaceae, Rhynchothecaceae and Vivianiaceae. Other changes to family limits are not drastic or numerous and are mostly focused on some members of the lamiids, especially the former Icacinaceae that have long been problematic with several genera moved to the formerly monogeneric Metteniusaceae, but minor changes in circumscription include Aristolochiaceae (now including Lactoridaceae and Hydnoraceae; Aristolochiales), Maundiaceae (removed from Juncaginaceae; Alismatales), Restionaceae (now re-including Anarthriaceae and Centrolepidaceae; Poales), Buxaceae (now including Haptanthaceae; Buxales), Peraceae (split from Euphorbiaceae; Malpighiales), recognition of Petenaeaceae (Huerteales), Kewaceae, Limeaceae, Macarthuriaceae and Microteaceae (all Caryophyllales), Petiveriaceae split from Phytolaccaceae (Caryophyllales), changes to the generic composition of Ixonanthaceae and Irvingiaceae (with transfer of Allantospermum from the former to the latter; Malpighiales), transfer of Pakaraimaea (formerly Dipterocarpaceae) to Cistaceae (Malvales), transfer of Borthwickia, Forchhammeria, Stixis and Tirania (formerly all Capparaceae) to Resedaceae (Brassicales), Nyssaceae split from Cornaceae (Cornales), Pteleocarpa moved to Gelsemiaceae (Gentianales), changes to the generic composition of Gesneriaceae (Sanango moved from Loganiaceae) and Orobanchaceae (now including Lindenbergiaceae and Rehmanniaceae) and recognition of Mazaceae distinct from Phrymaceae (all Lamiales).",,10.1111/boj.12385,10958339,1,,,84961836718 (Scopus),00244074,1,20,2016-05-01,,https://doi.org/10.1111/boj.12385,Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society,181

These soluble Aβ species, including oligomers and protofibrils, have been well-studied in vitro and are formed via non-covalent self-assembly of Aβ monomers. While both 40- and 42-residue forms of Aβ are observed in the human body, the majority of the Aβ aggregation work has been conducted on Aβ42 or Aβ40 separately, with relatively few investigations of mixtures. In order to study the effect of different combinations of Aβ40 and Aβ42 on protofibril formation, mixtures of either dry solid peptide, or purified Aβ40 and Aβ42 monomer solutions were mixed together and protofibril/monomer distributions were quantified. Increases in the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio increased protofibril formation but the presence of Aβ40 in the mixed Aβ solutions had a significant negative impact on protofibril formation compared to equivalent solutions of pure Aβ42. Protofibril size was less affected, but β-sheet structure increased with protofibrils formed from higher Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio solutions. Direct measurement of Aβ42/Aβ40 ratios by C-terminal-selective ELISA found very little Aβ40 incorporated into protofibrils.

Consequently, we propose a dynamic perspective for understanding the relationship between voluntary organizations and neighborhood crime that involves longitudinal analyses and the measurement of the age of organizations. By using longitudinal data on a sample of census blocks (N = 87,641) located across 10 cities, we test the relationship between age-graded measures of different types of voluntary organizations and neighborhood crime rates. We use fixed-effects negative binomial regression models that focus on change within neighborhoods of the relationship between voluntary organizations and neighborhood crime. Our results show that although each type of voluntary organization is found to exhibit crime-reducing behavior in neighborhoods, we find that many of them are consistent with what we refer to as the ""delayed impact scenario""-there is a pronounced delay between the placement of a voluntary organization and a neighborhood subsequently experiencing a reduction in crime. With protective effects of organizations typically not demonstrated until several years after being in the neighborhood, these patterns suggest a need for long-term investment strategies when examining organizations.",,10.1111/1745-9125.12101,17459125,212,,,84959456971 (Scopus),00111384,2,241,2016-05-01,,https://doi.org/10.1111/1745-9125.12101,Criminology,54

We argue that paradigmatic explanations in cognitive neuroscience fit this framework and thus that cognitive neuroscience constitutes a revolutionary break from traditional cognitive science. Whereas traditional cognitive scientific explanations were supposed to be distinct and autonomous from mechanistic explanations, neurocognitive explanations aim to be mechanistic through and through. Neurocognitive explanations aim to integrate computational and representational functions and structures across multiple levels of organization in order to explain cognition. To a large extent, practicing cognitive neuroscientists have already accepted this shift, but philosophical theory has not fully acknowledged and appreciated its significance. As a result, the explanatory framework underlying cognitive neuroscience has remained largely implicit.

Based on a unique combination of seasonal pan-tropical data sets from 89 experimental sites (68 include aboveground wood productivity measurements and 35 litter productivity measurements), their associated canopy photosynthetic capacity (enhanced vegetation index, EVI) and climate, we ask how carbon assimilation and aboveground allocation are related to climate seasonality in tropical forests and how they interact in the seasonal carbon cycle. We found that canopy photosynthetic capacity seasonality responds positively to precipitation when rainfall is &lt; 2000ĝ€-mmĝ€-yrĝ'1 (water-limited forests) and to radiation otherwise (light-limited forests). On the other hand, independent of climate limitations, wood productivity and litterfall are driven by seasonal variation in precipitation and evapotranspiration, respectively.

First-order control by precipitation likely indicates a decrease in tropical forest productivity in a drier climate in water-limited forest, and in current light-limited forest with future rainfall &lt; 2000ĝ€-mmĝ€-yrĝ'1.

Prior research generally specifies the fear of crime as an outcome variable in order to understand its complex etiology. More recently, however, researchers have suggested fear has a deterrence function whereby it reduces individuals’ involvement in violent encounters. This notion could hold important clues to understand the social sources of violence. We examine whether the fear of crime inhibits involvement in violent encounters, both as offender or victim, and if adjustments in routine activities explain these effects. The results suggest fear of crime reduces violence involvement, in part, by constraining routine activities. We conclude that the fear of crime appears to be a mechanism of violence mitigation that, paradoxically, bolsters physical well-being.

The porcelains have been regarded as strictly imitative, without crediting the sculptor with any originality. The author seeks to challenge that assumption, by revisiting the original shepherd and shepherdess from Favart's play and analyzing in detail how the painter Boucher and the unknown sculptor of Sèvres provided their own interpretations.

Among these individuals, transgender women reported significantly more lifetime internet sexual partners (median = 3) than transgender men (median = 1). Use of the internet to meet sexual partners was associated with lower self-esteem but not with depression, anxiety, somatic distress or discrimination experiences. Among transgender women, use of the internet to meet sexual partners was associated with each of the 11 sexual risk behaviors examined, including having multiple partners, sex under the influence of drugs, number of unprotected anal or vaginal sex acts, and history of commercial sex work. The use of the internet to meet partners was not associated with sexual risk behavior among transgender men (0/11 variables assessed).

Nevertheless, two issues have emerged in prior studies. First, fear and disgust were inappropriately treated as a single category, which is particularly concerning given that they have been recently demonstrated to exert different impacts on inhibitory control. Second, inhibitory control might not be a unitary construct, as it can be further divided into proactive and reactive inhibition. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate whether fearful and disgusting distracters have differential effects on proactive and reactive inhibition. Twenty-four female participants were instructed to perform a modified stop-signal task superimposed on a fearful, disgusting, or neutral image cue. Results showed that fearful distracters improved reactive inhibition when compared to disgusting and neutral distracters, while disgusting distracters enhanced proactive inhibition when compared to fearful distracters. Further, reactive and proactive inhibition was positively correlated under fearful, disgusting, and neutral contexts. This study is the first to provide evidence that fear and disgust may affect proactive and reactive inhibition differently.

Method: Secondary analysis of data from the National Survey of American Life (2001-2003) was conducted. A nationally representative sample of African-American emerging adults, ages 18 to 29 years (N = 806), was assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. The sample included females and males with a mean age of 23 years. Evaluated need was determined by endorsement of mood, anxiety, substance use, or impulse control diagnoses. Respondents who reported ever voluntarily using mental health or general medical services to address these problems were considered to have used services. Results: Forty-seven percent of the sample demonstrated an evaluated need for services, whereas a quarter of the sample used services in their lifetime. Respondents who were females, had received religious/spiritual support, and who had an evaluated need for services were significantly more likely to have used services in their lifetime compared with males, those who had not received religious/spiritual support, and those without a need for services. Conclusions: Literature indicates that evaluated need is a strong predictor of mental health service use, yet research examining its impact on service use among African American emerging adults is limited. This study found that along with having an evaluated need, this population was more likely to use services when supported by a religious/spiritual leader.

In this application, we use CACC to address whether and how “context” matters for desistance by constructing complex role configurations of life events, their timing, and their ordering and examining their influence on desistance. Methods: Longitudinal life event and official offending data are drawn from a community cohort of African American males and females. Using CACC, we focus on (1) identifying the most common role configurations of number, timing, and ordering of life events in the sample (i.e., the dominant case configurations); (2) testing main effect hypotheses of each measure; and (3) exploring potential interaction effects. The findings from the CACC are then used to inform a logistic regression model to statistically test for the identified main and interactive effects. Results: First, the dominant case configurations are largely ones that are “off time” and “out of order.” Second, there is a main effect of dosage in that those experiencing four life events were more likely to desist than those with two life events. Finally, CACC revealed a potential three-way interaction effect among the number, timing, and ordering of life events on desistance, which was confirmed by the logistic regression analysis. Conclusions: CACC is a useful tool for teasing out the complex relationships inherent in life course criminological questions.

However, cyanobacteria are the only prokaryotic group for which bona fide circadian properties have been persuasively documented, even though homologs of the cyanobacterial kaiABC central clock genes are distributed widely among Eubacteria and Archaea. We report the purple non-sulfur bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris (that harbors homologs of kaiB and kaiC) only poorly sustains rhythmicity in constant conditions–a defining characteristic of circadian rhythms. Moreover, the biochemical characteristics of the Rhodopseudomonas homolog of the KaiC protein in vivo and in vitro are different from those of cyanobacterial KaiC. Nevertheless, R. palustris cells exhibit adaptive kaiC-dependent growth enhancement in 24-h cyclic environments, but not under non-natural constant conditions. Therefore, our data indicate that Rhodopseudomonas does not have a classical circadian rhythm, but a novel timekeeping mechanism that does not sustain itself in constant conditions. These results question the adaptive value of self-sustained oscillatory capability for daily timekeepers and establish new criteria for circadian-like systems that are based on adaptive properties (i.e., fitness enhancement in rhythmic environments), rather than upon observations of persisting rhythms in constant conditions. We propose that the Rhodopseudomonas system is a ""proto"" circadian timekeeper, as in an ancestral system that is based on KaiC and KaiB proteins and includes some, but not necessarily all, of the canonical properties of circadian clocks.

Preterm birth can cause serious health problems in newborns, as well as large financial burdens to society. Various techniques such as electromyography (EMG) and magnetomyography (MMG) have been developed to quantify uterine contractions. However, no widely accepted method to predict labor based on electromagnetic measurement is available. Therefore, developing a biophysical model of EMG and MMG could help better understand uterine contractions, interpret real measurements, and detect labor. In this work, we propose a multiscale realistic model of uterine contractions during pregnancy. At the cellular level, building on bifurcation theory, we apply generalized FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) equations that produces both plateau-type and bursting-type action potentials. At the tissue level, we introduce a random fiber orientation model applicable to an arbitrary uterine shape. We also develop an analytical expression for the propagation speed of transmembrane potential. At the organ level, a realistic volume conductor geometry model is provided based on magnetic resonance images of a pregnant woman. To simulate the measurements from the SQUID Array for Reproductive Assessment (SARA) device, we propose a sensor array model. Our model is able to reproduce the characteristics of action potentials. Additionally, we investigate the sensitivity of MMG to model configuration aspects such as volume geometry, fiber orientation, and pacemaker location. Our numerical results show that fiber orientation and pacemaker location are the key aspects that greatly affect the MMG as measured by the SARA device. We conclude that sphere is appropriate as an approximation of the volume geometry. The initial step towards validating the model against real MMG measurement is also presented.

Feral goats Capra hircus, donkeys Equus asinus, and pigs Sus scrofa were eradicated from Santiago Island in the Galapagos Archipelago by 2005. Because feral goats were the dominant herbivores on Santiago Island until their eradication, we examined the consequences of goat eradication on the diet of territorial Galapagos Hawks Buteo galapagoensis through a comparative study of observations of prey deliveries to nests before 1999-2000 and after 2010-2011 eradication. We predicted that vegetation recovery after eradication would limit the hawks' hunting success of terrestrial prey and they would therefore switch to predominantly arboreal prey. We did not observe the predicted switch from terrestrial to arboreal prey in the diet; on the contrary, after goat eradication, hawks delivered significantly fewer arboreal prey items. However, introduced black rats Rattus rattus represented a significantly greater proportion of the hawks' diet after eradication, particularly in moderate to dense vegetation arid and transition habitats, replacing other prey items. Overall, 73% of total prey biomass delivered after eradication consisted of introduced rats, compared to only 20% before eradication.

In this study, we evaluated the effects of spatial extent (i.e. size of study region) on: 1) whether community composition can be better explained by environmental (i.e. niche-based) or spatial (e.g. dispersal-based) processes; and 2) how climate and soils contribute to the influence of environment on plant community composition. We surveyed community composition across a network of 398 forest plots spanning a ∼4000 m elevational gradient in the Madidi region in northwestern Bolivia. Using redundancy analyses and hierarchical variation partitioning, we disentangled the effects of environmental and spatial predictors on species composition, further decomposing the environmental effect between its climatic and soil components. We repeated analyses for 200 sub-regions ranging in spatial extent from ∼250 to ∼17 500 km2. Our analyses show a high degree of idiosyncrasy in results that come from different sub-regions. Despite this variability, we were able to identify various important patterns in the structure of tropical plant communities in our study system. First, even though sub-regions varied in size by nearly two orders of magnitude, the total amount of explained variation in community composition was scale independent; at all spatial scales, environment and space accounted for about 25% of the differences in community composition among plots. Second, the measured environmental effect was higher than the spatial effect on average and in the vast majority of sub-regions. This was true regardless of the spatial extent of analysis.

Particular attention is paid to the dynamics of the rural data series. Methods: NCVS data for 1973–2010 are used to estimate subnational rates of serious violence and comparable rates for crimes that victims said were reported to police, and these estimates are compared to subnational UCR data. Time-series cointegration analysis is used to assess convergence in the NCVS and UCR series along with descriptive comparative analyses. Results: The degree of convergence in UCR and NCVS trends was found to vary across areas; however this was not due to differences in rates of reporting to police. Suburban and urban UCR and NCVS trends converged with and without adjustment for police reporting. Little evidence of NCVS/UCR series convergence was found in rural areas even after victim reporting was taken into account. Conclusion: The recording and production of crime data by the police appears to contribute to subnational differences in the convergence between the UCR and NCVS series. The findings suggest rural crime trend analysis should not be based solely on UCR data.

Our aim was to understand the relationships between the strength of the oligarchic patterns, diversities (alpha, beta and gamma), and five potential causes (elevational variability, soil heterogeneity, elevation, soil conditions and geographical extent). Location: The Amazon-Andes transition in the Madidi region (Bolivia). Methods: We established 398 plots of 0.1 ha each, containing 121,183 individual woody plants belonging to 2390 species. Then we defined 500 sub-regions (= unique overlapping subsets of 50 plots from the pool of 398 plots) so they varied in extent from 220 to 17,700 km2 within the study area. We employed two independent path analyses to relate environmental characteristics and geographical extent of sub-regions to (1) oligarchic strength and (2) alpha, beta and gamma diversities. We used generalized linear models to relate diversities to different measures of oligarchic strength. Results: Oligarchies at larger extents were weaker, a trend strongly driven by the pure effect of area and, secondarily, by environmental heterogeneity. Oligarchies at higher elevations were weaker than expected, and oligarchies in acidic and nutrients-poor soils were not stronger than those in less stressful soils. Trends in oligarchic strength were inversely correlated with those of gamma and beta diversity: weaker oligarchies were found in species-rich and heterogeneous communities. Main conclusions: Environmental heterogeneity and low landscape connectivity limit the strength of the oligarchic pattern. Although diversities (particularly beta diversity) and oligarchic strength are closely related, they are somewhat differently driven by external factors. In particular, oligarchic strength is more sensitive to spatial extent and less sensitive to environmental heterogeneity than beta diversity.

The fragmentation of uranyl-acetone (aco) complexes ([UO2(aco)n]2+, n = 1-5), generated by electrospray ionization, is revisited here using: (a) collisional activation in a linear ion trap (LIT) mass spectrometer in which the level of background H2O is significantly lower, and (b) infrared multiple-photon photodissociation (IRMPD, 10.6 μm) in the LIT and a Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometer. Lower levels of adventitious H2O in the LIT provided access to fragmentation of [UO2(aco)n]2+, n = 1-5. For n = 3-5, direct elimination of aco ligands is the favored fragmentation pathway. For n = 1 and 2, charge reduction reactions are dominant.

Post-LGM, water-dispersed coastal species, including the red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle), expanded poleward as propagules were transported by ocean currents. We assessed postglacial marine expansion pathways for R. mangle within the Caribbean Basin and Florida. METHODS: Six microsatellite loci were used to genotype 237 individuals from nine R. mangle populations in the Caribbean, Florida, and Northwest Africa. We evaluated genetic variation, population structure, gene flow along alternative post-LGM expansion pathways to Florida, and potential long-distance dispersal (LDD) from West Africa to Caribbean islands. KEY RESULTS: These R. mangle populations had substantial genetic structure (FST = 0.37, P < 0.0001) with three discrete population clusters (Caribbean mainland, Caribbean islands, and Florida). Genetic connectivity along the mainland pathway (Caribbean mainland to Florida) vs. limited gene dispersal along the Antilles Island pathway (Caribbean islands to Florida) supported Florida recolonization from Caribbean mainland sources. Genetic similarity of North- west Africa and two Caribbean islands provided evidence for trans-Atlantic LDD. We did not find a pattern of decreasing genetic diversity with latitude. CONCLUSIONS: We outline a complex expansion history for R. mangle, with discrete pathways of recolonization for Florida and Caribbean islands. Contrary to expectation, connectivity to putative Caribbean mainland refugial populations via ocean currents, and not latitude, appears to dictate genetic diversity within Caribbean island and Florida R. mangle.

Results indicated that the academic performance of students from the first semester of the 8th grade positively predicted self-efficacy beliefs for the second semester of the 8th grade and that self-efficacy beliefs from the second semester of the 8th grade positively predicted the academic achievement of students for the first semester of the 9th grade; this pattern evidenced through to the 12th grade. A reciprocal relationship between self-efficacy beliefs and academic achievement was seen, such that the effect of past academic performance on self-efficacy beliefs was larger than the effect of selfefficacy beliefs on academic achievement.

Our aim was to characterize the geographic origins of two Plasmodium parasite lineages detected in the Galapagos Islands and in North American breeding bobolinks (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) that regularly stop in Galapagos during migration to their South American overwintering sites. We used samples from a grassland breeding bird assemblage in Nebraska, United States, and parasite DNA sequences from the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador, to compare to global data in a DNA sequence registry. Homologous DNA sequences from parasites detected in bobolinks and more sedentary birds (e.g., brown-headed cowbirds Molothrus ater, and other co-occurring bird species resident on the North American breeding grounds) were compared to those recovered in previous studies from global sites. One parasite lineage that matched between Galapagos birds and the migratory bobolink, Plasmodium lineage B, was the most common lineage detected in the global MalAvi database, matching 49 sequences from unique host/site combinations, 41 of which were of South American origin. We did not detect lineage B in brown-headed cowbirds. The other Galapagos-bobolink match, Plasmodium lineage C, was identical to two other sequences from birds sampled in California. We detected a close variant of lineage C in brown-headed cowbirds. Taken together, this pattern suggests that bobolinks became infected with lineage B on the South American end of their migratory range, and with lineage C on the North American breeding grounds. Overall, we detected more parasite lineages in bobolinks than in cowbirds. Galapagos Plasmodium had similar host breadth compared to the non-Galapagos haemosporidian lineages detected in bobolinks, brown-headed cowbirds, and other grassland species. This study highlights the utility of global haemosporidian data in the context of migratory bird-parasite connectivity.

This single-site, randomized controlled trial examined the effectiveness of sleep-directed hypnosis as a complement to an empirically supported psychotherapy for PTSD (cognitive processing therapy [CPT]). Method: Participants completed either 3 weeks of hypnosis (n = 52) or a symptom monitoring control condition (n = 56) before beginning standard CPT. Multilevel modeling was used to investigate differential patterns of change to determine whether hypnosis resulted in improvements in sleep, PTSD, and depression. An intervening variable approach was then used to determine whether improvements in sleep achieved during hypnosis augmented change in PTSD and depression during CPT. Results: After the initial phase of treatment (hypnosis or symptom monitoring), the hypnosis condition showed significantly greater improvement than the control condition in sleep and depression, but not PTSD. After CPT, both conditions demonstrated significant improvement in sleep and PTSD; however, the hypnosis condition demonstrated greater improvement in depressive symptoms. As sleep improved, there were corresponding improvements in PTSD and depression, with a stronger relationship between sleep and PTSD.

The objective of our study was to examine the relationship between grassland birds and vegetation structure in the Northern Campos of Uruguay. Vegetation variables were sampled on 4 sites that differed in agricultural management: (1) ""Crop"" site, a combination of annual crops and seeded pastures; (2) ""Pasture"" site, seeded pastures only; (3) ""Native 1"" site, natural grasslands under sheep and cattle grazing; and (4) ""Native 2"" site, natural grasslands grazed by native Pampas deer (Ozotoceros bezoarticus) and cattle. We used multivariate analyses to examine the relationship between bird abundance and vegetation variables. Vegetation structure varied among sites, and most of these differences can be linked to specific management activities typical of each site. Mean vegetation height was greater (and more variable) in cultivated grasslands (Crop and Pasture sites), whereas mean percentage grass contacts (grass cover) was greater in natural grasslands (Native 1 and 2 sites). Vegetation variables accounted for a significant amount of variation in bird distribution and abundance (14.8%). Grassland birds were associated most strongly with vegetation height, grass cover, and vegetation patchiness. Some of the species associated with the highest values for these environmental gradients were Dark-throated Seedeater (Sporophila ruficollis), with vegetation height; Pampas Meadowlark (Sturnella defilippii), with grass cover; and Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia), with vegetation patchiness. Unlike facultative species, many grassland-specialist birds were associated with characteristic features (i.e. high grass cover) of natural grasslands used by livestock. Others, however, were associated with typical features (i.e. taller vegetation) of cultivated grasslands. Thus, Pampas grassland bird populations would benefit not only from native-grassland preservation efforts, but also from management guidelines for agriculture-dominated lands.",,10.1650/CONDOR-15-49.1,,12,Wildlife Conservation Society,,84946866302 (Scopus),00105422,1,23,2016-02-01,,https://doi.org/10.1650/CONDOR-15-49.1,Condor,118

It achieved this by docking only known actives to the experimental structures without considering a large number of decoys to reduce computational costs. The SPI is calculated by using the docking energies of the actives to all the receptor structures. We evaluated the performance of the SPI by applying it to study eight protein systems: fatty acid binding protein adipocyte FABP4, serine/threonine-protein kinase BRAF, beta-1 adrenergic receptor ADRB1, TGF-beta receptor type I TGFR1, adenosylhomocysteinase SAHH, thyroid hormone receptor beta-1 THB, phospholipase A2 group IIA PA2GA, and cytochrome P450 3a4 CP3A4. We found that the SPI agreed with the results from other popular performance metrics such as Boltzmann-Enhanced Discrimination Receiver Operator Characteristics (BEDROC), Robust Initial Enhancement (RIE), Area Under Accumulation Curve (AUAC), and Enrichment Factor (EF) but is less expensive to calculate. SPI also performed better than the best docking energy, the molecular volume of the bound ligand, and the resolution of crystal structure in selecting good receptor structures for virtual screening.

Our recently published work indicates that retrotransposons in Drosophila tissue culture cells are actively transcribed in the antisense direction. Our data support a model in which convergent transcription of retrotransposons from intra element transcription start sites results in complementary RNAs that hybridize to form substrates for Dicer-2, the endogenous small interfering (esi)RNA generating enzyme. Here, we extend our previous analysis to TIR Tns. In contrast to retrotransposons, our data show that antisense TIR Tn RNAs result from transcription of intronic TIR Tns oriented antisense to their host genes. Also, disproportionately less esiRNAs are generated from TIR transcripts than from retrotransposons and transcription of very few individual TIR Tns could be confirmed.

Correlation of driver gender with injury severity in large truck crashes in Missouri,-,-,-,-,-,-,https://doi.org/10.3141/2585-06,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85015680541,,"Large trucks are vital for shipping freight in the United States but are also a dangerous mode of transportation. From 2002 to 2012, 91,145 crashes involving large trucks were recorded in Missouri, resulting in 1,156 fatalities and 18,457 injuries. Many factors contribute to the severity of a large truck crash; these factors and their effects on severity may vary as a function of gender. Missouri crash data from 2002 to 2012 were analyzed to identify circumstances that increased the probability of injury severity outcomes in the event of a large truck crash. Chi-square automatic interaction detector decision tree models were developed for each gender to understand predictor importance better and to uncover interactions between contributing factors. Results suggest that the major correlations with levels of injury severity are following too closely, physical impairment, and improper passing for female Missouri drivers with a commercial driver's license (CDL) and driving too fast for conditions, failing to yield, and physical impairment for male Missouri CDL drivers. Results suggest that environmental factors are not significant predictors of severity outcome for female CDL drivers; however, road and lighting conditions play a tertiary role for male CDL drivers. Recommendations based on study results include encouraging truck driver training programs to focus educational efforts on gender-specific behaviors that affect crash injury severity to enhance road safety.",,10.3141/2585-06,,49,,,85015680541 (Scopus),03611981,,58,2016-01-01,,https://doi.org/10.3141/2585-06,Transportation Research Record,2585

This need for multiple perspectives requires mixed-methods research. Philosophy and practicality are needed to plan, conduct, and make mixed-methods research more broadly accessible to the health sciences research community. The traditions and dichotomy between qualitative and quantitative research makes the application of mixed methods a challenge. Aim To propose an integrated model for a research project containing steps from start to finish, and to use the unique strengths brought by each approach to meet the health needs of patients and communities. Discussion Mixed-methods research is a practical approach to inquiry, that focuses on asking questions and how best to answer them to improve the health of individuals, communities and populations. An integrated model of research begins with the research question(s) and moves in a continuum. The lines dividing methods do not dissolve, but become permeable boundaries where two or more methods can be used to answer research questions more completely. Rigorous and expert methodologists work together to solve common problems. Conclusion Mixed-methods research enables discussion among researchers from varied traditions. There is a plethora of methodological approaches available. Combining expertise by communicating across disciplines and professions is one way to tackle large and complex healthcare issues. Implications for practice The model presented in this paper exemplifies the integration of multiple approaches in a unified focus on identified phenomena.

Design/methodology/approach: This essay incorporates both a philosophical and an ethical analysis approach. It is based on Plato’s Allegory of the Cave, philosophical notions of transparency and presence and human values including psychological well-being, physical well-being, privacy, deception, informed consent, ownership and property and trust. Findings: The paper concludes that the interactions among developers, users and non-users via AVFDs have implications for autonomy. It also identifies issues of ownership that arise because of the blending of physical and virtual space and important ways that these devices impact, identity and trust. Practical implications: Developers ought to take time to design and implement an easy-to-use informed consent system with these devices. There is a strong need for consent protocols among developers, users and non-users of AVFDs. Social implications: There is a social benefit to users sharing what is visible on their devices with those who are in close physical proximity, but this introduces tension between notions of personal privacy and the establishment and maintenance of social norms. Originality/value: There is new analysis of how AVFDs impact individual identity and the attendant ties to notions of ownership of the space between an object and someone’s eyes and control over perception.",,10.1108/JICES-10-2015-0035,17588871,214,,,84982918819 (Scopus),1477996X,3,230,2016-01-01,,https://doi.org/10.1108/JICES-10-2015-0035,"Journal of Information, Communication and Ethics in Society",14

We used radiotelemetry to study and compare the spatial ecology of Armenian Vipers inhabiting a human-modified landscape near Abovian in Koytak Province and a recovered-natural landscape in Shikahogh State Reserve in Syunik Province. Radio-tracking at Abovian took place during 2008-2009 (8 males, 6 females) and during 2010-2012 at Shikahogh State Reserve (7 males, 4 females). Prey surveys were conducted at both sites to evaluate the abundance of small mammals. We found significant differences between the two populations in terms of home range size and mean movements. Home range and movements were significantly larger in the human-modified landscape.We found no difference in body condition between the two landscapes or a correlation between body condition and home range size. Prey abundance was significantly higher in the recovered-natural landscape.

On the other hand, there is very little research examining the effect of combining these therapies on peak cortisol levels. For the current analyses, we examined the effectiveness of CBT augmentation on peak cortisol levels in older adults diagnosed with GAD. Methods: The sample consisted of 42 individuals with late-life GAD who received an acute course of the SSRI escitalopram and then entered a 16-week randomized phase. Twenty-one participants were randomized to receive 16 sessions of CBT in addition to continuing escitalopram and the remaining 21 participants continued on escitalopram without CBT. Generalized estimating equations were performed to assess the effectiveness of CBT augmentation on peak cortisol levels (30 min after waking). Results: Older adults with GAD who received both escitalopram and CBT demonstrated a significant reduction in peak cortisol levels at posttreatment compared to the group who received escitalopram without CBT augmentation.

Here, the history of diversification of one of these lineages, the genus Pagamea (Rubiaceae), is reconstructed through phylogenetic hypotheses. Data from chloroplast (rps16 and rpl20-rps12) and nuclear (ITS) markers were incongruent, with ITS found to be more consistent with morphological criteria to delimit species. Reconstruction of the ancestral area for the genus was ambiguous, with both the western Guiana Shield and the Atlantic coastal areas containing early divergent lineages, but most speciation events appeared to have happened in the western Guiana Shield where most extant diversity is present. Dispersal events into the western Amazon and the Andes (1.5-4.5 Ma) and the eastern Guiana Shield (0.4-2.2 Ma) were followed by speciation events in these regions. Dispersal events between the Amazon and Atlantic rain forest occurred at least three times independently. However, dispersals into new areas were limited, and most regions were found to be phylogenetically clustered. Altitudinal and habitat shifts happened multiple times independently, but ecological traits were found to be phylogenetically conserved, implying that such shifts were not the cause of lineage divergence. The result that most speciation events happened in the western Guiana Shield, where white-sand habitats predominate in both lowlands and highlands, and which has been less affected by Pleistocene climatic change, coupled with the result that ecological traits are phylogenetically conserved, suggests that the diversification of Pagamea may have been related primarily to the patchy distribution of white-sand vegetation.",,10.1111/btp.12295,17447429,58,,,84956700275 (Scopus),00063606,1,69,2016-01-01,,https://doi.org/10.1111/btp.12295,Biotropica,48

To repress these elements and combat genomic instability, eukaryotes have evolved several small RNA-mediated defense mechanisms. Specifically, in Drosophila somatic cells, endogenous small interfering (esi)RNAs suppress retrotransposon mobility. EsiRNAs are produced by Dicer-2 processing of double-stranded RNA precursors, yet the origins of these precursors are unknown. We show that most transposon families are transcribed in both the sense (S) and antisense (AS) direction in Dmel-2 cells. LTR retrotransposons Dm297, mdg1, and blood, and non-LTR retrotransposons juan and jockey transcripts, are generated from intraelement transcription start sites with canonical RNA polymerase II promoters. We also determined that retrotransposon antisense transcripts are less polyadenylated than sense. RNA-seq and small RNA-seq revealed that Dicer-2 RNA interference (RNAi) depletion causes a decrease in the number of esiRNAs mapping to retrotransposons and an increase in expression of both S and AS retrotransposon transcripts. These data support a model in which double-stranded RNA precursors are derived from convergent transcription and processed by Dicer-2 into esiRNAs that silence both sense and antisense retrotransposon transcripts. Reduction of sense retrotransposon transcripts potentially lowers element-specific protein levels to prevent transposition. This mechanism preserves genomic integrity and is especially important for Drosophila fitness because mobile genetic elements are highly active.",,10.1534/genetics.115.177196,19432631,107,National Institute of General Medical Sciences,R15GM107931,84953931481 (Scopus),00166731,1,121,2016-01-01,26534950.0,https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.115.177196,Genetics,202

We sought to investigate imaging correlates of incomplete cognitive recovery among individuals with chronic HIV. Methods: We used single voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in 4 regions of the brain to measure changes in neuronal and glia biomarkers in cART-naive subjects before (n 59, 27 with HAND) and after 12 months of cART. Results: At baseline, we observed elevated total choline (CHO) in the basal ganglia (BG, P 0.002) and in the posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG, P 0.022) associated with HIV infection. Myo-inositol (MI) was elevated in the frontal white matter (FWM, P 0.040). N-acetylaspartate was elevated in the BG (P 0.047). Using a mixed model approach among all HIV-infected individuals, at 6 months, we observed decreased n- acetylaspartate in FWM (P 0.031), decreased creatine in PCG (P 0.026) and increased MI in frontal gray matter (FGM, P 0.023). At 12 months, we observed an increase in BG MI (P 0.038) and in FGM (P 0.021). Compared to those with normal cognition, HAND cases had higher FGM MI (P 0.014) at baseline. At 12 months, individuals that remained cognitively impaired compared with those without HAND exhibited elevated CHO in the PCG (P 0.018) and decreased glutamate in both FWM (P 0.027) and BG (P 0.013). Conclusions: cART started during chronic HIV is associated with reduced neuronal-glia and inflammatory markers. Alterations in CHO are noted among individuals who remain impaired after 12 months of cART.",,10.1097/QAI.0000000000000779,10779450,24,National Institute of Mental Health,R01MH102151,84951129757 (Scopus),15254135,1,30,2016-01-01,26258565.0,https://doi.org/10.1097/QAI.0000000000000779,Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes,71
Visual exploration of HARDI fibers with probabilistic tracking,OA,-,-,Bronze OA,-,-,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ins.2015.04.045,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84949313773,"3D ellipsoidal glyghs, Fiber bundle classification, Pixel bar, Probabilistic tractography","High angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) is an effective method for characterizing complex neural fiber paths in the human brain. However, visualizing and analyzing the fibers is often challenging because of the complexity of the fiber orientation distribution function used to describe the crossing, kissing, and fanning fibers. In this paper, we propose a novel visual analytics approach to study brain fiber paths that allows users to explore fiber bundles to reveal the probability of fiber paths using a new visual classification method. First, we use a spherical deconvolution model for diffusion estimation and a Bayesian theorem for fiber tractography. Second, each fiber is subjected to a cluster analysis using pixel-based visual encoding. This result is shown in a pixel-based visual representation where each pixel bar maps opacity, color, and length to the probability, direction, and length of a fiber. Fiber bundles can then be acquired via a two-step classification routine that uses DBSCAN to group fibers based on similarities. Then the user can further refine fiber bundle selection using probabilistic information from the pixel bars. Therefore, the proposed approach shows not only the shape but also the confidence of the fiber paths. We demonstrate the resulting HARDI fiber bundles and compare a brain with tumor and normal brain using our system. Experiments and an empirical user study verify the effectiveness of our approach.",,10.1016/j.ins.2015.04.045,,483,National Science Foundation,NSF1117871,84949313773 (Scopus),00200255,,494,2016-01-01,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ins.2015.04.045,Information Sciences,330

The procedural justice framework suggests this delinquency amplification is due, in part, to the negative consequences of police contact on evaluations of the police. Using four waves of data, we explore the multiple ways in which being stopped or arrested and procedural injustice act in concert to affect later delinquency. We also assess how these effects differ based on youth’s evaluations of their police encounters. Our findings indicate that the total effect of being stopped or arrested on delinquency depends on the youth’s level of satisfaction with the encounter. In addition, procedural injustice mediates some of the effect of contact on delinquency, but its relationship with delinquency is not direct. We conclude that the negative consequences of being stopped or arrested are mitigated, but not eliminated, when contact is perceived favorably.",,10.1177/0093854815609069,15523594,7,U.S. Department of Justice,2006-JV-FX-0011,84948458046 (Scopus),00938548,1,26,2016-01-01,,https://doi.org/10.1177/0093854815609069,Criminal Justice and Behavior,43

Further, the impact of the threonine variant on cognitive function remains unknown. The present study utilized multiple indices of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neuropsychological assessment to examine the integrity of specific white matter tracts and cognition between individuals with homozygous genotypes of M268T (MetMet n= 27, ThrThr n= 27). Differences in subcortical hyperintensity (SH) volume were also examined between groups. Results indicated that the threonine variant was associated with significantly reduced integrity in the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) and the cingulate gyrus segment of the cingulum bundle (cingulum CG) compared to those with the methionine variant, and poorer cognitive performance on tests of attention/processing speed and language. Despite these associations, integrity of these tracts did not significantly mediate relationships between cognition and genetic status, and SH did not differ significantly between groups. Collectively our results suggest that the threonine variant of M268T is a significant risk factor for abnormalities in specific white matter tracts and cognitive domains in healthy older adults, independent of SH burden.",,10.1016/j.bbr.2015.08.028,18727549,85,National Institutes of Health,UL1 TR000448,84941299793 (Scopus),01664328,,93,2016-01-01,26318936.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2015.08.028,Behavioural Brain Research,296
