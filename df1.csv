A multi-center, cross-sectional survey was conducted between April and July 2010 in 50 medical centers in the Mainland China. Participants were recruited from inpatients and outpatients who were admitted to or visited those medical centers. The survey included core questions about their demographic characteristics, diabetes self-management behavior, and A1c knowledge. Overall, of 5957 patients, the percentage of patients with good understanding was 25.3%. In the multivariable logistic regression model, the variables related to the knowledge of A1c status are presented. We discovered that patients with longer diabetes duration (OR = 1.05; 95%CI = 1.04-1.06) and having received diabetes education (OR = 1.80; 95%CI = 1.49-2.17) were overrepresented in the good understanding of A1c group. In addition, compared to no education level, higher education level was statistically associated with good understanding of A1c (P<0.001). The percentage of patients with good understanding varied from region to region (P<0.001), with Eastern being highest (OR = 1.54; 95%CI = 1.32-1.80), followed by Central (OR = 1.25; 95%CI = 1.02-1.53), when referring to Western. Only a minority of patients with type 2 diabetes in China understood their A1c value.

Anne,Fish,Implementing a Self-care Clock Strategy as a Part of a Trauma Awareness Intervention,Journal of Trauma Nursing : The Official Journal of the Society of Trauma Nurses,,2022.0,,,,,Completed/Published,,,,,Spring,2022,"Abstract 
Background: Caring for individuals with traumatic stress takes a toll on nurse providers and other caregivers. Whether a Trauma Awareness Intervention, part of a larger wellness program, can influence caregivers’ attitudes about trauma-informed care is not known. The purpose of the study was to explore the use of a Trauma Awareness Intervention with nurse and other caregivers at a university setting to test it before rolling it out to larger community groups. A unique self-care clock was used.  
Methods: A quasi-experimental study and a qualitative content analysis were conducted utilizing 96 adults. We used a standardized curriculum in a one-half day session and measured attitudes related trauma-informed care: underlying causes of problem behavior and symptoms, responses to problem behavior and symptoms, on the job behavior, self-efficacy at work, reactions at work, personal support of trauma-informed care, and system-wide support for trauma-informed care.   
Results: Using bivariate regression, there were improvements in attitude (p ≤ 0.05) after the intervention compared to baseline. Compassion satisfaction at baseline was related to attitudes after the intervention (β= 0.03, SE= 0.009). Themes about behavior change were: self-awareness, self-care, empathy, applying a trauma lens, changing the narrative, and student centeredness.   
Conclusion: The intervention including a self-care clock had a positive impact on nurse and community caregivers. An important theme, changing the narrative, suggests re-focusing attitudes from “what is wrong?” to wondering “what happened to individuals?"" that leads to behavioral responses. Understanding how trauma impacts individuals is critical in building future interventions for population-level health promotion.

Anne,Fish,Radiolabeled Rhein as Small-Molecule Necrosis Avid Agents for Imaging of Necrotic Myocardium (R),Analytical chemistry,12/28/2016,2017.0,89,1260-1266,2,,Completed/Published,10.1021/acs.analchem.6b03959,27981843,,1520-6882,Spring,2017,"A rapid and accurate identification of necrotic myocardium is of great importance for diagnosis, risk stratification, clinical decision-making, and prognosis evaluation of myocardial infarction. Here, we explored technetium-99m labeled rhein derivatives for rapid imaging of the necrotic myocardium. Three hydrazinonicotinic acid-linker-rhein (HYNIC-linker-rhein) derivatives were synthesized, and then, these synthetic compounds were labeled with technetium-99m using ethylenediaminediacetic acid (EDDA) and tricine as coligands [(99m)Tc(EDDA)-HYNIC-linker-rhein]. The necrosis avidity of the three (99m)Tc-labeled rhein derivatives was tested in a mouse model of ethanol-induced muscular necrosis by gamma counting, histochemical staining, and autoradiography. A lead tracer for visualization of necrotic myocardium was assessed by single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) imaging in a rat model with reperfused myocardial infarction. The necrosis avidity mechanism of the tracer was explored by DNA binding studies in vitro and blocking experiments in vivo. Results showed that the uptake in necrotic muscles of the three (99m)Tc-compounds was higher than that in viable muscles (P < 0.001). Autoradiography and histochemical staining results were consistent with selective uptake of the radiotracer in the necrotic regions. Among the these tracers, (99m)Tc(EDDA)-HYNIC-ethylenediamine-rhein [(99m)Tc(EDDA)-HYNIC-2C-rhein] displayed the best distribution profiles for imaging. The necrotic myocardium lesions were clearly visualized by SPECT/CT using (99m)Tc(EDDA)-HYNIC-2C-rhein at 1 h after injection. The necrotic-to-viable myocardium and necrotic myocardium-to-blood uptake ratios of (99m)Tc(EDDA)-HYNIC-2C-rhein were 4.79 and 3.02 at 1 h after injection. DNA binding studies suggested HYNIC-linker-rhein bound to DNA through intercalation. The uptake of (99m)Tc(EDDA)-HYNIC-2C-rhein in necrotic muscle was significantly blocked by excessive unlabeled rhein, with 77.61% decline at 1 h after coinjection. These findings suggested (99m)Tc(EDDA)-HYNIC-2C-rhein emerged as a ""hot spot"" imaging probe that has a potential for rapid imaging of necrotic myocardium. The necrosis avidity mechanism of (99m)Tc(EDDA)-HYNIC-linker-rhein may be due to its interaction with exposed DNA in necrotic tissues.",Yicheng Ni; Anne F Fish; Yuanbo Feng; Cuihua Jiang; Dongjian Zhang; Chang Su; Zhiqi Yin; Qi Luo; Qiaomei Jin; Jian Zhang,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,,Research Board,,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

nodes and node attributes are random variables and interact with each other. We propose a probabilistic model that allows one to formulate jointly a probability distribution for these variables. This model can be described as a combination of a latent space model and a Gaussian graphical model: given the node variables, the edges will follow independent logistic distributions, with the node variables as covariates; given edges, the node variables will be distributed jointly as multivariate Gaussian, with their conditional covariance matrix depending on the graph induced by the edges. We will present some basic properties of this model, including a connection between this model and a dynamical network process involving both edges and node variables, the marginal distribution of the model for edges as a random graph model, its one-edge conditional distributions, the FKG inequality, and the existence of a limiting distribution for the edges in a infinite graph.

The synchrosqueezing transform (SST) is a powerful method for instantaneous frequency estimation and component separation of non-stationary multicomponent signals. The short-time Fourier transform-based SST (FSST for short) reassigns the frequency variable to sharpen the time-frequency representation and to separate the components of a multicomponent non-stationary signal. Very recently the FSST with a time-varying parameter, called the adaptive FSST, was introduced. The simulation experiments  show that the adaptive FSST is very promising in instantaneous frequency estimation of the component of a multicomponent signal, and in accurate component recovery.  However the theoretical analysis of the adaptive FSST has not been carried out.

In a high dimensional feature space, the method has the ability to adapt to the lower intrinsic dimension of data if the data possess such a property so that reliable statistical estimates can be performed without being hindered by the “curse of dimensionality”. The method is also capable of producing a smoother estimate for a regression function than those from standard tree methods like CART in the region where the function is smooth and also being more sensitive to discontinuities of the function than smoothing splines or other kernel methods. The estimation process in this method consists of three components: a random projection procedure that generates partitions of the feature space, a wavelet-like   orthogonal system defined on a tree that allows for a thresholding estimation of the regression function based on that tree and, finally, an averaging process that averages a number of estimates from independently generated random projection trees.

It has been used successfully for non-stationary signals separation and time-frequency representation. Linear time-frequency analysis (TFA) is another powerful tool for non-stationary signal. Linear TFAs, e.g. short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and wavelet trans-form (WT), depend linearly upon the signal analysis. In the current paper, we utilize the advantages of EMD and linear TFA to propose a new signal reconstruction method, called the empirical signal separation algorithm. First we represent the signal with STFT or WT. After that, by using an EMD-like procedure, we extract the components in the time-frequency (TF) plane one by one, adaptively and automatically. With the iterations carried out in the sifting process, the proposed method can separate non-stationary multicomponent signals with fast varying frequency components which EMD may not be able to separate. The experiments results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method compared to standard EMD, ensemble EMD and synchrosqueezing transform.",H.B.

Mary,Lacity,Relationship builders: Resolving business conflicts effectively,Outlook,,2013.0,,,,,Accepted,,,,,Spring,2013,"These days, very few enterprises go to market by themselves. The number of strategic alliances across most industries has grown  steadily over the past couple of decades, and recent studies have shown that more than 60 percent of companies worldwide now deploy outsourcing strategies as standard practice, with another 20 percent saying that cross-enterprise collaboration through outsourcing is on the way. As executives adjust to the fact that relationship building is a significant part of their job description, they are running into the challenge that all relationships have at some point, human or corporate: stuff happens  different views of each others obligations erupt; people dont always get along; expectations can conflict. Then what? In some cases, organizations involved in a long-term business relationship such as outsourcing have resolved conflicts effectivelyovercoming immediate challenges and also ultimately strengthening the overall relationship. In other cases, problems have spiraled out of control, resulting in lawsuits and damages in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Our research points to significant differences in how clients and providers in an outsourcing relationship approach conflict resolution. What we term aggressive approaches are those that focus on maximizing the short-term commercial interests of one side of the relationship. On the other hand, balanced and collaborative approachesapproaches to resolution that are no less conscious of the significant business implications and costs involvedare able to forge a path that keeps the relationship viable and thriving in the long term.

The purpose this Industry Insight is to assess the current LPO provider landscape by analyzing data on 27 LPO providers.  Design/Methodology Approach:  We analyzed LPO provider data collected in 2011 by Orbys, a leading sourcing and transformation advisory firm based in Europe. The 27 providers in the sample include specialist LPO providers, full service LPO providers, and global BPO providers that offer LPO services. We assessed LPO provider services, provider competencies, geographic location, pricing, team composition, and staff turnover rates.  Findings:   The LPO providers in the sample provide a variety of services, including litigation, intellectual property, corporate, compliance, procurement, employment, property, and consulting services.  LPO providers allocated most of their human resources to litigation (26%), intellectual property (14%) and corporate/compliance (12%) services.  LPO providers balance team compositionthe percentage of onshore resources located close to the client versus offshore resources in low-cost locationsto reduce client costs while still delivering quality services.  The overage team composition average was 22% of resources onshore and 78% of resources offshore, mostly in India.  We also analyzed LPO prices by skill level and location.  For example, the average daily rate for a fully qualified lawyer based in India was $248.  LPO provider turnover rates ranged from 3% to 34%, with an average turnover of 15%.",,,,,,,,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,,,FAS and other legacy systems,

On the sunny side, sixty-nine percent of client respondents reported that their organizations had already adopted some type of cloud services with 39% reporting more adoptions in the future. On the rainy side, current levels of client satisfaction with existing cloud services are not as high as cloud advocates would hope and there is still a large customer education gap.

Mary,Lacity,South Africas Business Process Outsourcing Services Sector: Lessons for Western-based Client Firms, The South African Journal of Business Management,4/22/2014,2014.0,,,,,Accepted,,,,,Spring,2014,"Since 2008, South Africa has become one of the worlds upcoming offshore destinations for business process outsourcing (BPO), a market estimated to be worth $US 182 billion globally by 2013. Western-based client firms evaluating South Africa as a BPO destination must consider the countrys relative value against alternative locations. Client firms also have a number of engagement models from which to choose, including outsourcing, erecting a captive centre, or acquiring an existing BPO business. The research finds that, for the UK, US, and Australian client companies in this study, South Africas value proposition is not just based on costs as other locations are often cheaper. South Africas value proposition is about overall economic value, high quality service and staff, strong cultural compatibility, and a favourable time zone.  The findings reveal that South Africa complements the global portfolio for Western-based client firms that already have BPO centres in India, the Philippines, and Eastern Europe. Moreover, whether client firms build or buy services from South Africa, the research identifies distinctive risks that need to be mitigated by investing in and effectively governing the business processes performed offshore. Finally, from the case study research, this article identifies management lessons for leveraging South Africas identifiable BPO service advantage. ",M. Lacity; L.

Reported herein is a direct conversion of thioglycosides via the regenerative approach that bypasses the intermediacy of bromides and eliminates the need for heavy-metal-based promoters.

This article describes the process of the generation of hierarchical bimodal nanoporous gold (hb-NPG) by employing a step-wise procedure involving electrochemical alloying, chemical dealloying techniques, and annealing to create both macro- and mesopores. This is done to improve the utility of NPG by creating a bicontinuous solid/void morphology. The area available for surface modification is enhanced by smaller pores, while molecular transport benefits from the network of larger pores. The bimodal architecture, which is the result of a series of fabrication steps, is visualized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) as a network of pores that are less than 100 nm in size and connected by ligaments to larger pores that are several hundred nanometers in size. The electrochemically active surface area of the hb-NPG is assessed using cyclic voltammetry (CV), with a focus on the critical roles that both dealloying and annealing play in creating the necessary structure. The adsorption of different proteins is measured by solution depletion technique, revealing the better performance of hb-NPG in terms of protein loading. By changing the surface area to volume ratio, the created hb-NPG electrode offers tremendous potential for biosensor development. The manuscript discusses a scalable method to create hb-NPG surface structures, as they offer a large surface area for the immobilization of small molecules and improved transport pathways for faster reactions.",Keith J Stine; Hafsah Ali; Jay K Bhattarai; Dharmendra Neupane; Palak Sondhi; Alexei V Demchenko,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Keith,Stine,Facile fabrication of hierarchically nanostructured gold electrode for bio-electrochemical applications,"Journal of electroanalytical chemistry (Lausanne, Switzerland)",10/3/2022,2022.0,924,,,,Completed/Published,10.1016/j.jelechem.2022.116865,36405880,PMC9673609,1572-6657,Fall,2022,"Nanoporous gold (NPG) is one of the most extensively investigated nanomaterials owing to its tunable pore size, ease of surface modification, and range of applications from catalysis, actuation, and molecular release to the development of electrochemical sensors. In an effort to improve the usefulness of NPG, a simple and robust method for the fabrication of hierarchical and bimodal nanoporous gold electrodes (hb-NPG) containing both macro-and mesopores is reported using electrochemical alloying and dealloying processes to engineer a bicontinuous solid/void morphology. Scanning electron microscopy (color SEM) images depict the hierarchical pore structure created after the multistep synthesis with an ensemble of tiny pores below 100 nm in size located in ligaments spanning larger pores of several hundred nanometers. Smaller-sized pores are exploited for surface modification, and the network of larger pores aids in molecular transport. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to compare the electrochemically active surface area of the hierarchical bimodal structure with that of the regular unimodal NPG with an emphasis on the critical role of both dealloying and annealing in creating the desired structure. The adsorption of different proteins was followed using UV-vis absorbance measurements of solution depletion revealing the high loading capacity of hb-NPG. The surface coverage of lipoic acid on the hb-NPG was analyzed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and reductive desorption. The roughness factor determinations suggest that the fabricated hb-NPG electrode has tremendous potential for biosensor development by changing the scaling relations between volume and surface area which may lead to improved analytical performance. We have chosen to take advantage of the surface architectures of hb-NPG due to the presence of a large specific surface area for functionalization and rapid transport pathways for faster response. It is shown that the hb-NPG electrode has a higher sensitivity for the amperometric detection of glucose than does an NPG electrode of the same geometric surface area.",Alexei V Demchenko (Role:Author); Palak Sondhi (Role:Graduate Student Researcher); Dharmendra Neupane (Role:Graduate Student Researcher); Jay K Bhattarai (Role:Author); Keith J Stine (Role:Author),,,Blind Peer Reviewed,International,Research Board,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Lead / Corresponding author,NIH NIGMS (GM111835),,,,English,,Self-reported,

This dynamical phenomenon has recently been studied in computational models and demonstrated experimentally in mechanical, optical, and chemical systems. The theoretical basis of these states is currently under active investigation. Chimera behavior is of particular relevance in the context of neural synchronization, given the phenomenon of unihemispheric sleep and the recent observation of asymmetric sleep in human patients with sleep apnea. The similarity of neural chimera states to neural ""bump"" states, which have been suggested as a model for working memory and visual orientation tuning in the cortex, adds to their interest as objects of study. Chimera states have been demonstrated in the FitzHugh-Nagumo model of excitable cells and in the Hindmarsh-Rose neural model. Here, we demonstrate chimera states and chimera-like behaviors in a Hodgkin-Huxley-type model of thermally sensitive neurons both in a system with Abrams-Strogatz (mean field) coupling and in a system with Kuramoto (distance-dependent) coupling. We map the regions of parameter space for which chimera behavior occurs in each of the two coupling schemes.",Sonya Bahar; Scott Lewis; Ter A Glaze,,,,International,None,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Lead / Corresponding author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

The algorithm proposes an innovative abstract representation along with newly designed domain-specific genetic operators. We then analyze the performance of the algorithm using popular real-world data sets taken from multiple domains. The impact of different initialization methods for the population, along with varying migration and elitism methods are studied. The analysis demonstrates that our algorithm consistently finds high quality or even optimal solutions without any a priori knowledge of the network or the desired number of clusters. Furthermore, we compare our results with five previously published methods and yield the highest quality for the largest of the benchmark datasets. Finally, we present our analysis of biological networks representing genetic variants and gene expression levels for individuals with and without late-onset Alzheimer disease and gene expression for individuals before, during, and after influenza infection.

Our study investigates the global integration strategies of Taiwanese small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) competing in the global information technology (IT) industry. It confirms the importance of some structural forces (i.e., economies of scale and standard market demands) in the global integration strategies of Taiwanese SMEs thereby expanding the applicability of existent internationalization theories developed primarily in the context of large Western MNCs to non-Western SMEs. This study finds three results that add new knowledge to the current SME literature and provides managerial implications. First, it finds a negative relationship between competitive actions and business unit integration. Second, it finds that in the optimally globalized IT industry there is no direct effect of business unit integration on performance. Third, it finds a direct effect of differential comparative advantage on performance.",,,,,,,,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,,,FAS and other legacy systems,

Two waves of single-respondent data were collected from the same U.S. multinational corporations (MNCs) in 1993 and 2003.  These data are used to test hypotheses that internationalization affects how successfully a U.S. MNC manages its relationships with social and political stakeholders in its non-market environment.  The results of this unique study indicate that the number of countries in which the MNC operates and its percentages of foreign employees, foreign assets, and foreign sales are associated with the public affairs strategies that MNCs use in non-market environments.  The study differentiates these strategies into social or political buffering and social or political bridging.  Significant differences exist across the two time periods in the impact of percentage of foreign employees on social buffering and the impact of political buffering on political affairs performance. The study elaborates the implications of these findings.",Julius H. Johnson; Dinesh A. Mirchandani; Martin B.

Three buildings were built and another is planned. We interviewed 26 stakeholders in the partnership using grounded theory and social network theory. The emergent themes and regional economic and value-added benefits of the partnership and the strategic management implications have helped clarify the potential and natural fit of the economic development mission for an urban university.  The partnership cuts across all areas: the student experience through internships and employment, the donor relationships, and the faculty relationships as measured through research and class projects. A recent economic impact study found that Express Scripts generates about $1 billion in economic benefits for Missouri each year and will produce $10.5 billion in economic benefits over the next decade for the Saint Louis area and Missouri.

Julius,Johnson,Ownership Mix in Franchise System: A Revisit and New Perspectives on the Dynamic Impacts of Franchisor Age and Size,Journal of Management,1/1/2013,2013.0,,,,,Submitted,,,,,Spring,2013,"This empirical study examines the impacts of franchisor size and age on the ownership mix of franchise systems. The authors ground their predictions in both resource scarcity perspective and agency theory. Using a four-year secondary data from 658 franchisors operating in fifteen industries, they demonstrated that the effects of franchisor size and age on ownership mix differ when examined at the overall level and the incremental level. Specifically, the relationships between the overall proportion of franchised outlets and franchisor size and age are inverted U-shaped, i.e., the overall proportion of franchised outlets grows when franchisors are young and small, stays flat when franchisors are at the mediate level, and eventually declines when franchisors approach maturity. In contrast, the relationship is U-shaped when checked at the incremental level. The study offers a new and integrated perspective to resolve inconsistencies in the literature regarding the dynamic impacts of franchisor characteristics on franchise system. Although the resource scarcity theory explains the influence of franchisor size and age on the overall proportion of franchised outlets, the influence on the incremental change of franchised proportion can be better accounted for by the combination of agency theory and resource scarcity framework.

The key findings of this study based on a survey of chief executives of 351 Taiwanese IT firms confirms the presence of three structural determinants in the industry, i.e., economies of scale, differences in comparative advantage across countries, and standardized market demand across countries. The study finds that economies of scale and standardized market demands are related to business unit integration of SMEs in the global IT industry in Taiwan. It further determines that differences in comparative advantage between countries influences performance of SMEs in the global IT industry in Taiwan while the integration of business units does not. In summary, the study provides additional empirical evidence and managerial insights into the issues of internationalization and the value of existing international business theories developed with large firms to explain the global integration strategies of SMEs competing in a global industry in a developing country market.","Johnson Jr.; Bindu Arya; A.

It investigates how firms in this industry fit their strategies to their strategic orientations to sustain competitive advantages.  A survey of chief executives of 351 Taiwanese firms confirmed the presence of industry pressures driving firms towards the local responsiveness, multifocal, and global integration strategic orientations. The industry pressures predicted six different competitive strategies (conservative cost control, quality reputation, complex innovation, marketing differentiation, premium positioning and breadth) as proposed by prior research. The major finding of this study is that the strategic dimension of complex innovation has a dominant affect on competitive dynamics and organizational performance in this industry. Other competitive strategies while important were not as critical to success in a fast cycle industry.",Julius H. Johnson; Dinesh A.

Both perspectives have been applied in the study of a fundamentally important manifestation of social control: police use of deadly force.  Consensus theories predict that police use of deadly force should be related to normative violations and unrelated to community racial or class composition.  Conflict theories predict the opposite.  Limitations of prior research, however, preclude sound theoretical conclusions regarding police use of deadly force.  The current study presents a micro-spatial analysis of police shootings in St. Louis neighborhoods between 2003 and 2012.  The results generally favor the consensus perspective: police shootings are more frequent in neighborhoods with high levels of violent crime and are unrelated to neighborhood racial composition or economic disadvantage, net violent crime.  The study also reveals a curvilinear association between police shootings and violent crime that is not easily explained by either consensus or conflict theories and should be investigated in future micro-ecological research.

Using large truck crash data from 2013 through 2015 obtained from the Missouri State Highway Patrol, chi-square automatic interaction detection (CHAID) decision trees were estimated to examine the effect of AV and CV technologies on motor carrier crash severity. Results suggest that the greatest contributory predictors of crash severity outcomes are driving too fast for conditions, distracted/inattentive driving, overcorrecting, and driving under the influence of alcohol. If these circumstances are altered by AV and CV technologies, it is suggested that between 117 and 193 severe crashes involving large trucks could be prevented annually in Missouri alone. 
To render such safety benefits, key vehicle needs include autonomously controlling acceleration and steering, monitoring of the environment, and responding to dynamic driving environments without the need for human intervention. Importantly, the safe operations of a system that can perform such AV and CV tasks require readable lane markings, traffic signals and signs, managed or dedicated lane usage, and dedicated refueling and/or recharging facilities.

The original intent of the program was to maintain some level of air service to rural communities that would otherwise not have any. The Rural Survival Act of 1996 established the permanence of the EAS program fueled by the idea that reliable air services are vital to local rural economies. This idea is somewhat challenged in recent research studies that found little to no economic impacts of air traffic.
This project entertained the theory that intercity traffic volume, and not air traffic volume alone, is what affects economic outcomes of certain geographical areas. A cost-benefit analysis of substituting subsidized air service with a subsidized ground service is presented and concludes that an intercity ground service network can create substantial cost savings on both a per round trip and round trip-seat basis.",Ray A Mundy; Ken Bau,Yes,Applied or Integration/Application Scholarship,Editorially Reviewed,National,Research Council,Research Project Report,No,Funded Research Project Report,Lead / Corresponding author,DTRT13-G-UTC37 ,,,,English,,Self-reported,
Ray,Mundy,Asset Utilization Potential of Building a Trucking and Rail Intermodal Hub in the St. Louis Region,Research Project Report funded by the U.S. Department of Transportation Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology,,2018.0,,,,http://www.intrans.iastate.edu,Completed/Published,,,,,Summer,2018,"Annually, more than one billion tons of cargo pass through St. Louis, Missouri, making it the “Gateway to the West,” as termed by the Missouri Economic Research and Information Center. In Missouri, 33% of all cargo traffic moves by railroad, and more than 60% is transported by truck. As trade continues to flourish in the region, there is increased shipper and carrier demand for making St. Louis an intermodal hub in order to optimize the region’s strategic location, increase profit, and lower transportation costs. 
The objective of this study was to assess the asset utilization potential of building a trucking and rail intermodal hub in the St. Louis region by looking at industry history, examining transportation policies and initiatives in the St. Louis region, and evaluating the major stakeholders affected by intermodal initiatives. Because today’s transportation development decisions greatly impact environmental and economic sustainability, in addition to community welfare, the research project also focused on whether a common intermodal hub in St. Louis would minimize trucking and railroad operational and economic costs. The topics of property rights, externalities, net benefit to society, and technological growth are discussed in this research project. Case studies of other cities in the United States that have had success with intermodal development are also presented in this report. 
The primary methodology for this project focused on geospatial mapping of providers in the St. Louis region. This information was used to provide a detailed analysis of the creation of a railroad and trucking hub in St. Louis to facilitate the interaction of intermodal trade. 
The study explained the primary benefit of reducing intercity transfer costs to showcase the benefits and limitations associated with a common intermodal hub expansion in the St. Louis region. The authors concluded that the benefits outweigh any negatives and proposed the ideal location of the intermodal hub in St. Louis.

Therefore, airports must find a way to counterbalance the revenue losses created by these changes. One such solution has been on the rise in the united kingdom. With airport drop-off and pick-up charges, private vehicles must pay for the convenience of loading or unloading passengers at the airport entrance.

Ray,Mundy,Paving the Way for Autonomous and Connected Vehicle Technologies in the Motor Carrier and Rail Industries,Published as Funded Research Report by U.S. Department of Transportation Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology,3/18/2018,2018.0,,,,http://www.intrans.iastate.edu/research/documents/research-reports/emerging_freight_truck_technologies_w_cvr.pdf,Completed/Published,,,,,Spring,2018,"This research sought to evaluate the broad impacts that automated and connected vehicle technologies can have on both the motor carrier and rail industries. The studies look at potential safety considerations and infrastructure needs that will be required to support the mass adoption of these emerging technologies, as well as the potential costs and benefits as they come into the market.
Using large truck crash data from 2013 through 2015 obtained from the Missouri State Highway Patrol, chi-square automatic interaction detection (CHAID) decision trees were estimated to examine the effect of autonomous vehicle (AV) and connected vehicle (CV) technologies on motor carrier crash severity. Results suggest that the greatest contributory predictors of crash severity outcomes are driving too fast for conditions, distracted/inattentive driving, overcorrecting, and driving under the influence of alcohol. If these circumstances are altered by AV and CV technologies, it is suggested that between 117 and 193 severe crashes involving large trucks could be prevented annually in Missouri alone. To render such safety benefits, key vehicle needs include autonomously controlling acceleration and steering, monitoring of the environment, and responding to dynamic driving environments without the need for human intervention. Importantly, the safe operations of a system that can perform such AV and CV tasks require readable lane markings, traffic signals and signs, managed or dedicated lane usage, and dedicated refueling and/or recharging facilities.
Further, since the development and adoption of these technologies are likely to be gradual, three phases of adoption were posited and analyzed. Depending on the degree of autonomy that is available, the motor carrier industry could achieve up to a 42.1% reduction in average cost per mile. And if fully autonomous technology was made available for use in the motor carrier industry, it is estimated that the American rail freight industry could see a 19% to 45% drop in demand.",Ray A Mundy; Ken Bau,Yes,Applied or Integration/Application Scholarship,Editorially Reviewed,National,Research Board,Research Report,No,Research Report,Lead / Corresponding author,USDOT/DTRT13-G-UTC37,,,,English,,Self-reported,

These issues and questions center on the introduction of transportation network companies (TNCs) into the supply of taxi and taxi-type trip providers. Therefore, this study also addresses these questions and provides comprehensive recommendations.

Ray,Mundy,WHY TNCs WILL BE REGULATED LIKE TAXIS–  HISTORICALLY SPEAKING ,Research Report Funded by U.S. Department of Transportation Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology,,2018.0,,,,http://www.intrans.iastate.edu,Completed/Published,,,,,Spring,2018,"With the advent of transportation network companies, or TNCs, as they are labeled by the state of California, there has been considerable discussion, legislative action, and lawsuits regarding their attempts to operate without being subject to local taxi, sedan, limousine, or private-for-hire regulations. Indeed, across almost every continent, Uber has attempted to simply disregard local city and airport rules and regulations established for all commercial ground passenger transportation carriers. Uber argues that it is not a transportation company but rather a technology company, and so by definition it is not subject to commercial vehicle regulations. As a result, fierce and expensive legal and legislative battles have been bitterly fought. However, these legal proceedings rarely address just why there are regulations for commercial vehicles and their drivers. 
It is therefore incumbent upon public officials to learn from this phenomenon and design a taxi system that provides drivers a fair income opportunity and maximum utilization from vehicles, to offer and maintain a high level of service at reasonable rates to residents and visitors alike. A best guess is that the industry will experience a form of hybrid taxi/TNC type transportation firm that offers both services in competition with national TNC brands for a while, but that ultimately there will be re-regulation and TNCs will be included within the local regulatory framework. There may be an opportunity for statewide or even national taxi/TNC regulations, but as in the past, drivers will be vetted, entry will be restricted, and public safety in the form of commercial liability insurance for all drivers will be standard requirements.

Boyce, Ray A. Mundy, (2017) ""Practice or lip service: exploring collaboration perspectives in purchasing"", IMP Journal, Vol. 11 Issue: 3, pp.452-467.",Completed/Published,,,,,Summer,2017,"The purpose of this paper is to convey a sample of current collaboration perspectives in purchasing. The purchasing function has a critical role to play in collaborative relationships since it is a key facet of any given supply chain. These relationships may be beneficial when coordinated actions benefit buyers, suppliers, and the entire supply chain more than the uncoordinated efforts of individual firms. Despite the commonly reported benefits that can be gained in close relationships, recent research has indicated that collaboration attempts between firms in supply chains have not been as widespread as anticipated.
Design/methodology/approach

This research investigates the progress the purchasing function has made in achieving collaborative supply chain relationships. Input is gained from purchasing professionals via semi-structured interviews of procurement professionals. Grounded theory is used to deduct key themes from the interviews.
Findings

Results from a small sample size of nine interviews indicate that collaboration in purchasing has not yet reached the theoretical ideal, and it is suggested that key issues such as trust still do not exist at levels that would be appropriate to support collaborative relationships.
Research limitations/implications

This paper can be used as a basis to support further analysis that may broaden the scope of input from purchasing professionals. It is also difficult to draw generalizations from an interview method, and the sampling technique utilized limited the pool of potential interviewees to a sample size of nine semi-structured interviews.
Practical implications

This paper provides insights that purchasing professionals and those that deal with them can consider when engaging in supply chain relationships. It provides potential insights into where the purchasing function stands in its use of a collaborative strategy.
Originality/value

This paper focuses specifically on how the purchasing function is utilizing collaboration by gathering input from purchasing professionals. This practical viewpoint provides a realistic perspective that complements previous research on collaboration.",Ray A Mundy,Yes,Basic or Discovery Scholarship,Blind Peer Reviewed,National,None,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Co-author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Most successes tend to result from the collaboration itself and lead to each sector’s common triumph: government stability through a reduced dependency on public subsidies and increased private innovation.

Therefore, airports must find a way to counterbalance the revenue losses created by these changes. One such solution has been on the rise in Great Britain. With airport drop-off and pick-up charges, private vehicles must pay for the convenience of loading or unloading passengers at the airport entrance. Not only does this practice have the potential to generate millions of dollars in annual revenue, but it also offers a remedy for other maladies such as congestion and safety issues on airport roads. This paper examines the effects the drop-off and pick-up charges have had in Great Britain and explores what US airports might expect should they too adopt the practice.",Ray A Mundy,No,Basic or Discovery Scholarship,Editorially Reviewed,National,Research Board,Article,No,Journal-Trade,Lead / Corresponding author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

The postcard image for Basil Kincaid's ""Gates,"" which runs February 24-May 15 at Gallery 210.

Basil Kincaid’s work is as urgent as it is familiar. His paintings, drawings, photographs, and found-object pieces mark out space in the world and examine it from a deeply personal and activist perspective.

This weekend, his latest solo exhibition, Basil Kincaid: Gates opens at the University of Missouri–St. Louis’ 210 Gallery.

The dimensional and site-specific installations use familiar textiles, such as quilts and clothing, as well as found and donated objects. They’re arranged into evocative objects that interrogate their settings—literal settings but also cultural and interpersonal settings.

“I’m looking at the quilts as their own beings,” Kincaid says by phone, in a van on the way to help another artist move studios. “They introduce themselves.”

They introduce themselves, and then the conversation sets off between the work and the viewer. But don’t expect much direction from the artist. Come with an open mind, and bring yourself fully to the conversation.

“Coming to an understanding around a work of art is a collaborative process,” says Kincaid. “That’s why I like leaving the interpretation fairly open. Come without an expectation, and receive it in whatever way you receive it.”

Basil Kincaid, ""Uncle Lord"" (2018). Silk,Cotton, Velvet, Wool, Corduroy, Lace and Thread. Dimensions Variable.

The gates in the title refer to passageways that we move through to understand ourselves, he says. “Materially, I’m using the quilt as a metaphor for some of these passageways, connections with the spirit realm and ancestral energies. You’ll see some symbolism with these windows—the eyes are the windows to the soul.”

Gallery 210 director Terry Suhre describes the work as warm and generous. “He looks to his past, his ancestral past, as an example that guides us all to our own path,” Suhre says. “He shows us the way to move back and really explore carefully who we are and gives us a model of how to share that with the rest of the world.”

Kincaid's latest work reflects a turning point in his life and in his practice: stepping through some gates of his own. “Over the past few years, it’s been this big journey of learning how to love myself and face all these things in my life that it was uncomfortable to face,” he says. “I have, in the past, been a lot more selfish.”

Kincaid says he’s realized that he hurt people in his life without intention. He’s been unpacking that and trying to expand his view into greater selflessness. It wasn’t a specific internal or external event that motivated him to change but rather his intrinsic interest in growth for its own sake.

It’s easy to hide out in ourselves, he says. “The past few years have been focused on not doing that—just looking at how my process of healing myself can inspire somebody else to embark on their own healing. And how can we also create spaces, physically and conversationally, where people can engage with their tenderness and begin to engage with each other on a deeper, more meaningful level?”

He’s been learning more about himself and his work through interactions and conversations with other artists, and that mirroring and exchange has led to greater depth, he says.

“My art is how I understand myself and where I am in relation to other people,” Kincaid says. “You can only do better when you know better.”

Basil Kincaid: Gates runs February 24–May 15. It opens with a lecture from 4–5 p.m. and a reception from 5–7 p.m. Gallery 210, University of Missouri-St. Louis, 1 University, 44 Arnold Grobman.

Two embedded, entwined, and exceptional American institutions—broad private property rights and competitive federalism—are necessary for explaining this shift. These two institutions shaped the exceptional stringency of 1970s American environmental laws and the powerful backlash against these laws that continues today. American colonies ensured broad private rights to use land and natural resources for profit. The colonies and the independent state governments that followed wielded expansive authority to govern this commodified environment. In the 1780s, Congress underwrote state governance of the privatized environment by directing the parceling and transfer of federal land to private parties and of environmental governance to future states. The 1787 Constitution cemented these relationships and exposed states to interstate economic competition. Environmental laws of the 1970s imposed unprecedented challenges to the environmental prerogatives long protected by these institutions, and the beneficiaries responded with a wide-ranging counterattack. Federalism enabled this opposition to build powerful regional alliances to stymie action on climate change. These overlooked institutional factors are necessary to explain why Canadian and American environmental policies have diverged.",David B Robertson,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,International,,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Lead / Corresponding author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

These efficient P-C bond-forming reactions have become the cornerstone of methods for the synthesis of alpha-hydroxyphosphonates and, by numerous available substitution reactions, the synthesis of other alpha-and gamma-substituted phosphonates and phosphonic acids. Much of the interest in alpha- and gamma-substituted phosphonates and phosphonic acids has been stimulated by reports of their biological activity, which is often dependent upon their absolute and relative stereochemistry. In this chapter, we review diastereoselective and enantioselective additions of dialkyl phosphites to aldehydes and ketones, otherwise called the phospho-aldol, Pudovik or Abramov reactions.

In the shape of invisible barriers, it defines spaces while simultaneously shaping their lighting, noise, and climate conditions. Despite these unique architectural qualities, little is known regarding the human experience with glass barriers. Is a material that has been described as being simultaneously there and not there from an architectural perspective, actually there and/or not there from perceptual, behavioral, and social points of view? In this article, we review systematic observations and experimental studies that explore the impact of transparent barriers on human cognition and action. In doing so, the importance of empirical and multidisciplinary approaches to inform the use of glass in contemporary architecture is highlighted and key questions for future inquiry are identified.

The latter in particular promises novel versions of these sports which involve the same forces and ball-energies, but take place in slower \bullet-time"" with enhanced momentum-effects (as well as augmented leaping-skills for the players). One immediate spin-off of this is the possibility of passing around in class both \Moon"" and \Mars"" baseballs, which weigh the same in their intended domains as does a baseball or cricket-ball on earth, to give students a visceral sense of the need for separate units to keep track of mass and of weight, as well how life on neighboring worlds feels.",Philip Fraundorf,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,National,None,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Lead / Corresponding author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Philip,Fraundorf,The rates of unlayered graphene formation in a supercooled carbon melt at low pressure. ,MRS Advances,,,,,,,Completed/Published,,,,,Spring,2023,"Elemental carbon has important structural diversity, ranging from nanotubes to graphite and diamond. Studies of primitive meteorite extracted micron-size core/rim carbon spheres suggest they formed via the solidification of condensed carbon-vapor droplets, followed by gas-to-solid carbon coating to form the graphite rims. We show here how analytical models of reaction limited nucleation & growth can be used to connect thermal history (e.g. time at temperature) to electron microscope observations of mean graphene sheet size and number density. Atomistic models using the LCBOP semi-empirical potential show promise for estimating latent heat and the temperature-dependence of barrier heights, which are not yet incorporated in the model. We also show that growth of 2D clusters from a 2D liquid takes place more rapidly than from a 3D liquid, which with suitable scaling might open the door to simulating growth over millisecond time scales in the study of liquid carbon’s solidification at low pressures.",Philip Fraundorf; Chathuri Silve; Phil Chrostoski,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,International,Research Board,Presentation paper,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Co-author,NASA-Missouri SpaceGrant Consortium,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Alternative teacher certification programs have increased the numbers going into teaching, but no firm evidence has proven they remain longer.

A mixed-integer linear programming model is developed by explicitly accounting for various real-world complexities, such as nonstationary demand, arbitrary review period, and limited inventory budget. We apply the model to a 900-SKU experiment and observe an average 7.5% improvement in profit over the traditional ABC approach. A real-world application for a cheese manufacturer provides a nearly 3% improvement in company's profit with a 13% reduction in inventory capital compared to its current eight-class multi-criteria inventory classification scheme. Comprehensive computational experiments are performed to examine the individual and interactive effects of various parameters on the inventory performance. Results show that it is critical for a company to manage its inventory both dynamically in the face of nonstationary demand and holistically by integrating SKU classification and policy setting. Our work provides a practical decision-support tool that simultaneously optimizes multi-period inventory classification and control decisions under nonstationary demand. It contributes to the inventory management literature by bridging two distinct streams of inventory research, inventory classification and inventory optimization, within a practical inventory modeling framework.

James,Campbell,Improving Order Fulfillment Performance through Integrated Inventory Management in a Multi-Item Finished Goods System,Journal of Business Logistics,,2020.0,41,54-66,1,,Completed/Published,,,,,Summer,2020,"Effective inventory management is fundamental to order fulfillment excellence and supply chain success. In this paper, we develop a strategic inventory management decision tool that integrates inventory classification and inventory control policy decisions for maximizing order fulfillment performance, while accounting for a constraint on inventory budget and the profit expectation of a firm. This inventory solution tool provides critical enhancements to current inventory planning software, which is developed upon the traditional inventory classification scheme and where practitioners have to balance service levels and safety stock decisions through trial-and-error. The model allows firms to assess whether the current inventory performance is Pareto optimal, quantify the trade-offs between various performance measures, and identify the right inventory level according to the firms' strategic goals. In computational results, we demonstrate the trade-off and positive relationships between key item- and order-based inventory performance measures and short-term profitability under different levels of inventory budget in a multi-item finished goods inventory system.",James F Campbell; Liu Yang; Haitao Li,No,Basic or Discovery Scholarship,"Non-blind, Peer Reviewed",,,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

However, cyanobacteria are the only prokaryotic group for which bona fide circadian properties have been persuasively documented, even though homologs of the cyanobacterial kaiABC central clock genes are distributed widely among Eubacteria and Archaea. We report the purple non-sulfur bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris (that harbors homologs of kaiB and kaiC) only poorly sustains rhythmicity in constant conditions-a defining characteristic of circadian rhythms. Moreover, the biochemical characteristics of the Rhodopseudomonas homolog of the KaiC protein in vivo and in vitro are different from those of cyanobacterial KaiC. Nevertheless, R. palustris cells exhibit adaptive kaiC-dependent growth enhancement in 24-h cyclic environments, but not under non-natural constant conditions. Therefore, our data indicate that Rhodopseudomonas does not have a classical circadian rhythm, but a novel timekeeping mechanism that does not sustain itself in constant conditions. These results question the adaptive value of self-sustained oscillatory capability for daily timekeepers and establish new criteria for circadian-like systems that are based on adaptive properties (i.e., fitness enhancement in rhythmic environments), rather than upon observations of persisting rhythms in constant conditions. We propose that the Rhodopseudomonas system is a ""proto"" circadian timekeeper, as in an ancestral system that is based on KaiC and KaiB proteins and includes some, but not necessarily all, of the canonical properties of circadian clocks. These data indicate reasonable intermediate steps by which bona fide circadian systems evolved in simple organisms.",Peijun Ma; Teresa Thiel; Carl Hirschie Johnson; Tetsuya Mori; Chi Zhao,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The heterocyst-specific nitrogenase encoded by the large nif1 gene cluster and the similar nif2 gene cluster that functions under anaerobic conditions in vegetative cells are under the control of the promoter for the first gene of each cluster, nifB1 or nifB2, respectively. Associated with each of these clusters is a putative regulatory gene called cnfR (patB) whose product has a C-terminal HTH domain and an N- terminal ferredoxin-like domain. CnfR1 activates nifB1 expression in heterocysts, while CnfR2 activates nifB2 expression. A cnfR1 mutant was unable to make nitrogenase under aerobic conditions in heterocysts while the cnfR2 mutant was unable to make nitrogenase under anaerobic conditions. Mutations in cnfR1 and cnfR2 reduced transcripts for the nif1 and nif2 genes, respectively. The closely related cyanobacterium, Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 has the nif1 system but lacks nif2. Expression of nifB2:lacZ from A. variabilis in anaerobic vegetative cells of Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 depended on the presence of cnfR2. This suggests that CnfR2 is necessary and sufficient for activation of the nifB2 promoter and that the CnfR1/CnfR2 family of proteins are the primary activators of nitrogenase gene expression in cyanobacteria.

This research considers the determinants of competitive dynamics, equity, and path dependency on TIF use. The authors use logistic and ordinary least-squares regressions on the approval, number, and value of TIFs in Missouri to flesh out the waythe determinants contribute to TIF approval, value, and frequency of use. They find that there are competitive dynamics thataffect TIF use: Being adjacent to another city that uses TIF increases the likelihood that a city will approve a TIF. The study finds evidence that TIF adoption patterns contribute to intermunicipal inequality, and provides some support for the importance of path dependency in TIF use.

The Multisectoral Framework on Regional Aid for Large Investment Projects, now incorporated into the Regional Aid Guidelines, provides for reduced aid maxima for projects over 50 million. This paper shows that the Multisectoral Framework has largely accomplished its goals: aid award levels have fallen significantly since the reform of the Framework in 2002, and in comparison with the unregulated location tournaments of the U.S., aid packages are smaller in the EU.

Straight-forward variation and predictive tests are constructed to determine signs of unusual market volatility behavior during the 2016 election period. The results reveal strong evidence of unusual volatility behavior, pocked by frequent periods of abnormal returns.

The theoretical benefits of VIX have provided invaluable insight into the behavior of volatility but the attempts to create a tradable alternative have failed. This paper rejects the notion that VIX-products are related to the VIX, rejects the misnomer index, in favor of statistic, rejects the idea of the VIX-statistic as a separate asset class and rejects the VIX as a measure of fear. Instead, VIX-products are by design between 6-16 times removed from the VIX-statistic.
Using daily data from inception, the VIX is first tested as a predictor for the actual 30-day forward volatility of the S&P 500 Stock Index. Subsequent tests are based on hypotheses of equality between movements in VIX and selected VIX-products to changes in the S&P 500 Stock Index. The specific products studied are: VIX Futures 1-month roll, VIXM, VIXY, VIIX, VXX and VXZ. The VIXM and VIXY funds comprise the ETF group, while VIIX, VXX and VXZ notes represent the ETN group. The findings show that VIX is a poor predictor of SPFV and VIX-products exhibit large, significant differences from the VIX-stat.

The article is designed to identify universals of literary meaning. M. H. Abrams’s four constituents of the literary situation (author, reader, world, text) serve as ""meta-universals""--conditions without which no other universals could exist. The author identifies four levels for the organization of meaning in literary texts: pan-human, culturally specific, individual persons, and individual literary works. Literature is defined as aesthetically modeled verbal constructs that depict or evoke subjective experience. Meaning is analyzed in three categories: subject themes, emotional tone, and aesthetic form. Literary texts are identified as contributions to imaginative virtual worlds occupied by all persons. The author argues that imagination is the last major component needed for an adequate basic model of the adapted mind.

Here are the abstract and keywords:

Biocultural theory is an integrative research program designed to investigate the causal interactions between biological adaptations and cultural constructions. From the biocultural perspective, cultural processes are rooted in the biological necessities of the human life cycle: specifically human forms of birth, growth, survival, mating, parenting, and sociality. Conversely, from the biocultural perspective, human biological processes are constrained, organized, and developed by culture, which includes technology, culturally specific socioeconomic and political structures, religious and ideological beliefs, and artistic practices such as music, dance, painting, and storytelling. Establishing biocultural theory as a program that self-consciously encompasses the different particular forms of human evolutionary research could help scholars and scientists envision their own specialized areas of research as contributions to a coherent, collective research program. This article argues that a mature biocultural paradigm needs to be informed by at least 7 major research clusters: (a) gene-culture coevolution; (b) human life history theory; (c) evolutionary social psychology; (d) anthropological research on contemporary hunter-gatherers; (e) biocultural socioeconomic and political history; (f) evolutionary aesthetics; and (g) biocultural research in the humanities (religions, ideologies, the history of ideas, and the arts). This article explains the way these research clusters are integrated in biocultural theory, evaluates the level of development in each cluster, and locates current biocultural theory within the historical trajectory of the social sciences and the humanities.

Notwithstanding the courageousness of its citizens who put their safety at risk and speak up for change, Honduras has often failed to protect human rights defenders and has personally commissioned punishment through its own means. In violation of numerous articles of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, the Honduran government uses its criminal justice system as a mechanism to silence those who speak up against it through unfair criminal charges, detention, and convictions, while at the same time fail to condemn private companies or individuals who retaliate against the work of human rights defenders with lawsuits, violence, or murder. This paper discusses the recent narrative of the “Guapinol Eight,” a group of men who were wrongly arrested, detained, and convicted by a Honduran court after legitimately defending their right to clean water. The situation of the Guapinol Eight is juxtaposed to previous instances of mistreatment to present how the continuing toxic treatment of human rights defenders in Honduras jeopardizes the existence of human rights throughout the country. At the conclusion of this paper, recommendations are made as to steps the Honduran government can take to redress past wrongs and introduce standards that comply with the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders before a chilling effect washes away the voice of human rights in Honduras in the years to come. </em>",Lauren Sulliven (Role:Author); Richard T Middleton IV (Role:Author),,,Blind Peer Reviewed,International,None,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Co-author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

However, research highlights a critical disparity in firearm-related deaths by race. Researchers often cite implicit bias as a contributing factor for the racial disparity in firearm-related deaths. In an effort to provide a foundation for potential social work interventions, the present study will test implicit biases towards four racial and ethnic groups (White, Black, Asian, Hispanic/Latino), fear of crime, and the quantity and quality of interactions with neighbors of a different race as predictors of gun ownership. Findings suggest that implicit bias towards Black, Asian, and Hispanic/Latino individuals is a significant predictor of gun ownership. Fear of crime and more frequent interactions with neighbors of a different race are also significant predictors of gun ownership. Taken as a whole, findings suggest that gun owners are more likely to be more vigilant towards people of color because of stereotypical assumptions that racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to be involved with crime. Social work practice and policy implications include developing interventions aimed at reducing implicit bias and identifying policies that are associated with lower levels of implicit bias among gun owners.</p>",Michael Gearhart; Courtney Jones; Sharon D Johnson; Kristen A Berg,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,,,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,"60%: Writing, analysis, editing, revisions",,,English,,Self-reported,
Sharon,Johnson,Guns and intimate partner violence among adolescents: A scoping review,Journal of Family Violence,8/14/2021,2020.0,36,605-617,,,Completed/Published,10.1007/s10896-020-00193-x,,,,Fall,2020,"<p>Purpose: Intimate partner violence (IPV) among adolescents, or teen dating violence (TDV), is a significant public health issue that may affect up to two-thirds of youth aged 12–18. Gun violence among adolescents is similarly high, accounting for 18.7% of all firearm injuries from 2010 to 2016. Despite these statistics and evidence showing that TDV continues into adulthood as IPV, gun-related TDV has not received the same level of attention as adult IPV. In this scoping review, we are guided by the following questions: (1) what are the known risk and protective factors for gun-related TDV across micro (individual, interpersonal), mezzo (school, neighborhood), and macro (policy, social norms) domains? (2) What are the future directions for this area of research? Methods: We conducted a scoping review of eight academic databases to identify peer-reviewed studies examining risk and protective factors for gun-related TDV published in 1999–2019. Results: Our search returned few unique results (N = 16). Most of the published studies described the shared individual risk factors of gun carrying/access and TDV. Mezzo studies discussed TDV within the context of peer aggression or youth delinquency and gun carrying. There were zero macro studies meeting our search parameters. Conclusion: Our review suggests that adolescence may confer a unique blend of risk factors for both firearm and relationship violence, yet the intersection of these issues has received relatively little attention compared to gun violence in adult relationships. Areas for future inquiry involve increased surveillance of this issue and interventions addressing the shared risks for gun carrying/access and TDV.

Nasser,Arshadi,Real Estate Intermediation and Blockchain ,Real Estate Review ,,2019.0,47,,Number 3,,Completed/Published,,,,,Spring,2019,"Modern financial intermediaries exist with the promise that they can produce information cheaper, faster, and safer in order to mitigate the information asymmetry problem between suppliers and demanders of capital. Information production, therefore, is at the heart of financial intermediation. Over time, however, financial intermediation has become costly and marred with incentive problems of its own. For example, some financial intermediaries have committed fraud by timing their trades ahead of their customer, others by misquoting interest rates, and a few by fleecing customers through issuing unwanted credit cards. Regulators in charge of protecting customers often appear to be one- step behind in preempting the regulated intermediaries from wrongdoing.
Advances in computing technology and cryptography have led to the development of new and promising tools in addressing problems faced in financial intermediation. One such technology is the blockchain. 
The blockchain uses computer science, cryptography, and hashing as the base technologies in its development. It is a software that provides for the exchange of information, messages, and assets faster, cheaper, and more securely than those in the legacy systems. The blockchain achieves this feat by removing or limiting the role of intermediaries in the exchange process. The blockchain is similar to a digital ledger where multiple transactions are recorded and time-stamped on each block and blocks are linked together to create a blockchain. 
The blockchain is often described either in a highly technical form or through its applications without much discussion of how it works. The former leaves the reader who has no technical background, in the loss, and the latter dissatisfied as if the insights are not complete. This paper addresses these concerns by providing a detailed non-technical discussion on blockchain for those who lack sufficient knowledge of computer science, cryptography, or hashing and then demonstrates how it works in the financial intermediation transactions.    
Applications of the blockchain protocol to the financial intermediation functions include payment systems, wealth management, insurance, and real estate, among many others. This paper focuses on real estate and shows the pros and cons of applying the blockchain technology to its intermediation functions. 
As a complex, multilayered transaction, the real estate legacy system is ripe for significant efficiency improvements in:
•	The establishment of multiple listing services (MLS) that connects buyers, sellers, and brokers with information on the location of the properties, their capital values, property features, and ownership history;  
•	The cost of title insurance that is often expensive, and purchased by buyers, seller, lenders; and 
•	The due diligence required in the documentation for financial, environmental, and legal aspects of the transactions.
This paper evaluates these functions as if they were performed by a blockchain and compares them to the legacy system. It shows that while blockchain improves the efficacy of most the functions in the legacy system, it falls short in others at least in the current regulatory environment.

The PPT1-deficient mouse (Cln1(-/-)) is a useful phenocopy of human INCL. Cln1(-/-) mice display retinal dysfunction, seizures, motor deficits, and die at similar to 8 months of age. However, little is known about the cognitive and behavioral functions of Cln1(-/-) mice during disease progression. In the present study, younger (similar to 1-2 months of age) Cln1(-/-) mice showed minor deficits in motor/sensorimotor functions while older (similar to 5-6 months of age) Cln1(-/-) mice exhibited more severe impairments, including decreased locomotor activity, inferior cued water maze performance, decreased running wheel ability, and altered auditory cue conditioning. Unexpectedly, certain cognitive functions such as some learning and memory capabilities seemed intact in older Cln1(-/-) mice. Younger and older Cln1(-/-) mice presented with walking initiation defects, gait abnormalities, and slowed movements, which are analogous to some symptoms reported in INCL and parkinsonism. However, there was no evidence of alterations in dopaminergic markers in Cln1(-/-) mice. Results from this study demonstrate quantifiable changes in behavioral functions during progression of murine INCL and suggest that Parkinson-like motor/sensorimotor deficits in Cln1(-/-) mice are not mediated by dopamine deficiency.

Wilma,Calvert,Engaging young Black males in reproductive health: A review of the literature,American Journal of Men's Health,,2021.0,15,,6,,Submitted,https://doi.org/10.1177/15579883211062024,,,,Spring,2021,"Young Black males (YBM) ages 18 to 24 years are more at risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and have a substantially greater need for sexual reproductive health (SRH) services than other groups. Despite this significant need, the extant literature does not provide a comprehensive picture of how YBM seek preventive care services (e.g., STI testing). Therefore, the purpose of this review is to address YBM’s SRH access and use of STI/HIV testing and screening in this population, with a specific emphasis on young heterosexual Black males, by identifying barriers and facilitators of engaging with SRH care. An electronic search was performed using Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PsycInfo, PubMed, and Scopus online databases. Keywords were adapted to each database and included variations of “Black males,” “sexual reproductive healthcare services,” “youth (18-24 years old),” and “healthcare access and utilization.” Studies from the review reported that barriers to engaging in SRH care included lack of health insurance, ideas of masculinity that conflict with SRH care, stigma related to accessing services, and lack of knowledge regarding available services and care options. The top facilitators for utilizing SRH care were engagement on behalf of health clinics, confidence gained from social support, access to quality health care in one’s community, and trust in the health care system and providers. This review contributes to the current state of the science and is important to the improvement of high-quality services for this population, including respect, choice in care, confidentially, and compassion.",Rico Ozuna-Harrison (Role:Undergraduate Student Researcher); Daphne Watkins (Role:Author); Caryn R R Rodgers (Role:Author); Kedar Johnson (Role:Undergraduate Student Researcher); Salisha Baranwalt (Role:Undergraduate Student Researcher); Jade C Burns (Role:Author); Jaquetta Reeves (Role:Author); Wilma J Calvert (Role:Author); Mackenzie Adams (Role:Author); Maya J Smith (Role:Author),,,Blind Peer Reviewed,,,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Co-author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Nowhere is this currently more apparent than in the cities of Ferguson and Baltimore. It is not the civil unrest itself, but the resulting rioting and intentional violence that can create a disaster situation. This increases the care burden of health care providers during times when the governmental structure may be overwhelmed or functioning in a less than optimal manner. Beginning with the death of Michael Brown, civil unrest over the last 2 years has necessitated a closer examination of the role nurse leaders play in preparing their staff and facilities for potential results of this civil unrest. The similarities between the results of rioting and violence and natural disaster are obvious, but the differences are significant. Without adequate preparation, providers may not offer the appropriate response. Attention to the 10 ""musts"" for preparedness for civil unrest will facilitate a planning process and provide for a better response and recovery when communities face these issues.",Tener Goodwin Veenema; Wilma J Calvert; Sheila R Grigsby; Roberta Lavin; Jennifer Cobbina,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,,None,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Co-author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,3.0

Since the nineteenth-century, when the territory that is now known as Eritrea was colonized by  Italy in 1890,  Eritrea’s women have been re-imaged in various ways: as ornaments of imperial fascism in the 1930s, as prodigal daughters of the Ethiopian empire in the 1950s, and as tegadelti /“female combatant” i.e., the militant  daughters who ushered in a new era of Eritrean independence, following their participation as combatants in guerrilla warfare against the Ethiopian state  from 1961 to 1991.   Following the United Nations’ sponsored referendum in 1993, which formally recognized Eritrean sovereignty, the war heroine, the tegadal’it of the Eritrean People’s Liberation Forces (EPLF) emerged as the synecdoche of the nation-state. In twenty-first century Eritrea, the militant images of the tegadal’it dominates the official history of the nation, decentering the complex lived-histories of the ethnically, religiously and linguistically diverse women of the nation, whose images had been used to construct power-relations between the inhabitants of the territory and colonial empire-builders, and nationalists seeking federal arrangements or pursuing secession from both imperial and Afro-Marxist rule.    In Eritrea, over a quarter-century of independence, 1993-2019, has produced a palimpsestic gendered narrative that privileges iconic remembrances, that overshadow the lived historical experiences of the multi-ethnic, multi-religious, and multi-faceted women of Eritrea.

The aim of this study is to determine correlates of self-perceived caregiving competence, a positive caregiving outcome, in family caregivers of physically and cognitively impaired older adults. Design: Measures were collected as part of a pre-intervention assessment for a larger intervention study of intergenerational caregivers. Heirarchical linear regression was used to determine the extent to which self-efficacy for controlling upsetting thoughts, caregiver prepardedness and self-reassurance were related to varying levels of self-perceived caregiving competence. Setting: Measures were completed online by the participants. Participants: Participants were 146 women in the United States who provided unpaid care to community-dwelling older adults. Measurements: The main outcome measure was self-perceived competence. Other measures included caregiver annual income and level of education, an analogue caregiver-report version of the Clinical Dementa Rating Scale, number of ADL/IADLs care recipients needed help with, the percentage of care provided by the caregiver, the length of time spent caregiving, Revised Scale for Caregiving Self-Efficacy, the Archbold Preparedness Scale, and the Self-Reassurance Scale. Results: Regression analyses identified self-efficacy for controlling upsetting throughts, caregiver prepardedness, and self-reassurance as significant correlates of self-perceived caregiving competence, when controlling for all other variables. Conclusions: These findings support Crellin et al.’s (2014) model depicting different trajectories for caregiving stressors. Specifically, caregivers can experience positive caring outcomes following a trajectory that includes appraisals and self-efficacy beliefs following challenging caregiving situations.",Emily D Gerstein; Ann Steffen; Kelly A Bergstrom*,,,,,,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Federal Reserve interest rates of 2% to 2.25% aren’t neutral if the inflation rate is 2.61%.

In “Pause Interest-Rate Hikes to Help the Labor Force Grow” (op-ed, Oct. 26), Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari is mistaken in two important ways. Federal Reserve interest rates of 2% to 2.25% aren’t neutral if the inflation rate is 2.61%, as it is as of the third quarter of 2018. This gives a negative real interest rate of at least 0.36%. Only a positive rate of real interest in the 2% to 3% range is “neutral,” as during phases of the high-growth era of the 1980s and 1990s.
The Federal Reserve’s forcing of negative real interest rates for most of the 18 years since 2000, with the exception of about three years, has encouraged the substitution of capital for labor. This means the labor force gets paid less. This can help explain why the labor participation rate fell from 2000 to 2017, and now is finally starting to turn upward as interest rates rise.
Note that the Fed targets the personal consumption expenditures deflator index, and not the consumer price index, as a possible defense for President Kashkari. Everyone else across the globe uses the CPI as the key price-index measure of inflation.

Fed Should Slowly Unwind Excess Reserves
Before 2008, competition between banks forced them to loan out or otherwise invest excess reserves.

Regarding your editorial “Sharing the Wealth of Markets” (Sept. 21): Yes, recent stock price increases aren’t creating new wealth as broadly as most would like because the market isn’t providing adequate liquidity for the kind of firms that drive economic growth. We believe that much of the blame rests with Federal Reserve policy. 
The New Keynesian model the Fed uses led, in part, to paying banks interest on excess reserves in 2008. Before 2008 excess reserves were virtually zero but now hover near $2 trillion. This is no longer a rational response to the financial panic of 2008-09. Interest payments made by the Fed on those reserves have helped make major banks richer by not issuing loans from reserves but instead earning interest at no risk.
Before 2008, competition between banks forced them to loan out or otherwise invest excess reserves. This produced new economic activity that produced economic gains outside the banking sector. If the Fed began reducing the interest paid on excess reserves, the excess reserves would begin to enter the system and make capital available to startups by increasing liquidity.
If the near $2 trillion of excess reserves entered circulation tomorrow, it would soon expand the money stock, igniting a major inflation. Interest rates paid on excess reserves should therefore be cut in several stages. But if there ever was a compelling argument for paying banks to hold on to excess reserves, that time is past. The sooner the Fed unwinds this practice the sooner we can avoid frustrating the emergence and expansion of a new generation of wealth-creating firms.

We explicitly exploit these features in three computational approaches that are based on integer linear programming, depth-first branch-and-bound, and Boolean satisfiability. Further we introduce two hybrid algorithms that draw upon the diverse strengths of the approaches. Our experimental analysis shows that our optimized algorithms are significantly superior to the baseline algorithms, often with orders of magnitude faster running time.

Analyzing this data, however, is a computational challenge insofar as the computational costs of the relevant algorithms can grow with quadratic, cubic or higher complexity—leading to the need for leadership scale computing. In this paper we describe a new approach to calculations of the Custom Correlation Coefficient (CCC) between Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) across a population, suitable for parallel systems equipped with graphics processing units (GPUs) or Intel Xeon Phi processors. We describe the mapping of the algorithms to accelerated processors, techniques used for eliminating redundant calculations due to symmetries, and strategies for efficient mapping of the calculations to many-node parallel systems. Results are presented demonstrating high per-node performance and near-ideal parallel scalability with rates of more than nine quadrillion (9 × 10^15) element-wise comparisons achieved per second with the latest optimized code on the ORNL Titan system, this being orders of magnitude faster than rates achieved using other codes and platforms as reported in the literature. Also it is estimated that as many as 90 quadrillion (90 × 10^15) comparisons per second may be achievable on the upcoming ORNL Summit system, an additional 10X performance increase.

Sampling 751 subjects from a broad range of latitudes and skin colors, we investigated possible multilocus correlated adaptation of skin color genes with the vitamin D receptor gene (VDR), using a vector correlation metric and network method called BlocBuster. We discovered two multilocus networks involving VDR promoter and skin color genes that display strong latitudinal clines as multilocus networks, even though many of their single gene components do not. Considered one by one, the VDR components of these networks show diverse patterns: no cline, a weak declining latitudinal cline outside of Africa, and a strong in- vs. out-of-Africa frequency pattern. We confirmed these results with independent data from HapMap. Standard linkage disequilibrium analyses did not detect these networks. We applied BlocBuster across the entire genome, showing that our networks are significant outliers for interchromosomal disequilibrium that overlap with environmental variation relevant to the genes' functions. These results suggest that these multilocus correlations most likely arose from a combination of parallel selective responses to a common environmental variable and coadaptation, given the known Mendelian epistasis among VDR and the skin color genes.

Additionally, drought affects plants in both a species-specific and water-deficit-driven manner, causing the response to drought to be dependent both on how drought is being experienced and on any adaptation to prior drought exposure. Thus, understanding the effect of drought on plants requires assessing drought response in multiple conditions, such as progressive acute drought and recurrent cyclic drought, and at different levels of severity. In this study, we have utilized RNA sequencing to identify changes to the plant transcriptome and the phytobiome during both acute progressive drought and cyclic drought at multiple severities. Co-analysis of the plant and phytobiome, utilizing the same RNAseq data, allows for the identification of novel associations that would not be possible otherwise. We have identified that the drought response ranges from increased transcripts related to photosynthesis and metabolic activity in mild acute drought to decreased transcripts related to photosynthesis and metabolic impairment in severe drought. Moreover, while water deficit is a main driver of transcriptional responses in severe drought, there are increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism and photosynthetic transcripts in cyclic severe drought compared with acute severe drought, independent of water deficit. The phytobiome exhibits alternate responses to drought when compared with the transcriptome. Specifically, the phytobiome is affected more by the cyclic or acute nature of the drought rather than the severity of the drought, with the phytobiome having an increase in taxa under cyclic drought that are often reported to have beneficial effects on the plants. Lastly, we have identified associations between taxa in the phytobiome with expression of disease response, ROS metabolism, and photosynthesis transcripts suggesting interplay between the host plant and its phytobiome in response to drought.

Intensive care units dedicated to COVID-19 cases are being confounded by divergent emergency crises, demanding a breadth of specialists and specialized equipment. Although some COVID-19-positive individuals exhibit multiple symptoms, others only show one, and many are completely asymptomatic. Analyses of transcriptomics data hold potential to reveal patterns of gene expression associated with specific outcomes, thereby providing valuable foundational information for breakthrough advances, including diagnostic tools to facilitate precision treatment, seeds for generating hypotheses that decipher underlying biological mechanisms, and potential drug targets, some of which could already have effective medications that can be repurposed. In this issue of Patterns, Ghandikota et al. use differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) to launch into these challenges. We highlight the issues that arise from the use of DEGs. More specifically, pruning based on DEGs removes genes that yield low marginal effects due to epistatic interactions and/or protein multi-tasking.

However, the discovery of modules of genes working in concert to manifest a complex trait has been crippled by combinatorial complexity, genetic heterogeneity, and validation biases. We introduce Maestro, a novel network approach that employs a multifaceted correlation measure, which captures heterogeneity, and a rigorous validation method. Maestro’s utilization for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) reveals an expression pattern that has virtually zero probability of simultaneous expression by an individual, assuming independence. Yet this pattern is exhibited by 19.0% of AD cases and 7.3% of controls, establishing an unprecedented pattern of synchronized genetic activities in the human brain. This pattern is significantly associated with AD, with an odds ratio of 3.0. This study substantiates Maestro’s power for discovery of orchestrated genetic activities underlying complex traits. More generally, Maestro can be applied in diverse domains in which heterogeneity exists.

A popular approach for tackling this challenge is network modeling, as it is a powerful and versatile technique that can be applied in a myriad of domains. However, its full potential is not realized by current implementations due to several subtle, yet menacing, oversights. Herein, we elucidate these flaws and provide common sense solutions. Key issues include overextensions of the transitivity assumption, intolerance of subset heterogeneity, clustering biases, and mishandling of missing data. Solutions range from simple permutations and network scaffolding expansion to close examination and selections of pairwise relationship metrics and clustering algorithms. Application of these strategies reduce false-positive and false-negative signals and open opportunities to tease previously unidentified patterns concealed in the torrent of data produced across the sciences, industry, and government.

The analysis demonstrates that our algorithm consistently finds high quality or even optimal solutions without any a priori knowledge of the network or the desired number of clusters. Furthermore, we compare our results with five previously published methods and yield the highest quality for the largest of the benchmark datasets.

We performed plasma deep proteomic profiling from 332 COVID-19 patients and 150 controls and pursued replication in an independent cohort (297 cases and 76 controls) to find potential biomarkers and causal proteins for three COVID-19 outcomes (infection, ventilation, and death). We identified and replicated 1,449 proteins associated with any of the three outcomes (841 for infection, 833 for ventilation, and 253 for death) that can be query on a web portal ( https://covid.proteomics.wustl.edu/ ). Using those proteins and machine learning approached we created and validated specific prediction models for ventilation (AUC>0.91), death (AUC>0.95) and either outcome (AUC>0.80). These proteins were also enriched in specific biological processes, including immune and cytokine signaling (FDR ≤ 3.72×10  ), Alzheimer's disease (FDR ≤ 5.46×10  ) and coronary artery disease (FDR ≤ 4.64×10  ). Mendelian randomization using pQTL as instrumental variants nominated BCAT2 and GOLM1 as a causal proteins for COVID-19. Causal gene network analyses identified 141 highly connected key proteins, of which 35 have known drug targets with FDA-approved compounds.

Literacy is complex and teaching literacy even more complex. Additionally, because students’ needs change from generation to generation, research on literacy and instruction must evolve, making evidence-based practices that meet the literacy needs of students a moving target. In 2020, the Show Me Literacies Collaborative won a federal grant with the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE). The Show Me Literacies Collaborative began our work by supporting teachers to design literacy action plans for their school. The creation of teacher-generated literacy action plans presents rich opportunities for schools to address and respond to the complexities of literacy instruction. We start this article with an expanded definition of literacy that recognizes the multi-faceted nature of language and literacy. We then describe what literacy action plans are and conclude with our guiding principles for creating teacher-generated literacy action plans.</span>",Nancy R Singer (Role:Author); Diana Hammond (Role:Graduate Student Researcher); Tracy Brosch (Role:Graduate Student Researcher); Julie Sheerman (Role:Author); Katherine O'Daniels (Role:Author); Amy Lannin (Role:Author); Katie Kline (Role:Author); Shea N Kerkhoff (Role:Author); Obudo Laura (Role:Graduate Student Researcher),,,Blind Peer Reviewed,National,Research Board,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Co-author,Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education,,,,English,,Self-reported,

From 2020–2023, the authors facilitated comprehensive literacy professional learning with in-service teachers from 40 schools in the Midwest U.S. Our work aimed to center teachers as experts and be responsive to teachers’ social, emotional, and professional needs. From interrupting neoliberalism and Discourse frameworks, we analyzed interview transcripts and written reflections to understand teachers’ perspectives on professional learning and their praxis. Data revealed that participants perceived an increased need for professional learning on differentiation. Our professional learning attempted to respond to this need through both/and approach them as a path for teachers’ democratic participation. We also found that there was an increased need to focus on growth and joy. Against the backdrop of a neoliberal fixation on teacher accountability that increases stress among teachers, we attempted to attend to teachers’ socioemotional needs. Future research on teacher education for in-service teachers can provide greater insight into teacher perceptions of their professional learning needs post/COVID-19, as well as how we center teachers in order to work against hierarchical power structures and deficit discourses in ways that promote their professional, social, and emotional wellbeing.</p>",Diana Hammond; Leslie Hamm; Jasmin Easterling; Tracy Brosch; Nancy R Singer; Katherine O'Daniels; Shea N.

We present (1) an adaptive modeling strategy to satisfy the performance thresholds of 40 to 100ms for DSPs to decide whether and how much to bid for a potential client to receive a particular advertisement via their mobile device. (2) a dynamic customer profiling technique to map mobile devices to specific lattices (geographic locations), and to track user behavior via device-histories.

However, the effort also has improved putting green construction techniques (PGCT), encouraged the incorporation of naturalized roughs (NR), and improved turfgrass cultivars (ITC). Our objective was to estimate the golf industry's financial benefit from the USGA's investment in these additional three areas. Data were collected from an online survey focused on the benefits associated with golf facilities’ adoption of research-based management practices. Multiple econometric models were developed for PGCT, NR, and ITC that used data from the survey. All three research areas have been widely adopted throughout the U.S. golf industry. Across the three areas studied, modeling indicated a total annual financial benefit of $886.9 million to the golf industry. Further, the total annual financial benefit from all six areas is $1.92 billion.

The effort has developed research-based management practices that have contributed to the efficient use of water, fertilizer, and pesticides on U.S. golf courses. Still, there is insufficient evidence of economic benefits. Therefore, our objective was to estimate the golf industry's resource use and financial benefits from the USGA’s investment in water, fertilizer, and pesticide management research. Data were collected from an online survey focused on the benefits associated with golf-facility adoption of research-based management practices in six primary areas of interest: 1) ET-based irrigation scheduling (water budgeting), 2) soil-moisture sensing, 3) BMPs that reduce nonpoint source pollution of fertilizers and pesticides, 4) putting green construction techniques, 5) naturalized rough, and 6) improved turfgrass cultivars. Only areas 1-3 are discussed in this paper. Utilizing data from the survey, multiple econometric models were developed for each of the management practices. All three research-based management practices have been widely adopted throughout the U.S. golf industry. Across the three management practices studied, modeling indicates that the total annual financial benefits were estimated to be approximately $900 million.

Highly complex Machine Learning (ML) models have flourished in many tasks of intelligence, and the questions have started to shift away from traditional metrics of validity towards something deeper: What is this model telling me about my data, and how is it arriving at these conclusions? Previous work has uncovered predictive models generating explanations contrasting domain experts, or excessively exploiting bias in data that renders a model useless in highly-regulated settings. These inconsistencies between XAI and modeling techniques can have the undesirable effect of casting doubt upon the efficacy of these explainability approaches. To address these problems, we propose a systematic, perturbation-based analysis against a popular, model-agnostic method in XAI, SHapley Additive exPlanations (Shap). We devise algorithms to generate relative feature importance in settings of dynamic inference amongst a suite of popular machine learning and deep learning methods, and metrics that allow us to quantify how well explanations generated under the static case hold. We propose a taxonomy for feature importance methodology, measure alignment, and observe quantifiable similarity amongst explanation models across several datasets.</span>",Dan Dolk (Role:Author); Donald J Kridel (Role:Author); Jacob Dineen (Role:Author); Dave Castillo (Role:Author),,,Blind Peer Reviewed,International,,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Co-author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Clinton,Greene,Smooth-Adjustment Econometrics And Inventory-Theoretic Money Management,The Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control,2/6/2010,2010.0,,,,,Accepted,,,,,Spring,2010,"   This paper corrects theoretical errors in the monetary literature and shows these theoretical errors are empirically important.  It also shows that careful consideration of theoretical issues can result in a model which improves the ability to forecast, a standard usually evaded in the literature.  I show that the use of a generic non-linear model of aggregate money called ""smooth-adjustment"" is not supported by theory, as mistakenly claimed in a growing number of published papers.  I present the correct theory-based non-linear model.  And I show this correct non-linear model forecasts actual money held in the USA more accurately than standard models.  I also discuss obstacles to implementing the correct model and suggest various approaches for using data from other economies.    More than five years ago this paper consisted of both theoretical and empirical sections.  At this time there were only a couple studies applying ""smooth-adjustment"", incorrectly claiming theoretical support for this statistical method.  After some journal rejections I decided there were too many targets for referees.  So I shortened the paper to include only the theoretical commentary.  By the time the paper was accepted, the number of published papers making the theoretical error had tripled.  These papers examined data from multiple countries and time periods.  And the number of citations of this erroneous literature was growing.     After the paper was submitted, revised and then accepted at the Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, the editor asked me to add an empirical application.  But this request by the editor was optional, the paper was acceptable at that point.  I replied I could do so in about 6 pages, but ended up with an additional 14, not counting 6 additional tables.

Clinton,Greene,Recent Controversies in Forecast-Based Model Validation,Journal of Economics,,2014.0,,18,,,Submitted,,,,,Fall,2014,"In 1972 a notable group including Phoebus Dhrymes, Jan Kmenta, Edward Leamer, and Richard Quandt jointly advocated the use of reserved-sample prediction to validate econometric models.  But recently we have more commonly seen use of nested-model forecast competitions.  I argue that as usually implemented this newer approach is not a substitute for reserved-sample forecasts.  Apparent failures such as those surveyed by Rossi (2013, for exchange rate models) or surveyed by Stock and Watson (2009, for Phillips curve models) should never lead one to reject a theory.  But if this common nested-model practice is modified to employ the realized values or actual fundamentals employed by the older reserved-sample approach, then this hybrid approach has important strengths.  It provides a more powerful test of the underlying theory than either reserved-sample or the unmodified nested-model approach.  And rather than asking whether the economic model should be rejected as unstable (yes or no), it imposes an opportunity-cost framework, asking whether the economic model improves upon the next best alternative.

For vector-transmitted parasites, in particular, distributions might be influenced by host-switching and by parasite dispersal with primary hosts and vectors. We surveyed haemosporidian blood parasites (Plasmodium and Haemoproteus) of small land birds in eastern North America to characterize a regional parasite community. Distributions of parasite populations generally reflected distributions of their hosts across the region. However, when the interdependence between hosts and parasites was controlled statistically, local host assemblages were related to regional climatic gradients, but parasite assemblages were not. Moreover, because parasite assemblage similarity does not decrease with distance when controlling for host assemblages and climate, parasites evidently disperse readily within the distributions of their hosts. The degree of specialization on hosts varied in some parasite lineages over short periods and small geographic distances independently of the diversity of available hosts and potentially competing parasite lineages. Nonrandom spatial turnover was apparent in parasite lineages infecting one host species that was well-sampled within a single year across its range, plausibly reflecting localized adaptations of hosts and parasites. Overall, populations of avian hosts generally determine the geographic distributions of haemosporidian parasites. However, parasites are not dispersal-limited within their host distributions, and they may switch hosts readily.

Lipid peroxidation was quantified in each tissue by spectrophotometric measurement of malondialdehyde using the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances assay.In all tissues, lipid peroxidation increased greatly as development proceeded. Concentrations of malondialdehyde increased in parallel with the cumulative amount of oxygen consumed by the developing embryo consistent with the hypothesis that oxidative stress results from the production of free radicals due to oxidative metabolism.This study describes in vivo oxidative stress in developing avian embryos and suggests that rates of embryonic growth, oxidative metabolism and oxidative damage likely vary in parallel.",T.

In addition, it is important to identify populations of pathogens that are evolutionarily independent and thus 'free' to adapt to hosts and environments. Here, we investigated genetic variation in the globally distributed, highly invasive avian malaria parasite Plasmodium relictum, which has several distinctive mitochondrial haplotyps (cyt b lineages, SGS1, GRW11 and GRW4). The phylogeography of P. relictum was accessed using the highly variable nuclear gene merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1), a gene linked to the invasion biology of the parasite. We show that the lineage GRW4 is evolutionarily independent of GRW11 and SGS1 whereas GRW11 and SGS1 share MSP1 alleles and thus suggesting the presence of two distinct species (GRW4 versus SGS1 and GRW11). Further, there were significant differences in the global distribution of MSP1 alleles with differences between GRW4 alleles in the New and the Old World. For SGS1, a lineage formerly believed to have both tropical and temperate transmission, there were clear differences in MSP1 alleles transmitted in tropical Africa compared to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia. Further, we highlight the occurrence of multiple MSP1 alleles in GRW4 isolates from the Hawaiian Islands, where the parasite has contributed to declines and extinctions of endemic forest birds since it was introduced.

Birds and their malaria parasites provide a useful model for understanding host-parasite relationships, but this model lacks a well-described experimental context for how hosts respond immunologically to infection. Here, ten canaries (Serinus canaria) were infected with the avian malaria parasite Plasmodium relictum (lineage SGS1) in a controlled laboratory setting with ten uninfected (control) birds. A suite of immunological blood parameters, including the concentration of four white blood cell types, the concentration of the acute phase protein haptoglobin, and the bacteria-killing ability of blood plasma, were repeatedly measured over a 25-day period covering the acute phase of a primary infection by P. relictum. Three infected and one control bird died during the course of the experiment. A multivariate statistical analysis of the immune indices revealed significant differences between infected and uninfected individuals between 5 and 14 days postinfection (dpi). Group differences corresponded to reduced concentrations of lymphocytes (5 dpi), heterophils (8 dpi), and monocytes (11 and 14 dpi), and an increase in haptoglobin (14 dpi), in infected birds relative to uninfected controls, and no change in bacteria-killing. Upon re-running the analysis with only the surviving birds, immunological differences between infected and control birds shifted to between 11 and 18 dpi. However, there were no clear correlates relating immune parameters to the likelihood of surviving the infection. The results presented here demonstrate the dynamic and complex nature of avian immune function during the acute phase of malaria infection and provide a context for studies investigating immune function in wild birds.

Robert,Ricklefs,The ecology of host immune responses to chronic avian haemosporidian infection,Oecologia,1/1/2014,2014.0,Article in press,,,,Completed/Published,,,,,Spring,2016,"Host responses to parasitism in the wild are often studied in the context of single host-parasite systems, which provide little insight into the ecological dynamics of host-parasite interactions within a community. Here we characterized immune system responses to mostly low-intensity, chronic infection by haemosporidian parasites in a sample of 424 individuals of 22 avian host species from the same local assemblage in the Missouri Ozarks. Two types of white blood cells (heterophils and lymphocytes) were elevated in infected individuals across species, as was the acute-phase protein haptoglobin, which is associated with inflammatory immune responses. Linear discriminant analysis indicated that individuals infected by haemosporidians occupied a subset of the overall white blood cell multivariate space that was also occupied by uninfected individuals, suggesting that these latter individuals might have harbored other pathogens or that parasites more readily infect individuals with a specific white blood cell profile. DNA sequence-defined lineages of haemosporidian parasites were sparsely distributed across the assemblage of hosts. In one well-sampled host species, the red-eyed vireo (Vireo olivaceus), heterophils were significantly elevated in individuals infected with one but not another of two common parasite lineages. Another well-sampled host, the yellow-breasted chat (Icteria virens), exhibited no differences in immune response to different haemosporidian lineages. Our results indicate that while immune responses to infection may be generalized across host species, parasite-specific immune responses may also occur. ",V. A. Ellis; R. E. Ricklefs; M. R.

Patricia,Parker,Lineage sorting in multihost parasites: Eidmanniella albescens and Fregatiella aurifasciata on seabirds from the Galapagos Islands,Ecology and Evolution,8/1/2015,2015.0,5,3264 - 3271,16,,Completed/Published,10.1002/ece3.1587,26380662,,2045-7758,Fall,2015,"Parasites comprise a significant percentage of the biodiversity of the planet and are useful systems to test evolutionary and ecological hypotheses. In this study, we analyze the effect of host species identity and the immediate local species assemblage within mixed species colonies of nesting seabirds on patterns of genetic clustering within two species of multihost ectoparasitic lice. We use three genetic markers (one mitochondrial, COI, and two nuclear, EF1- and wingless) and maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees to test whether (1) parasites show lineage sorting based on their host species; and (2) switching of lineages to the alternate host species depends on the immediate local species assemblage of individual hosts within a colony. Specifically, we examine the genetic structure of two louse species: Eidmanniella albescens, infecting both Nazca (Sula granti) and blue-footed boobies (Sula nebouxii), and Fregatiella aurifasciata, infecting both great (Fregata minor) and magnificent frigatebirds (Fregata magnificens). We found that host species identity was the only factor explaining the patterns of genetic structure in both parasites. In both cases, there is evident genetic differentiation depending on the host species. Thus, a revision of the taxonomy of these louse species is needed. One possible explanation of this pattern is extremely low louse migration rates between host species, perhaps influenced by fine-scale spatial separation of host species within mixed colonies, and low parasite infrapopulation numbers.

Participants reported stronger PSR and identification with the more familiar characters from the first trilogy than with the new characters introduced in the film, although the association with identification was limited to older participants. Star Wars fanship was associated with identification and PSR for old and new characters. Familiarity with the earlier films was associated with PSR of old and new characters and with identification with the old characters. Participants were more likely to cite characters of the same gender as the one to which they felt most connected, but among the “most connected” newer characters a viewer–character gender match was not associated with stronger identification or PSR. Identification, but not PSR, with the story antagonist was associated with greater hedonic enjoyment and appreciation. Implications for audience responses to other transmedia narratives and for processes of audience reception in general are discussed.

Alice,Hall,Transportation into Audio-visual Narratives: A Closer Look,Communication Quarterly,,2021.0,69,564-585.,,,Completed/Published,,,,,Fall,2021,"This manuscript describes two studies that examine a scale that is commonly used to measure the concept of narrative transportation (audience involvement in a narrative). The scale was originally designed for written narratives, and many studies now use this scale for audio-visual (AV) stimuli, under the assumption that the scale performs the same across the different mediums. We explore if the scale does in fact perform the same in relation to written versus audio-visual narratives. In Study 1, 125 participants are exposed to one of two versions (print or video) of the same narrative. A confirmatory factor analysis indicates that the scale is not unidimensional and the factor structure is not consistent between print and video formats. Follow-up questions show that those participants who viewed the film version were puzzled by items in the scale that asked about their ability to imagine what they had seen. A new 6-item short form of the scale was also tested. Measurement invariance across the print and video groups was not supported.

Alice,Hall,Audience Responses to Diverse Superheroes: The Roles of Gender and Race in Forging Connections with Media Characters in Superhero Franchise Films,"Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts",,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1037/aca0000363,In Press,,,,,Fall,2021,"The manuscript is about 10,000 words. 

The study took advantage of the recent release of several mainstream, franchise action films featuring diverse casts to investigate how the gender and race of viewers interacts with those of the characters to shape viewers’ sense of connection to the characters. Through an online survey of 147 viewers, it addresses which characters within a film the viewers saw themselves as most connected to, and considers two types of subjective, virtual connections to specific characters - identification and parasocial relationship (PSR). Respondents were more likely to cite characters played by actors of the same gender or the same race as the one to which they felt most connected. Participants reported stronger parasocial relationships with characters played by actors who were women.  A viewer-actor match in terms of race was associated with stronger PSR, which was attributable to African American respondents’ engagement with characters from Black Panther. Demographic correspondences between the viewers and the actors playing their selected characters were not associated with stronger identification. The results are interpreted in light of respondents’ open-ended ended questions about their character selection. The generalizability and implications of the findings are discussed.

Cumulative grade Point Average was found to be a consistent determinant in student success and students were found to have significantly better learning outcomes, as expressed through course grades, in the face-to-face delivery mode for the introductory class. Student grades were then evaluated in the next, more advanced Information Systems course, using a second ordered probit regression model.  The results indicated that mode of delivery, online or face-to-face, for the more advanced course had no significant impact on student grades for that course, but students who had enrolled in the online and hybrid delivery modes in the first course of the sequence performed significantly better, as measured by course grade, in the more advanced course regardless of delivery mode.

I focus on findings from a survey about approaches, activities, and assignments in their courses, as well as how their experiences in graduate school may shape their own teaching. Themes emerged that questioned common pedagogies in English graduate courses: discussion and essays. Moreover, a troubling theme of graduate students insisting they need to adapt and adjust, what I call the reverse accommodation, underlies much of this survey data. These themes open up a space to wonder about norms that shape graduate school in English. I argue that we must attend to this wonder, listening to, trusting, and learning from graduate students’ experiences, especially when these experiences express misfit with what is assumed or expected in graduate education. Through attentive wonder and listening, and orienting access as an ongoing process, disability can be centered rather than bypassed, approached as generative rather than a problem to solve.

Several polyamide molecules have been found to have potent antiviral activities against papillomavirus, a double-stranded DNA virus. By analogy, we reason that polyamides may also interact with the structured RNA bound in the nucleocapsid of a negative strand RNA virus. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was selected as a prototype virus to test this possibility since its genomic RNA encaspsidated in the nucleocapsid forms a structure resembling one strand of an A-form RNA duplex. One polyamide molecule, UMSL1011, was found to inhibit infection of VSV with an EC50 value of <10 μg/mL. To confirm that the polyamide targeted the nucleocapsid, a nucleocapsid-like particle (NLP) was
 incubated with UMSL1011. The encapsidated RNA in the polyamide treated NLP was protected from thermo-release and digestion by RNase A. The cytotoxic concentration (CC50) of this polyamide was higher than 650 μM. UMSL1011 also inhibits viral RNA synthesis in the intracellular activity assay for the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The crystal structure revealed that UMSL1011 binds the structured RNA in the nucleocapsid. The conclusion of our studies is that the RNA in the nucleocapsid is a viable antiviral target of polyamides. Since the RNA structure in the nucleocapsid is similar in all negative strand RNA viruses, polyamides may be optimized to target the specific RNA genome of a negative strand RNA virus, such as respiratory syncytial virus and Ebola virus.",James K Bashkin (Role:Author); Ryan H Gumper (Role:Graduate Student Researcher); Weike Li (Role:Graduate Student Researcher); Carlos H Castaneda (Role:Graduate Student Researcher); Maria J Scuderi (Role:Graduate Student Researcher); Ming Luo (Role:Author),,,Blind Peer Reviewed,International,College,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Co-author,Research Board,"This collaboration grew from my seminar at Georgia State.

G., Koeller, K. J., Slomczynska, U., Fok, K., Helmus, M., Bashkin, J. K., Fisher, C., Antiviral Res. 91 (2011) 177-186). Described here are the interactions of these PAs with sequences in the long control region (LCR) of HPV16 (7348-122). Using an FeEDTA conjugate of PA1 (designed to recognize 5'-W2GW7-3'; W = A or T), 34 affinity cleavage (AC) patterns were detected for this fragment. These sites can be rationalized with sequences featuring perfect, single, double, triple and quadruple mismatches. Quantitative DNase I footprinting analysis indicates that perfect sites bind PA1 with Kds between 0.7 and 2.2 nM. Kds for single, double, triple and quadruple mismatch sites range from 1-3 nM-20 nM. Using AC and EDTA conjugates, we report that unlike smaller 8-ring hairpin PAs, introduction of a chiral turn in this large polyamide has no effect on binding orientation (forward vs. reverse). Despite its design to recognize 5'-W2GW5GW4-3' via two Im residues, a motif not represented in this HPV sequence, a PA25-EDTA conjugate yielded 31 affinity cleavage sites on the region. Low nM Kds for PA25 without EDTA indicates a high tolerance for triple and quadruple mismatches. While there is extensive coverage of the sequence examined, AC cleavage patterns for the two PAs show discrete binding events and do not overlap significantly. This indicates that within the context of A/T rich sequences, these PAs do not recognize a simple shared sequence-related feature of the DNA. These insights continue to inform the complex nature of large hairpin PA-DNA interactions and antiviral behavior.",James K Bashkin; Cynthia M Dupureur; Elena Vasilieva; Jacquelyn Niederschulte; Yang Song; Puhong Liao; George D Harris; Kevin J Koeller,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,International,Research Board,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Co-author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,
James,Bashkin,What is the antiviral potential of pyrrole-imidazole polyamides?,Future Med. Chem.,10/23/2016,2015.0,7,1953-1955,15,,Completed/Published,10.4155/fmc.15.120,26496156,,1756-8919,Fall,2015,"A novel antiviral mechanism for polyamides is described after discussing prior work. N-Methylpyrrole (Py)- and N-methylimidazole (Im)-derived polyamides are higher homologs of natural product distamycin A, which binds sequence-selectively to AT-rich double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). Instead of interacting with DNA via Watson–Crick or Hoogsteen base pairing, polyamides recognize dsDNA by reading the ‘edges’ of intact Watson–Crick pairs in the minor groove of the double helix [1]. At sufficient concentrations, distamycin binds to dsDNA in a 2:1 ratio, antiparallel, and this arrangement has been mimicked with great success by longer, nominally linear polyamides that incorporate a flexible building block and bend near the middle, resembling hairpins. The hairpin motif is favored because it forms a double-stranded polyamide and allows the 2:1 style of binding to take place with a 1:1 molar ratio of (folded) polyamide to DNA. Aromatic rings stack in both the polyamide region and the DNA, which adds to hydrogen bonding, giving high affinity and a sequence specificity that can seem very high. A cationic guanidine or amidine group is found at the N- and/or C-termini of distamycin A and its natural analogs; this charge presumably improves both solubility and affinity to anionic DNA. These charged moieties are often replaced in synthetic polyamides by mono- and di-amines, or more complex structures [2].

In order to exploit polyamide (PA)-DNA binding, synthetic polyamides have been shown to recognize DNA with reportedly universal recognition rules [3]. In this recognition, two antiparallel strands of a hairpin polyamide lie side-by-side in the minor groove, and polyamide amino acid pairs from each strand recognize Watson–Crick base pairs through hydrogen bonding and shape complementarity. Generally, stacked Py/Py rings recognize A/T or T/A base pairs. By introducing the Im moiety, polyamides acquire the ability to recognize G/C base pairs: Im/Py pairs recognize G/C base pairs while stacked Py/Im rings recognize C/G base pairs [4]: hydrogen bonding occurs to the Im nitrogen from the exocyclic NH2 of guanine. Introduction of flexible β-alanine linkers in place of heterocycles adjusts for long-range imperfections in the alignment of polyamide-DNA H-bonds and allows targeting of long DNA sequences by long polyamides [5].

Synthetic Py/Im PAs have shown promising properties such as frequently, though not always, penetrating cell membranes and localizing to the nucleus [6], which makes them an attractive tool for many biomedical applications. Because hairpin PAs distinguish DNA sequences by interacting with sequence-dependent patterns of H-bond donors and acceptors in the minor groove of DNA [7], synthesized polyamides have shown the ability to inhibit gene transcription by simply blocking transcription initiation when programmed to target regulatory regions of DNA [8,9]. Polyamides have also been used to activate gene transcription when fused to a transcriptional activator, and several hairpin PA-activation domain conjugates have shown the ability to reactivate gene transcription in vitro [10]. Polyamides can also be coupled to mutagenic agents to induce site-directed mutagenesis and to alkylating agents to silence genes [11–13]. The unique properties of polyamides make them promising candidates for antiviral treatment. However, due to the selective rather than specific recognition of polyamides for double-stranded DNA, they are most likely suitable for viruses containing double-stranded DNA in their life cycle, including dsDNA viruses and retroviruses.

One approach was to design polyamides that recognize viral genomic sequences and block essential viral DNA–protein interactions. In human papillomaviruses (HPV), the transcription and replication regulatory factor E2 forms a homodimer and binds to a 12 bp recognition site. Parekh and colleagues designed a tandem hairpin polyamide which targeted the E2-binding sites [9]. Such tandem hairpin polyamides bound cognate E2 sites in the minor groove and altered the local DNA geometry. Shape changes prevented the major groove-binding E2 homodimer from binding the DNA-PA complex even though the two ligands occupy opposite faces of the double helix; minor groove-binding polyamides could even displace major groove-binding E2 from DNA in cell-free assays. A similar experiment also successfully employed a hairpin PA to recognize the EBNA1-binding sequence in the Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) genome, inhibit EBNA1 binding and repress EBV-induced B-cell immortalization [14].

A second antiviral approach is to fuse a DNA alkylating reagent to a polyamide, which combines the DNA damage from the alkylator with the sequence selectivity of the polyamide. The alkylating agent is brought into close proximity of the target DNA by the polyamide, presumably improving alkylation efficiency of target sites and decreasing unwanted alkylation of the host genome. Beerman and colleagues synthesized PAs conjugated to alkylators chlorambucil [13] and cyclopropylpyrroloindole [11]; both showed the ability to damage and crosslink SV40 DNA at the designated target site.

A third approach is to target the essential host DNA-binding transcription factors which are required for viral replication. Dervan's group synthesized a group of hairpin polyamides which are designed to target Ets-1, LEF-1 and TBP individually. All three proteins belong to the HIV-1 enhancer/promoter element [8]. The combination of three polyamides apparently shutdown the promoter and inhibited 99% of HIV-1 replication in isolated human peripheral blood lymphocytes.

Our group has reported a fourth approach to fighting viral diseases, at least for certain small, dsDNA tumor viruses. We and colleagues at NanoVir reported a new class of relatively long, hairpin polyamides which exhibits potent antiviral activity against three high-risk HPVs (HPV-16, -18 and -31) [15]. In this context, ‘long’ means binding approximately one full turn or more of DNA. Active compounds were found in a PA library designed to recognize AT-rich DNA sequences in or near E1 or E2 binding sites of the HPV16 origin of replication. Active polyamides caused the dose-dependent loss of viral DNA without cytotoxicity and with selectivity indices of >2000, and also caused the loss of HPV DNA in epithelial tissue engineered in vitro [15]. This is the only polyamide class that destroys viral episomes. Two compounds are in preclinical development for treatment/prevention of HPV-related disease. In the previously mentioned approaches, polyamides are used either to interfere with DNA–protein interactions or improve DNA alkylation; the mechanism of action in our new approach is more complicated. When cells containing HPV episomes are treated with active polyamides, viral episomes are altered conformationally within 5 h. Shape changes presumably lead to the observed activation of DNA damage response pathways – that is, phosphorylation of Rad9 – and massive elimination of episomal DNA follows [16]. Long hairpin polyamides elicit a novel antiviral mechanism and do not obey literature DNA recognition rules [15,17].

Polyamides have great potential as drug candidates to treat a variety of viral diseases. Various modifications at C termini [18] and γ-turns [19] have been introduced to improve cellular uptake and nuclear localization of PAs. We have incorporated the majority of these modifications with no improvement in anti-HPV activity, though our own medicinal chemistry has brought pseudo-IC50 values below 10 nM (cell culture concentration). Understanding uptake mechanisms and the complete mechanism of action are future goals. In addition, PA-DNA binding rules were mostly determined with small, carefully designed DNA sequences, while next generation sequencing has shown that such rules don't dominate in a large-scale, genomic context [20]. Our new molecules display sequence selectivity according to recursive formulas, but show little regard for DNA recognition rules, and this is at the heart of their broad-spectrum activity: HPV-16, -18, and -31 have homologous genomes from a bioinformatics perspective, but are not homologous according to published rules.

The structural distortion of DNA caused by polyamides has enhanced our understanding of the regulation of DNA-binding proteins via polyamides. Polyamides have DNA binding affinities that are comparable to those proteins and can therefore potentially be used as therapeutic agents to treat diseases caused by aberrant gene expression. In fact, many diseases are characterized by over- or under-expressed genes. PU.1 is a transcription factor that regulates many immune system genes. Aberrant expression of PU.1 was associated with the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We have, therefore, designed and synthesized ten hairpin polyamides to investigate their capacity in controlling the PU.1-DNA interaction. Our results showed that nine of the polyamides disrupt PU.1-DNA binding and the inhibition capacity strongly correlates with binding affinity. One molecule, FH1024, was observed forming a FH1024-PU.1-DNA trimer instead of inhibiting PU.1-DNA binding. This is the first report of a small molecule that is potentially a weak agonist that recruits PU.1 to DNA. This finding sheds light on the design of polyamides that exhibit novel regulatory mechanisms on protein-DNA binding.",W.

James,Bashkin,A Polyamide Inhibits Replication of Vesicular Stomatitis Virus by Targeting RNA in the Nucleocapsid,Journal of virology,3/28/2018,2018.0,92,,8,,Completed/Published,10.1128/JVI.00146-18,29437970,PMC5874401,1098-5514,Spring,2018,"Polyamides have been shown to bind double-stranded DNA by complementing the curvature of the minor groove and forming various hydrogen bonds with DNA. Several polyamide molecules have been found to have potent antiviral activities against papillomavirus, a double-stranded DNA virus. By analogy, we reason that polyamides may also interact with the structured RNA bound in the nucleocapsid of a negative-strand RNA virus. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was selected as a prototype virus to test this possibility since its genomic RNA encapsidated in the nucleocapsid forms a structure resembling one strand of an A-form RNA duplex. One polyamide molecule, UMSL1011, was found to inhibit infection of VSV. To confirm that the polyamide targeted the nucleocapsid, a nucleocapsid-like particle (NLP) was incubated with UMSL1011. The encapsidated RNA in the polyamide-treated NLP was protected from thermo-release and digestion by RNase A. UMSL1011 also inhibits viral RNA synthesis in the intracellular activity assay for the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The crystal structure revealed that UMSL1011 binds the structured RNA in the nucleocapsid. The conclusion of our studies is that the RNA in the nucleocapsid is a viable antiviral target of polyamides. Since the RNA structure in the nucleocapsid is similar in all negative-strand RNA viruses, polyamides may be optimized to target the specific RNA genome of a negative-strand RNA virus, such as respiratory syncytial virus and Ebola virus. Negative-strand RNA viruses (NSVs) include several life-threatening pathogens, such as rabies virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and Ebola virus. There are no effective antiviral drugs against these viruses. Polyamides offer an exceptional opportunity because they may be optimized to target each NSV. Our studies on vesicular stomatitis virus, an NSV, demonstrated that a polyamide molecule could specifically target the viral RNA in the nucleocapsid and inhibit viral growth. The target specificity of the polyamide molecule was proved by its inhibition of thermo-release and RNA nuclease digestion of the RNA bound in a model nucleocapsid, and a crystal structure of the polyamide inside the nucleocapsid. This encouraging observation provided the proof-of-concept rationale for designing polyamides as antiviral drugs against NSVs.",James K Bashkin; Ming Luo; Weike Li; Carlos H Castañeda; M J Scuderi; Ryan H Gumpper,No,,Blind Peer Reviewed,International,College,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Co-author,Research Board,I co-conceived the project with collaborator Ming Luo of Georgia State,,,English,,Self-reported,

Synthetic modifications can improve PA-DNA binding affinity and include flexible modules, such as β-alanine (β) motifs to replace pyrroles (Py), and increasing compound charge using N-terminal cationic substituents. To better understand the variations in kinetics and affinities caused by these modifications on PA-DNA interactions, a comprehensive set of PAs with different numbers and positions of β and different types of N-cationic groups was systematically designed and synthesized to bind their cognate sequence, the λB motif. The λB motif is also a strong binding promoter site of the major groove targeting transcription factor PU.1. The PA binding affinities and kinetics were evaluated using a spectrum of powerful biophysical methods: thermal melting, biosensor surface plasmon resonance and circular dichroism. The results show that β inserts affect PA-DNA interactions in a number and position dependent manner. Specifically, a β replacement between two imidazole heterocycles (ImβIm) generally strengthens binding. In addition, N-terminal cationic groups can accelerate the association between PA and DNA, but the bulky size of TMG can cause steric hindrance and unfavourable repulsive electrostatic interactions in some PAs.

As is common among the smaller 6-8-ring hairpin polyamides (PAs), it binds its target recognition sequence with low nM affinity. However, in addition to its large size, it is distinct from these more extensively characterized PAs in its high tolerance for mismatches and antiviral properties. In ongoing attempts to understand the basis for these distinctions, we conducted thermodynamics studies of PA1-DNA interactions. The temperature dependence of binding affinity was measured using TAMRA-labeled hairpin DNAs containing a single target sequence. PA1 binding to either an ATAT/TATA or an AAAA/TTTT pattern is consistently entropically driven. This is in contrast to the A/T pattern-dependent driving forces for DNA binding by netropsin,
distamycin, and smaller hairpin polyamides. Analysis of the salt dependence of PA1-DNA binding reveals that within experimental error, there is no dependence on ionic strength, indicating that the polyelectrolyte effect does not contribute to PA1-DNA binding energetics. This is similar to that observed for smaller PAs. PA1-DNA recognition sequence binding stoichiometries were determined at both nM (fluorescence) and mM (circular dichroism) concentrations.

James,Bashkin,Size Matters: DNA Binding Site Kinetics as a Function of Polyamide Size,Biochimie,,2022.0,,,,,Completed/Published,,,,,Summer,2022,"Hairpin polyamides (PAs) are remarkable minor groove-binding DNA ligands that demonstrate high affinity and sequence selectivity.  Following extensive studies of 6-8 ring hairpin PAs, including many thermodynamic and kinetics measurements, have been more recent descriptions of larger PAs (14 rings or more) and their distinctive properties and biological activities.  However, there are essentially no comparative studies of PA DNA binding behaviors over a range of PA sizes, making it difficult to understand critical structure-activity relationships related to PA size.  Described herein is the first comparative study as a function of hairpin PA size that examines the complexities of PA-DNA binding behaviors with unprecedented detail.  DNA binding kinetics of PAs with 6 (PA6) and 20 (PA20) rings are extensively characterized by fluorescence spectroscopy, and the properties compared with those of 8 and 14 ring hairpin PAs.  PA6 has a 1:1 binding site stoichiometry but exhibits biphasic association kinetics, consistent with populating more than one binding mode.  One decay constant is at the diffusion-controlled limit, and the other is 400-fold slower.  In contrast, PA20 has high binding site stoichiometry (2.5:1) but displays a much simpler association kinetic trace with a decay constant of 1e6 M-1s-1.  Due to the variability and complexity of association kinetics, it is difficult to identify trends in this behavior as a function of PA size.  However, even though hairpin PAs of 8 or more rings bind DNA with similar affinities, residence times increase as PA size increases, ranging from 20 sec to over 2500 sec.  Particularly compelling is that the antiviral PA20 shows little to no dissociation from DNA when challenged with competitor DNA, suggesting that high residence times are important for this biological activity.

More recent studies of large antiviral PAs (14-20 rings) active against small DNA tumor viruses lead to questions regarding the extent to which the DNA binding behaviors of the well studied, smaller PAs can be reliably extrapolated to the larger ones. Described here is the first reported study of hairpin PA-DNA binding thermodynamics as a function of PA size (6-20 rings). All PAs exhibit binding affinity in the low nM to upper pM range, which indicates that affinity is not a discriminator of antiviral activity. Unlike the smaller PAs, a 20-ring PA does not appreciably dissociate from DNA in competition experiments, which indicates very long residence time that is consistent with antiviral activity. While the DNA binding thermodynamics for the smaller antivirally inactive 6- and 8-ring PAs is clearly enthalpically driven, the larger antiviral PAs (14- and 20-rings) exhibit strongly entropically-driven DNA binding. These distinct energetic signatures indicate that different types of interactions drive these associations. In DNA binding site stoichiometry experiments conducted at both nM and μM concentrations, all PAs except the 6-ring PA bind an isolated site with site stoichiometry of at least two PAs per recognition sequence. Electrostatic contributions to DNA binding affinity are small for all PAs and not correlated with PA size but weakly correlated with the number of imidazole residues. Altogether, these results indicate that DNA binding behaviors of smaller hairpin PAs do not necessarily reflect those of larger PAs. These are vital considerations in the development of hairpin PAs for biological use.",Kristi N Bales (Role:Undergraduate Student Researcher); Yang Song (Role:Graduate Student Researcher); James K Bashkin (Role:Author); Andrew H Park (Role:Undergraduate Student Researcher); Jacquelyn Niederschulte (Role:Graduate Student Researcher); Cynthia M Dupureur (Role:Author),,,Blind Peer Reviewed,International,Research Board,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Co-author,ACS PRF,"This work was based on a project that I conceived and supervised, and used molecules designed and prepared in my group, but Professor Dupureur was the intellectual driving force behind this part of the work.",,,English,,Self-reported,

While the characterization of PA-DNA behavior has focused principally on hairpin PAs 6-8 rings in size, there is increasing evidence that their behavior does not necessarily reflect the complexities that are emerging from studies of larger hairpin PAs, particularly concerning sequence mismatch tolerance and observed but unaddressed high PA-target site binding stoichiometries. To explore these complexities in more detail, kinetics studies of binding a large anti-HPV hairpin polyamide to an isolated DNA recognition site are described. Using a fluorescence assay, two distinct binding phases are observed for the first time in hairpin PA literature. PA14 concentration dependence analysis indicates that the faster binding event is diffusion-controlled; the apparent, second event is significantly slower (350-1500 fold). Both association phases are sampled in 1:1 complexes, consistent with cooperative binding of two PA molecules even under this condition. Fitting of the slow phase to a biexponential model yields two λ that differ by 4-5-fold, which is consistent with the high mismatch tolerance and binding site stoichiometry previously observed.

G., Koeller, K. J., Slomczynska, U., Fok, K., Helmus, M., Bashkin, J. K., Fisher, C., Antiviral Res. 91 (2011) 177-186). Described here are the interactions of these PAs with sequences in the long control region (LCR) of HPV16 (7348-122). Using an FeEDTA conjugate of PA1 (designed to recognize 5'-W2GW7-3'; W = A or T), 34 affinity cleavage (AC) patterns were detected for this fragment. These sites can be rationalized with sequences featuring perfect, single, double, triple and quadruple mismatches. Quantitative DNase I footprinting analysis indicates that perfect sites bind PA1 with Kds between 0.7 and 2.2 nM. Kds for single, double, triple and quadruple mismatch sites range from 1-3 nM-20 nM. Using AC and EDTA conjugates, we report that unlike smaller 8-ring hairpin PAs, introduction of a chiral turn in this large polyamide has no effect on binding orientation (forward vs. reverse). Despite its design to recognize 5'-W2GW5GW4-3' via two Im residues, a motif not represented in this HPV sequence, a PA25-EDTA conjugate yielded 31 affinity cleavage sites on the region. Low nM Kds for PA25 without EDTA indicates a high tolerance for triple and quadruple mismatches. While there is extensive coverage of the sequence examined, AC cleavage patterns for the two PAs show discrete binding events and do not overlap significantly. This indicates that within the context of A/T rich sequences, these PAs do not recognize a simple shared sequence-related feature of the DNA.

We investigate whether there are disparities in campaign contributions based on the race and gender of the candidates, as well as the race of donors. To test this, we examine campaign contributions in St. Louis City mayoral elections from 2011-2021, which include candidates who are Black, white, women, and men. We find significant differences in the campaign contributions women and Black candidates receive; results also show significant differences in the amount of money donors contribute by race. Our findings suggest that fundraising strategies for mayoral candidates are likely to vary substantially by candidate race and sex.

Most of the research on source cues in the United States tests the impact of national leaders or parties as cues. We argue that hypotheses about source cues should be tested in other settings, such as local politics. Local settings offer a test where source cues may not be so closely tied to partisan identity. We hypothesize that in contexts where the source is well-known, and the policy is relatively obscure, source cues can polarize public opinion substantially. However, on highly salient policies the impact of source cues may be much weaker. We report the results of three survey experiments testing the polarizing impact of a mayor as a source cue on city voters. We find strong source cue effects in each test. The often racially divisive nature of urban politics provides a fertile context for testing the polarizing impact of source cues.

Despite minimal evidence of fraud cases and non-existent effects on election outcomes, Americans continue to believe in the existence and impact of voter fraud on elections. In this paper, we examine a potentially key source of this disconnect – the U.S. news media. How the media cover voter fraud likely affects citizens’ beliefs and opinions on the subject. However, little research exists exploring voter fraud coverage. In this paper, we examine the patterns and themes of voter fraud coverage in local newspapers for each of the 50 states during the 2012 elections. Amongst the results, we show that voter identification and registration were dominant topics in coverage. Further, battleground states and states that recently passed restrictive voting laws affected which topics related to voter fraud received the most attention. Finally, we find that the number of fraud cases in each state was unrelated to voter fraud news coverage. From an agenda setting and framing standpoint, our results suggest Republicans may have been successful in making voter identification and fraud a salient issue in the news during the 2012 elections.",Brian J Fogarty (Role:Author); David C Kimball (Role:Author); Lea-Rachel Defne Kosnik (Role:Author),,,Blind Peer Reviewed,National,None,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Co-author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

We examine data from the 2020 Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Survey (CMPS), which allows for comparisons across racial groups. Reformers have emphasized the voter’s ability to have their vote transfer to a lower-ranked candidate. However, we find that a short explanation of RCV’s vote-transfer properties does not increase public support. Furthermore, when given a choice between the single and ranked voting methods, a large majority within each racial group prefers the single vote. However, Latino, Asian American, and MENA respondents express a stronger preference for RCV than white respondents. Democrats also evaluate RCV more favorably than Republicans. Furthermore, communicating that RCV helps elect more women and people of color increases support among Democrats but not Republicans among most racial groups. This is consistent with other findings around growing partisan differences in views toward diversity and descriptive representation.

David,Kimball,Did the Paris Attacks Shape American Public Opinion?,,,2019.0,,,,,Work Discontinued,,,,,Spring,2021,"We examine the impact of the Paris attacks of November 13, 2015 on American public opinion. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attacks, which killed 130 people and wounded another 368. The attacks generated a lot of attention and fueled a wave of elite rhetoric focused on immigration and national security. The Paris attacks took place roughly in the middle of the field period for the 2015 Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES). This allows for a research design that compares the attitudes of respondents interviewed before the attacks versus those interviewed after the attacks. We examine our own CCES module that included questions about immigrants and immigration policy, as well as questions from the common content portion of the survey. Furthermore, CCES records the date and time when each survey is completed, which supports a regression discontinuity design to test for shifts in public opinion after the attacks. We hypothesize that the Paris attacks had an agenda-setting effect, increasing public concern about immigration, terrorism, and national security. In addition, we test whether the attacks primed anti-immigrant predispositions when respondents were asked their opinions about national security and immigration policies.

But, to what extent do beliefs about a perpetrator’s identity shape public support for efforts to prevent and punish voter fraud? Antipathy toward racial and ethnic groups is a strong predictor of public beliefs about voter fraud. Yet, prior studies have only been able to approximate beliefs about deviant behavior, and not specifically casting an illegal ballot. Drawing from sociology and criminology, we use a “typification” strategy that more directly measures which people are perceived as typical perpetrators of casting illegal ballots. We utilize nationally representative surveys of U.S. voters in 2017 – 2020  modules of the Cooperative Election Study (CES) to  apply and empirically test the typification theory. Among white respondents, we find that the typification of racially minoritized groups such as Blacks, Latinos, Arabs, and immigrants is widespread and is strongly associated with beliefs about voter fraud, support for restrictive election policies, and harsh punishment of illegal voting. The pictures of likely criminals that white voters carry in their heads shape their preferences for crime policies, and this extends to the domain of voter fraud.</span>",David C Kimball; Adriano Anthony A Udani; Anita Marie Manion,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,National,None,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Co-author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Political rhetoric about these policies frequently links anxiety about immigration to concerns about voter fraud. However, we know relatively little about the sources of public support for election reforms that require prospective voters to show proof of citizenship, as opposed to more studied photo identification laws. We report the results of two survey experiments that test the impact of elite messages about voter fraud and immigrant threat on public support for stricter voter identification policies. We find a strong relationship between immigrant resentment and public support for voter identification restrictions, particularly proof of citizenship. Furthermore, elite messages that make claims about non-citizen voting or raise concerns about immigration boost public support for proof of citizenship laws. Thus, election reform proposals dealing with voter identification have become “immigrationalized.” ",Adriano Anthony A Udani; David C Kimball,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,National,College,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Co-author,UMSL College of Arts and Sciences,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Research teams, recruited from local colleges and universities and located in twenty-eight election jurisdictions across the United States, observed and timed voters as they entered the queue at their respective polling places and then voted. We report results about four specific polling place operations and practices: the length of the check-in line, the number of voters leaving the check-in line once they have joined it, the time for a voter to check in to vote (i.e., verify voter’s identification and obtain a ballot), and the time to complete a ballot. Long lines, waiting times, and times to vote are closely related to time of day (mornings are busiest for polling places). We found the recent adoption of photographic voter identification (ID) requirements to have a disparate effect on the time to check in among white and nonwhite polling places.

David,Kimball,Did the Paris Attacks Shape American Public Opinion?,,,2019.0,,,,,Work Discontinued,,,,,Fall,2019,"We examine the impact of the Paris attacks of November 13, 2015 on American public opinion. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attacks, which killed 130 people and wounded another 368. The attacks generated a lot of attention and fueled a wave of elite rhetoric focused on immigration and national security. The Paris attacks took place roughly in the middle of the field period for the 2015 Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES). This allows for a research design that compares the attitudes of respondents interviewed before the attacks versus those interviewed after the attacks. We examine our own CCES module that included questions about immigrants and immigration policy, as well as questions from the common content portion of the survey. Furthermore, CCES records the date and time when each survey is completed, which supports a regression discontinuity design to test for shifts in public opinion after the attacks. We hypothesize that the Paris attacks had an agenda-setting effect, increasing public concern about immigration, terrorism, and national security. In addition, we test whether the attacks primed anti-immigrant predispositions when respondents were asked their opinions about national security and immigration policies.

These elections serve as early tests of the photo ID law and offer support for some hypotheses derived from implementation theory. We find evidence of uneven implementation of the photo ID requirement in Missouri. Local jurisdictions using electronic poll books checked in a much larger volume of voters without photo ID than jurisdictions using traditional paper poll books. Interviews with local officials suggest that voter and poll worker behaviour contribute to this pattern. Furthermore, other features, particularly jurisdiction size and the administrative and partisan structure of local officials, are associated with the number of voters who check in without photo identification. Therefore, the use of electronic poll books might overstate the number of voters lacking photo identification.

David,Kimball,News Coverage of Voter Fraud in the 2012 Elections,Political Communication,,2018.0,,,,,Work Discontinued,,,,,Fall,2018,"The nature and frequency of voter fraud figure prominently in many ongoing policy debates about election laws in the United State. Policy makers frequently cite allegations of voter fraud reported in the press during these debates. While recent studies find that voter fraud is a rare event, a substantial segment of the public believes that voter fraud is a rampant problem in the United States. It stands to reason that public beliefs are shaped by news coverage of voter fraud. However, there is very little existent academic research on how the news media, at any level, cover allegations or documented cases of voter fraud. In this paper, we examine local newspaper coverage of voter fraud in each of the 50 states during the 2012 U.S. elections. Our results show that during the election season, local coverage of voter fraud was greatest in presidential swing states and states that passed restrictive voting laws during 2012. News coverage of voter fraud was much heavier before the election than after the election. We also find that the shape of news coverage varied in these states with, for instance, a higher reliance on thematic frames of voter fraud over episodic frames.

Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of glycan terminated alkanethiols on gold have found application in many of these areas. Additionally, more complex structures such as glycan modified polymers on gold surfaces have provided new routes for multivalent glycan presentation. Glycans have also been conjugated to monolayers formed on other useful substrates such as glass or silicon wafers. SAMs have been formed both by direct immobilization of glycan terminated alkanethiols and by conjugation of glycans to pre-formed SAMs with reactive terminal groups. The structure of the SAMs has been characterized using a range of methods including surface spectroscopy, scanning probe microscopy, and electrochemical methods. The binding of proteins to these SAMs has been followed using methods including surface plasmon resonance and electrochemical techniques such as impedance spectroscopy.

Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that propargyl bromide assists the reaction by creating an ionizing complex, which accelerates the leaving group departure.

Using the surface area for np-Au determined by oxide stripping, the values of kapp for the alkanethiol modified np-Au are initially over two orders of magnitude smaller than the values found on flat Au. This result provides evidence that the diffusing redox probe Fe(CN)6(3-/4-) only accesses a fraction of the np-Au surface after alkanethiol modification suggesting very limited wetting of the internal pores due to the hydrophobic nature of these surfaces. In contrast, for np-Au modified by carbohydrate-terminated (mannose or galactose) alkanethiols the values of kapp are about 10-40 fold smaller than on flat gold, suggesting more extensive access of the diffusing redox probe within the pores and better but still incomplete wetting, a result also found for modification of np-Au with mercaptododecanoic acid. A short chain PEG thiol derivative is found to result in a comparison of kapp values that suggests nearly complete wetting of the internal pores for this highly hydrophilic derivative. These results are of significance for the potential applications of SAM modified np-Au in electrochemical sensors, especially for those based on carbohydrate-protein recognition, or those of np-Au modified by SAMs with polar terminal groups.",Salvatore G Pistorio; Abeera Sharma; Jay K Bhattarai; Swati S S Nigudkar; Keith J Stine; Alexei V Demchenko,,,,,,,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

The SAMs of mannosides were prepared either pure or along with thiolated triethylene glycol (TEG) at different molar ratios (1:1, 1:2, 1:4, 1:9, and 1:19) to better understand and optimize the interaction conditions. The charge-transfer resistance of the [Fe(CN)6](3-)/(4-) redox probe was compared before and after the interaction at different concentrations of Con A to determine the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) and limit of detection (LOD). Values of Kd were found in the nanomolar range showing multivalent interactions between mannosides and Con A, and LOD was found ranging from 4-13 nM depending on the type of mannoside SAM used. Analysis using the Hill equation suggests negative cooperativity in the binding behavior. Peanut agglutinin was used as a negative control, and cyclic voltammetry was used to further support the experiments. We have found that neither the pure nor the widely dispersed monolayers of mannosides provide the conditions for optimal binding of Con A. The binding of Con A to these SAMs is sensitive to the molar ratio of the mannoside used to prepare the SAM and to the structure of the mannoside.

Researchers have noted a wide diversity in facial color patterns among species, and for several Polistes species, intraspecific variation in facial color patterns has been linked to signals of quality or individual identity. However, there have been no systematic descriptions of facial color pattern variation across the Polistes genera, limiting our understanding of the frequency of facial color patterns, how unique patterns are among species, and the degree of variation in facial color pattern within species. I photographed pinned museum specimens under visible and ultraviolet (UV) light. When few specimens were available, I included additional photos from iNaturalist, a database of citizen scientist images, resulting in a final dataset of 1,695 images from 131 species. For each species, I provide an image of a representative female face, as well as information on intraspecific variation in female facial color patterns, and sexual dimorphism of facial color patterns, when available. Facial color patterns were common across species and were composed of a mixture of yellow, red-brown, and black pigments. Patterns were similar in visible and UV images.  Spectral sensitivity curves for yellow, red-brown, and black pigmented regions have a similar shape for all Polistes species measured. Males frequently had yellow faces, and yellow male faces were correlated with sexual dimorphism. Intraspecific variation in female faces was common. Descriptions of facial color variation in Polistes will be vital to study the mechanisms driving interspecific and intraspecific diversity.</p>",Sara Elizabeth Miller (Role:Author),,,"Non-blind, Peer Reviewed",International,,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Lead / Corresponding author,DBI-1711703,,,,English,,Self-reported,
Sara,Miller,"Sex differences in deleterious genetic variants in a haplodiploid social insect<span style=""font-size:medium;""></span>",Molecular Ecology,,2023.0,,,,,Revise & Resubmit,,,,,Spring,2023,"<p>Deleterious variants are selected against but can linger in populations at low frequencies for long periods of time, decreasing fitness and contributing to disease burden in humans and other species. Deleterious variants occur at low frequency but distinguishing deleterious variants from low frequency neutral variation is challenging based on population genomics data alone. As a result, we have little sense of the number and identity of deleterious variants in wild populations. For haplodiploid species, it has been hypothesized that deleterious alleles will be directly exposed to selection in haploid males, but selection can be masked in diploid females when deleterious variants are recessive, resulting in more efficient purging of deleterious mutations in males. Therefore, comparisons of the differences between haploid and diploid genomes from the same population may be a useful method for inferring rare deleterious variants. This study provides the first formal test of this hypothesis. Using wild populations of Northern paper wasps (<em>Polistes fuscatus</em>), we find that males have fewer missense and nonsense variants per generation than females from the same population. Allele frequency differences are especially pronounced for rare missense and nonsense variants and these differences lead to a lower mutational load in males than females. Based on these data we infer that many highly deleterious mutations are segregating in the paper wasp population. Stronger selection against deleterious alleles in haploid males may have implications for adaptation in other haplodiploid insects and provides evidence that wild populations harbor abundant deleterious variants.</p>",Michael J.

Implementation of the data use model used in the present study has proved promising in European countries but has not been studied in the United States (US), where structural issues and accountability factors present different challenges. This study explored enabling and hindering factors of the intervention in an elementary school in the US to better understand how differences in context influence the work of data teams. We conclude that pairing data use efforts with high-priority initiatives may help mitigate barriers to collaboration.

Its 24 blocks were on the outskirts of St. Louis which helped it evade covenants preventing integration. The Ville, situated northwest of the city, was St. Louis’ Harlem Renaissance. Its residents, educators, doctors, nurses, laborers, and businessmen strategically built an enclave that included St. Louis Public Schools from kindergarten to college, a first-class hospital, community center, and nearby business district. Though the Ville’s inhabitants were treated as second-class citizens, they wittingly developed the neighborhood with institutions to serve the broader community by strategically organizing and leveraging the strengths of leaders in the community from all walks of life.

",American Educational History Journal,,2020.0,,,,,Completed/Published,,,,,Spring,2020,"In 1940, Ruth Harris, the first African American female president of Stowe Teachers College in St. Louis used seven principles to guide the development of the college during her tenure. One of her seven principles was communities as learning laboratories. Almost 50 years later Velez-Ibáñez developed the funds of knowledge (FoK) theory grounded in Wolf’s (1966) research on “funds” (an explanation of the resources of the poor). Both ideas advocate preservice and K-12 teachers’ community involvement to bolster the education of impoverished African American and Latinx children. The purpose of this study was twofold: first, examine Harris’ insistence on preservice teachers’ community involvement. Next, examine the intersection of FoK and Harris’ third principle to identify how the two methods influenced teacher collaboration with communities to benefit students.

Vanessa,Garry,(R) Ruth Harris' principles helped African American students beat the odds,Vitae Scholasticae,2016,2016.0,33,30-46,1,,Completed/Published,,,,,Fall,2016,"This study is a historical analysis of Ruth Harris’ leadership and her use of seven principles in the program development at Stowe Teachers College from 1940 to 1954 as gleaned from the narratives of four male alumni who attended the College during her tenure. Revisions to the Missouri constitution after the Civil War mandated that school boards educate African American children. In response, the St. Louis Public Schools Board of Education, who governed Harris Teachers College in St. Louis, Missouri (the “Whites only” teachers’ college), opened Stowe Teachers College in 1890 (named Sumner Normal) to train African American females to teach children of color. When the Board appointed Ruth Harris president of Stowe Teachers College in 1940, the veteran teacher and administrator of the College used seven principles in the development of the school and applied these points to educating future teachers. This study examines how the Stowe Teachers College alumni believe their experiences at the college influenced their professional careers and lives, beating the odds as they graduated, obtaining post graduate degrees, and advancing in their professional careers. The alumni also reveal aspects of Harris’ life through their narratives.

The emergent themes of the study affirmed previous findings from the research such as teams’ lack of time to use data, agendas to guide meetings, and norms to help keep teams on task. Other findings from this study revealed teams’ lack of knowledge about the inquiry process, inconsistency of coaches’ skills in facilitating meetings, and the absence of principals, all of which created a compelling argument for routinely monitoring or observing teams’ practices.

In 2016, more than a decade since the school closings, the enrollment dwindled from 44,000 students to half that number. This study is an examination of the closed schools to determine if displaced African American children were better off attending the replacement schools. The findings suggest SLPS’ replacement schools were not better than the shuttered schools as was predicted in the SLPS 2003 Plan. Instead, we found income imbalanced SLPS and charter schools in St. Louis had fewer children proficient on the state’s English Language Arts (ELA) assessment in comparison to their peers who participated in the Voluntary Interdistrict Transfer Program (VITP). The implications of these findings in the use of school closings as reform initiatives are discussed.

Like many African American administrators, prior to the Brown v. Board of Education decision, Harris had to creatively find ways to acquire resources. This article is an examination of her community engagement programs for preservice teachers and the African American community. Preservice teachers were intentionally immersed in the communities they would one day teach in while the community learned from well-known African Americans in a nurturing environment removed from the Jim Crow stigma prevalent during the time. Using the community as classrooms for preservice teachers and the campus for public service revealed one educator’s resourcefulness in teaching the marginalized.

Ruth Harris, President of Stowe Teachers College, educated African American teachers while, Ruth Porter, Executive Secretary of Freedom in Residence advocated for fair housing for African Americans. The first part of the paper traces Harris’ community advocacy through her preservice teachers’ volunteerism with Stowe’s St. Louis partners (i.e., Annie Malone Children’s Home, Boy Scouts of America). The second part of the paper follows Porter’s involvement in the grassroots organization Greater St. Louis Committee for Freedom in Residence. Last, at the end of the Jim Crow era, as the women’s advocacy efforts intersected, it is revealed how the change in housing policies accelerated the poverty in north St. Louis and impacted education and housing for African Americans then and now.

Buckner: Community activist from Jim Crow to post-civil rights ,Vitae Scholasticae,2017,2017.0,34,32-47,1,,Completed/Published,,,,,Summer,2017,"St. Louis Public Schools (SLPS) opened the segregated Stowe Teachers College located in St. Louis, Missouri in 1890. Both Stowe and its white counterpart, Harris Teachers College, trained women to become teachers; however, in 1930 SLPS agreed to enroll men. This historical analysis is an examination of the life of John Davis Buckner, the first male graduate of Stowe and first Charles Sumner High School (Sumner) graduate to become its principal. Sumner was the first high school for African Americans west of the Mississippi River. He was the son of Julia Davis, a longtime educator in SLPS. He first taught math at the high school before assuming the role of math curriculum specialist at the district office. He later returned to Sumner for two years as its principal before resuming his former role at SLPS’ district office. Buckner was what Michael Fultz referred to as the activist teacher because of his leadership in the community from the Jim Crow years to the early 1980s.  He served on numerous committees such as the YMCA, Annie Malone Children’s Home (now Annie Malone Children and Family Service Center), and Boy Scouts.

Consequently, we propose a dynamic perspective for understanding the relationship between voluntary organizations and neighborhood crime that involves longitudinal analyses and the measurement of the age of organizations. By using longitudinal data on a sample of census blocks (N = 87,641) located across 10 cities, we test the relationship between age-graded measures of different types of voluntary organizations and neighborhood crime rates. We use fixed-effects negative binomial regression models that focus on change within neighborhoods of the relationship between voluntary organizations and neighborhood crime. Our results show that although each type of voluntary organization is found to exhibit crime-reducing behavior in neighborhoods, we find that many of them are consistent with what we refer to as the “delayed impact scenario”—there is a pronounced delay between the placement of a voluntary organization and a neighborhood subsequently experiencing a reduction in crime. With protective effects of organizations typically not demonstrated until several years after being in the neighborhood, these patterns suggest a need for long-term investment strategies when examining organizations.",James C Wo; Adam Boessen; John R.

This paper therefore examines the role of parks for community crime, but contributes to the literature by testing whether the context of land uses and demographics nearby parks moderate the parks and crime relationship. A key feature of our approach is that we also test how these characteristics explain crime in the park, nearby the park, and in other neighborhoods in the city with data from nine cities across the United States (N=109,808 blocks). We use multilevel Poisson and negative binomial regressions to test our ideas for six types of street crime. Our findings show that nearby land uses and socio-demographic characteristics are a key driver of crime being located within the park or nearby the park. Our results also show a clear distance decay pattern for the impact of various land uses and socio-demographics nearby parks.

More social ties may be associated with less fear of crime through their role in collective action, trust, and emotional support, but also with more fear of crime because of their role in the diffusion of information on local crime patterns. In what follows, we suggest temporal and spatial distinctions in how social ties matter for fear of crime with respect to these different mechanisms.

This variability may indicate disagreement among residents with implications for the neighborhood collectivity. The authors propose using a general measure of social distance based on several social dimensions (rather than measures based on a single dimension such as racial/ethnic heterogeneity or income inequality) to help understand this variability in assessments. The authors use data from wave I (2001) of the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey (n = 3,570) to aggregate respondents into egohoods of two different sizes: quarter-mile and half-mile radii. Consistent with expectations, neighborhoods with higher levels of general social distance have higher variability in reports of neighboring and the two components of collective efficacy, cohesion and informal social control.",Seth Williams; John R Hipp; Adam M Boessen,No,,Blind Peer Reviewed,,None,,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,English,,Self-reported,4.0

We suggest that foreclosure and vacancy have distinct crime processes and their effects should be examined in tandem. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of foreclosure and vacancy, particularly in surrounding neighborhoods, may have different consequences for crime. We examine these questions using quarterly neighborhood data from Cleveland, Ohio, from 2006 to 2011 for both property and violent crimes. We find that foreclosures only impact crime through the broader nearby area, whereas vacancies appear to only be of consequence within the focal neighborhood.

Thus, there is a need to examine the scale at which the social ecology impacts crime. We use data from seven cities from around the year 2000 to test our research questions using multilevel negative binomial regression models (N = 73,010 blocks and 8,231 block groups). Our results suggest that although many neighborhood factors seem to operate on the microscale of blocks, others seem to have a much broader impact. In addition, we find that racially and ethnically homogenous blocks within heterogeneous block groups have the most crime. Our findings also show the strongest results for a multitude of land-use measures and that these measures sharpen some of the associations from social characteristics. Thus, we find that accounting for multiple scales simultaneously is important in ecological studies of crime.",John R.

The study focuses on improvement of EFL teachers instructional strategies. The main goal of the study is to develop an EFL instructional framework. The framework consists of SIOP (Sheltered instruction observation protocol) and a backward teaching and learning cycle. The backward cycle is used as a frame to implement the SIOP Model and the reflective coaching. A pilot study is conducted with the two Korean teachers who have taught five lessons in order to examine effectiveness of the framework. The pre- and post-SIOP survey data, post-conference field notes, reflective writings and five lesson plans are analyzed to see the effectiveness of the framework. The survey results show greater means in the post- evaluation. The results from the five reflective coaching cases illustrate that both participants have reached the reflective thinking step 4, experimentation, but only one has reached the step 5, evaluation, with a new conceptual schema.

organized around video resources and linguistically and culturally responsive
content teaching. The study explored an overarching research question: How did
teacher-learners in a grant project interact with a multimedia learning platform
that combined teaching video and VoiceThread presentation, called VT project,
designed to enhance their linguistically and culturally responsive content teaching
(LCRCT) for English learners (ELs)? Data included participants’ VT projects,
online and face-to-face class discussions, survey results, and final reflective papers
in two TESOL courses as part of a National Professional Development grant
program in a Midwestern University. Analyses demonstrated that the technologyassisted
course design generally promoted a critical habit of mind among teacherlearners
through opportunities to attentively notice and critically reflect on one’s
own and others’ teaching practices. Teacher-learners demonstrated a shared
ownership over their teaching processes while establishing a reflective discourse
community, where the LCRCT framework guided their learning and practices of
LCRCT for ELs. Study implications include ways for the teacher-learners to
transfer their learning from this reflective multimedia-supported TESOL program
into their classrooms, schools, and districts, as well as the challenges. The research

Three online coaching cycles were; preconference, observation of teaching videos, and post-conference. Posting frequency and exit-interview transcripts were data sources. There were two research questions: 1) What interactions occurred among online TESOL practicum course participants? and 2) What was the impact of the online TESOL practicum course on participants' EL teaching? The results showed that students interacted more among themselves than with the instructor. Three themes emerged from qualitative data analysis; acknowledgment, impact of cyclic coaching, and linguistically responsive EL-teaching.

Systematic PD should compensate for theories and pedagogies not obtained during teacher education programs yet needed for content teachers with ELLs. A study was conducted to examine 6th- to 12th-grade content teachers’ report on their instructional strategies for ELLs and their perceived attitude and role changes after they had sheltered instruction observation protocol (SIOP) training and guided coaching sessions. Two surveys and one interview were data sources for this mixed methods research design. Grounded theory was an approach adopted for qualitative data analysis, and t-tests and means were used to analyze quantitative data. The results show that most of the participating teachers perceived that they improved their instructional strategies for ELLs and attributed this improvement to SIOP and guided coaching. The results also show that most of the participants considered their roles for ELLs positively and attributed their attitude change toward ELLs and teaching strategies to PD trainings. Yet some participating teachers reported that they were still frustrated with ELLs, mostly due to their English proficiency levels.

While the public wondered whether the nude figure indeed represented Cléo de Mérode, a rising star in the ballet of the Opéra de Paris, art critics reacted with unusual vehemence to the work, labeling it a “modern” body and denouncing it as “deformed” or “damaged.” This essay examines the associations of deformity, femininity and modernity raised in the emphatic critical reception to the work. Through an investigation of the roles of the two principals in the sculpture’s production – the artist and the model – and of the critical reception to the work, it argues that this “modern” body proved troublesome to contemporary viewers, not only because it was seen as the likeness of a public celebrity, but also because the figure’s proportions resonated in complex and contradictory ways within contemporary discourses of dance, art, fashion and anthropology. The product of a collaboration between artist and model, the body portrayed in Falguière’s sculpture embodied not simply an individual dancer, but also changes in contemporary conventions governing feminine behavior – changes that were widely perceived as threatening.

It argues that modèles italiens, who had long been valued by French artists for their classical proportions and their command of the gestures that were the foundation of Christian and classical iconography, seemed to provide a connection between nineteenth-century Paris and Renaissance and antique Rome.

Low rank matrix approximation approaches have been widely used in image processing such as image denoising, which takes advantage of the idea of nonlocal self-similarity between patches in a natural image. The weighted nuclear norm minimization method as a low rank matrix approximation approach has shown to be an effective approach for image denoising. Inspired by this, we propose in this paper a MAP model with the weighted nuclear norm as a regularization constraint to remove Rician noise. The MAP data fidelity term has a Lipschitz continuous gradient and the weighted nuclear norm can be efficiently minimized. We propose an iterative weighted nuclear norm minimization algorithm (IWNNM) to solve the proposed non-convex model and analyze the convergence of our algorithm.

The short-time Fourier transform-based SST (FSST for short) reassigns the frequency variable to sharpen the time-frequency representation and to separate the components of a multicomponent non-stationary signal. Very recently the FSST with a time-varying parameter, called the adaptive FSST, was introduced.

The synchrosqueezing transform (SST) is a special type of the reassignment method which not only enhances the energy concentration of CWT in the time-frequency plane, but also separates the components of multicomponent signals. The ``bump wavelet'' and Morlet's wavelet are commonly used continuous wavelets for the wavelet-based SST. There is a parameter in these wavelets which controls the widths of the time-frequency localization window. In most literature on SST, this parameter is a fixed positive constant.

In this paper, we consider the CWT with a time-varying parameter (called the adaptive CWT) and the corresponding SST (called the adaptive SST) for multicomponent signal separation. We also introduce the second-order adaptive SST. We analyze the separation conditions for non-stationary multicomponent signals with the local approximation of linear frequency modulation mode. We derive well-separated conditions of a multicomponent signal based on the adaptive CWT. We propose methods to select the time-varying parameter so that the corresponding adaptive SSTs of the components of a multicomponent signal have sharp representations and are well-separated, and hence the components can be recovered more accurately.

To understand and process such phenomena, “divide-and-conquer” is probably the most common strategy to address the problem. In other words, the captured signal is decomposed into signal components for each individual component to be processed. Unfortunately, for signals that are superimposition of non-stationary amplitude-frequency modulated (AM-FM) components, the “divide-and-conquer” strategy is bound to fail, since there is no way to be sure that the decomposed components take on the AM-FM formulations which are necessary for the extraction of their instantaneous frequencies (IFs) and amplitudes (IAs). In this paper, we propose an adaptive signal separation operation (ASSO) for effective and accurate separation of a single-channel blind-source multi-component signal, via introducing a time-varying parameter that adapts locally to IFs and using linear chirp (linear frequency modulation) signals to approximate components at each time instant. We derive more accurate component recovery formulae based on the linear chirp signal local approximation. In addition, a recovery scheme, together with a ridge detection method, is also proposed to extract the signal components one by one, and the time-varying parameter is updated for each component. The proposed method is suitable for engineering implementation, being capable of separating complicated signals into their components or sub-signals and reconstructing the signal trend directly.

It is essential to extract a time-frequency (TF) characteristics in such signals for an accurate description. Two parameters are usually applied to quantify the TF characteristics of a nonstationary signal, i.e., instantaneous frequency (IF) and group delay (GD). A post-processing strategy was adopted by two recently developed techniques, the synchrosqueezing transform (SST) and the time-reassigned SST (TSST) to accurately capture the change rules of IF and GD respectively. However, due to the diversity of modes in complex nonstationary signals, no existing technique has been used to effectively estimate both IF and GD simultaneously. To solve this problem, a post-processing analysis technique termed as time-frequency-multisqueezing transform (TFMST) is proposed in this paper where a so-called chirp rate (CR) discrimination criterion is established by considering Gaussian window in short-time Fourier transform. The proposed method can accurately categorize nonstationary signals containing harmonic- and impulsive-like components to achieve a concurrent description and ensure the recovery of original signals.

However, convolution-free vision Transformers (ViTs) have recently outperformed CNN-based models in image recognition. Despite this progress, building and designing video Transformers have not yet obtained the same attention in research as image-based Transformers. While there have been attempts to build video Transformers by adapting image-based Transformers for video understanding, these Transformers still lack efficiency due to the large gap between CNN-based models and Transformers regarding the number of parameters and the training settings. In this work, we propose three techniques to improve video understanding with video Transformers. First, to derive better spatiotemporal feature representation, we propose a new spatiotemporal attention scheme, termed synchronized spatiotemporal and spatial attention (SSTSA), which derives the spatiotemporal features with temporal and spatial multiheaded self-attention (MSA) modules. It also preserves the best spatial attention by another spatial self-attention module in parallel, thereby resulting in an effective Transformer encoder. Second, a motion spotlighting module is proposed to embed the short-term motion of the consecutive input frames to the regular RGB input, which is then processed with a single-stream video Transformer. Third, a simple intraclass frame interlacing method of the input clips is proposed that serves as an effective video augmentation method. Finally, our proposed techniques have been evaluated and validated with a set of extensive experiments in this study.

The continuous wavelet transform (CWT)-based SST sharpens the time-frequency representation of a non-stationary signal by assigning the scale variable of the signal’s CWT to the frequency variable by a reference IF function. Since the SST method is applied to estimate the IFs of all frequency components of a signal based on one single reference IF function, it may yield not very accurate results. In this paper we introduce the instantaneous frequency-embedded synchrosqueezing wavelet transform (IFE-SST). IFE-SST uses a rough estimation of the IF of a targeted component to produce accurate IF estimation. The reference IF function of IFE-SST is associated with the targeted component. Our numerical experiments show that IFE-SST outperforms the CWT-based SST in IF estimation and separation of multicomponent signals.

A set of filters are canonical if the filters in this set are generated by flipping, adding a conjugation with a proper sign adjusting from one filter. The simplest way to construct wavelets of s-variables is to use the 2(s) - 1 canonical filters generated by the refinement mask of a box spline. However, almost all wavelets (except Haar or the tensor product of Haar) defined by the canonical filters associated with box splines do not form a tight wavelet frame system. We consider how to build a filter bank by adding filters to a canonical filter set generated from the refinement mask of a box spline in low dimension, so that the wavelet system generated by this filter bank forms a tight frame system. We first prove that for a given low dimension box spline of s-variables, one needs at least additional 2(s) filters to be added to the canonical filters from the refinement mask (that leads to the total number of highpass filters in the filter bank to be 2(s+1) - 1) to have a tight wavelet frame system. We then provide several methods with many interesting examples of constructing tight wavelet systems with the minimal number of framelets that contain canonical filters generated by the refinement masks of box splines. The supports of the resulting framelets are not bigger than that of the corresponding box spline whose refinement mask is used to generate the first 2(s) - 1 canonical filters in the filter bank. In many of our examples, the tight frame filter bank has the double-canonical property, meaning it is generated by adding another set of canonical filters generated from a highpass filter to the canonical filters generated by the refinement mask to make a tight frame system.

The estimation process in this method consists of three components: a random projection procedure that generates partitions of the feature space, a wavelet-like   orthogonal system defined on a tree that allows for a thresholding estimation of the regression function based on that tree and, finally, an averaging process that averages a number of estimates from independently generated random projection trees.

We use  a kernel function-based complex quadratic phase function to represent a multicomponent signal in the three-dimensional space of time, frequency and chirp rate, to be called the localized quadratic-phase Fourier transform (LQFT). We analyze the error bounds for IF estimation and component recovery with LQFT. In addition,

Based on the approximation of source signals with linear frequency modulation modes at any local time, we introduce an innovative signal reconstruction algorithm which is suitable for signals with crossing IFs. Moreover, this algorithm decreases component recovery errors when the IFs curves of different components are not crossover, but fast-varying and close to one and other.

Impulsive noise is aroused mainly by outside factors, which bring enormous difficulties for signal processing, especially for multicomponent non-stationary signal representation and separation. The synchrosqueezing transform (SST) is a time-frequency (TF) analysis method with high energy concentration and inverse transform. SST and its variants have been used for instantaneous frequency estimation and modes recovery in many applications. But these methods are unable to represent the non-stationary signal separately and clearly under impulsive noise. In this paper, we model the impulsive noise with the alpha-stable distribution, which satisfies the generalized central limit theorem. Based on the short-time Fourier transform (STFT), we proposed the fractional lower-order SST with adaptive order and adaptive window for multicomponent signal separation with single-channel observation, called the adaptive window and fractional lower order SST (AWO-SST). Moreover, we consider the second-order phase transformation for AWO-SST and provide a component recovery method under adaptive parameters.

In many situations we need to separate these signals to a finite number of monocomponents to represent the intrinsic modes and underlying dynamics implicated in the source signals. 
Recently the synchrosqueezing transform (SST) was developed as an empirical mode decomposition (EMD)-like tool to enhance the time-frequency resolution and energy concentration of a multi-component non-stationary signal and provides more accurate component recovery.  To recover individual component,  the SST method consists of two steps. First the  instantaneous frequency (IF) of a component is estimated from the SST plane. Secondly,  after IF is recovered, the associated component is computed by a definite integral along the estimated IF curve on the SST plane.  The reconstruction accuracy for a component depends heavily on the accuracy of the IFs estimation carried out in the first step. 

More recently, a direct method of the time-frequency approach, called signal separation operation (SSO), was introduced for multi-component signal separation. While both SST and SSO are mathematically rigorous on IF estimation, SSO avoids the second step of the two-step SST method in signal separation. In the present paper, we solve the inverse problem by constructing an adaptive signal separation operator (ASSO)

The SSO method is based the short-time Fourier transform. In this paper we propose a direct  method of signal separation based on the adaptive continuous wavelet transform (CWT). We introduce two models of the adaptive CWT-based approach for signal separation: the sinusoidal signal-based model and the linear frequency modulation signal-based model. We present the theoretical analysis of our approach. For each model, we establish the error bounds for  IF estimation and component recovery. ",Charles K.

Recently, the synchrosqueezed wavelet  transform (SST) and its variants have been developed to estimate instantaneous frequencies and separate the components of  non-stationary multicomponent signals.

The short-time Fourier transform-based SST (FSST for short) reassigns the frequency variable to sharpen the time-frequency representation and to separate the components of a multicomponent non-stationary signal. However FSST works well only with multicomponent signals having slowly changing frequencies. To deal with multicomponent signals having fast-changing frequencies, the 2nd-order FSST (FSST2 for short) was proposed. 
The key point for FSST2 is to construct a phase transformation of a signal which is the instantaneous frequency when the signal is a linear chirp. In this paper we introduce a new phase transformation for FSST2 which is simpler than those used in the literature. We study the theoretical analysis of FSST2 with this new phase transformation.

Hence-forth, even if two IF curves cross, the two corresponding signal components can still be separated and recovered, provided that their chirp rates are different. In other words, signal components with the same IF value at any time instant could still be recovered. To facilitate our presentation, we introduce the notion of time-scale-chirp_rate  (TSC_R) recovery transform or TSC\_R recovery operator to develop a TSC_R theory for the  3-dimensional space of  time, scale, chirp rate. Our theoretical development is based on the approximation of the non-stationary signal components with linear chirps and applying the proposed adaptive TSC_R transform to the multi-component blind-source signal to obtain fairly accurate error bounds of IF estimations and signal components recovery.

The relationship between these two methods has been studied recently.  This relationship leads to new types of diffusion equations and helps to design the wavelet/frame-inspired diffusivity functions, and on the other hand it helps to design the diffusion-inspired shrinkage functions with a better performance in signal and image denoising. 

Multiwavelets have important properties such as orthogonality, short support, 
and symmetry, etc. that scalar orthogonal wavelets cannot possess simultaneously.  There is rich literature on the theoretical study, construction and applications of multiwavelets.  In particular, it has been shown that multiwavelets perform better than the scalar wavelets in signal and image denoising.  Recently multiwavelet denoising has been applied in different applications including  rolling bearing fault detection and study of load spectrum of computer numerical control lathe. Therefore it is worth to further study multiwavelet denoising. 

In this paper we investigate the correspondence between multiwavelet denoising and nonlinear diffusion. We show that the multiwavelet shrinkages of the commonly used CL(2) and DGHM multiwavelets are associated with a second-order nonlinear diffusion equation. We also derive high-order nonlinear diffusion equations associated with general multiwavelet shrinkages. The experimental results carried out in this paper show that the diffusion-inspired multiwavelet shrinkage performs better than the traditional multiwavelet hard- and soft-thresholding shrinkages.

In particular, SST  performs very well in estimating instantaneous frequencies (IFs) and separating the components of  non-stationary multicomponent signals with slowly changing frequencies. However its performance is not desirable for signals having fast-changing frequencies. Two approaches have been proposed for this issue. One is  to use the 2nd-order or high-order SST, and the other is to apply the instantaneous frequency-embedded SST (IFE-SST).  For the SST or high order SST approach, one single phase transformation  is applied to estimate the IFs of all components of a signal, which may yield not very accurate results  in IF estimation and component recovery. 

IFE-SST uses an estimation of the IF of a targeted component to produce accurate IF estimation. The phase transformation of IFE-SST is associated with the targeted component. Hence the IFE-SST has certain advantages over SST in IF estimation and signal separation. In this paper, we provide theoretical study on the instantaneous frequency-embedded short-time Fourier transform (IFE-STFT) and the associated SST, called IFE-FSST.

However, while extremely useful, this notion is not without significant moral and ethical challenges, which has been noted by scholars. This article is a short intellectual history of the idea of cultural evolution and its critics, the cultural relativists, from the Age of the Enlightenment, what David Deutsch called the “beginning of infinity,” to the neo-Hegelianism of Francis Fukuyama. The emphasis here is on Europe and the Americas and the argument is that the universal evolutionism of the Enlightenment ultimately prevailed over historical partic-ularism, as global disparities in social development, which were once profound, narrowed or even disappeared altogether.",Kevin Fernlund (Role:Author),,,Blind Peer Reviewed,International,,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Lead / Corresponding author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Selahattin,Dibooglu,Engines of Growth in China: The Limits of Informal Institutions ,Journal of Economic Issues,,2017.0,,,,,Revise & Resubmit,,,,,Spring,2018,"Since the 1978 reforms, China has experienced rapid economic and social development. GDP growth has been in the double digits on average yearly, creating the fastest sustained economic growth recorded by a major economy in history. Not only did this transform the economy and society at large, China reached important milestones in terms of reducing poverty in a short period of time. This paper uses the tools of new institutional economics to examine China’s economic growth and how the growth has been achieved by informal substitutes for economic and political institutions. The trajectory by which these substitutes have left their imprint on China’s complex economic landscape and how they can constrain future economic growth are also of central importance. After examining decentralization and risk management practices, property rights, and the legal system, we emphasize the importance of creating formal institutions necessary for long-term growth, most importantly innovation. This lack of innovation is evident in China’s declining total factor productivity which must be reversed if China is to enjoy long-term sustained growth.",Christopher Cunningham; Selahattin Dibooglu,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,,,,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Empirical results suggest that the monetary policy is consistent with the Taylor rule in all countries except for India and all countries followed both low and high inflation targeting monetary policy regimes. Low inflation targeting regime seems to be more persistent and has higher duration than high inflation targeting regimes except for Indonesia and South Africa. All countries seems to have had financial stability concerns when they formulated their monetary policy as the coefficient for financial stress index is statistically significant at least in one regime. Overall the results in this paper suggest that Taylor rule based monetary policies have been implemented to various degrees in major emerging economies to achieve economic stability, price stability, and financial stability.",Selahattin Dibooglu; Yasemin Yurtkur; Nuket Kirci-Cevik,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,,,,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Throughout the crisis, the financial system experienced an elevated level of volatility and heightened risk premiums. We use a time-varying volatility and a variance risk premium approach to capture features observed during the GFC. Our model generates superior undercapitalization measures due to its time-varying volatility and risk premiums. Moreover the empirical results correctly identify the most systemically risky banks during the GFC compared to alternative models.

Using weekly data from 1990-2017 and time varying causality-in-mean and causality-in-variance tests and taking into account structural breaks, we model each series as an EGARCH process in order to capture any leverage effects in the volatility of returns. Empirical results suggest crude oil prices as measured by Brent benchmark have significant effects on stock market returns in Turkey. While we fail to document significant spillover effects stemming from oil prices in the entire sample, there are significant spillover effects from crude oil price changes to stock market returns in 1993 and 2008-09. These results suggest that government policies must take into account risk spillover effects between markets and that investors are better off monitoring crude oil markets in portfolio allocation decisions.",Nuket Kirci-Cevik; Emrah I Cevik; Selahattin Dibooglu,,,,,,,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

We use the National Financial Conditions Index constructed by the Chicago FED in order to test whether financial stability concerns enter monetary policy formulations in the US. We model nonlinearity in monetary policy by a Markov regime-switching model. The results show that the monetary policy implemented by the FED can be characterized as a two-state (active and passive monetary policy) Markov process and financial instability significantly increases the likelihood of regime-switching from passive to active monetary policy. Moreover the likelihood of FED’s monetary policy regime switch between passive and active monetary policy seems to increase when a certain threshold level of the financial condition index is reached. Finally, our results seem to be robust to alternative specifications of the reaction function and different forms of non-linearity.",Emrah Cevik; Selahattin Dibooglu; Durmus Yidirim; Seyfettin Erdogan,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,,None,Working paper,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Lead / Corresponding author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

This line of inquiry can be further refined by examining the unique effects of residential movement, housing location, and household composition on reentry trajectories. To address these questions, we use a sample of men and women released from prison in Missouri. Consistent with past research, men are more likely to fail overall, but women are more likely to be recommitted to prison for a technical violation. We find that community context had the largest effect in models of technical violations for the male sample. Similar community effects were not observed for the female sample. Family support was a strong protective factor for men and women. We discuss the policy implications of the study for prisoner reentry in general and the import for a gendered understanding of recidivism.

Objective: This study examines how the transition to adulthood may affect the association between food security and self-rated health and healthcare needs for individuals with disabilities.
Methods: The study uses five years of data (2011–2015) from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). One health indicator, self-rated health status, and two indicators of unmet healthcare needs, delayed medical care and not receiving medical care due to cost, are analyzed as dependent variables. The effects of food security status on health and health-related outcomes are closely examined for the four groups: youth without disabilities, youth with disabilities, young adults without disabilities and young adults with disabilities.
Results: Results indicate a statistically significant association between food security status and self-rated health and unmet healthcare needs in late childhood and young adulthood. Such association is stronger for young adults than for youth. The association between low food security and self-rated health and health-related outcomes does not significantly differ between the two youth groups or the two young adult groups by disability status.
Conclusions: Suggestions for improving accessibility of public food and nutrition programs are discussed. The study also suggests the importance of creating a healthcare system that benefits every member of the society.",Shirley Lynn Porterfield; Jin Huang; Baorong Guo,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,National,Research Board,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Lead / Corresponding author,University of Kentucky Center on Poverty Research & USDA Economic Research Service,,,,English,,WOS,

Methods: The study uses a repeated cross-sectional design with five years of data (2011–2015) from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) in the US. The difference-in-difference approach is applied to compare individuals with and without disabilities regarding their food security status in adolescence and young adulthood. Instrumental Variable analyses are conducted using state SNAP policy rules as exogenous instruments to estimate the effects of SNAP participation on food security status for youth and young adults with disabilities.
Results: Results indicate that transition into adulthood results in greater food security for individuals without disabilities but an increased risk of low food security for individuals with disabilities. The increased risk for young adults with disabilities may well put them at very low food security, the most severe category on the food security scale. SNAP participation appears to have greater impacts for youth than for young adults.
Conclusions: Since food security likely has a profound impact on the long-term development, economic independence, and self-sufficiency, we discuss a few policy strategies that may help individuals with disabilities in their transition to adulthood.",Jin Huang; Shirley Lynn Porterfield; Baorong Guo,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,National,Research Board,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Lead / Corresponding author,University of Kentucky Center on Poverty Research & USDA Economic Research Service,,,,English,,WOS,

During the negative polaron transport, due to the external light field, the polaron, which is re-excited and induces deep localization, also forms a new local distortion of the alternating bonds. It is revealed that the excited polaron moves more slowly than the ground-state polaron. Furthermore, the velocity of the polaron moving along the polymer chain is crucially dependent on the photoexcitation. With an increase in the intensity of the optical field, the localization of the excited polaron will be deepened, with a decrease of the polaron's velocity. It is discovered that, for a charged carrier, photoexcitation is a significant factor in reducing the efficiency during the charged carrier transport in polymer solar cells. Mostly, the deep trapping effect of charged carrier in composite conjugated polymer solar cell presents an opportunity for the future application in nanoscale memory and imaging devices.

Although the timescale of excitonic radiative decay has been narrowed less than a nanosecond, the nonadiabatic mechanism presented in this article is able to provide a detailed depiction of the fluorescence dynamics with respect to singlet exciton decay and the evolution of the dipole moment. Simultaneously, it is found that the lifetime of the singlet exciton ranges from around 500 picoseconds to one nanosecond, which is in line with recent experimental observations on polymers such as benzothiadiazole and thiophene.

Yet, under strong external electric filed/high voltages, there is a certain degree of efficiency roll-off. For this paradox, this article reveals the following underlying mechanism: Under a low electric field, a charged polaron is driven to the potential well created by an exciton, where they fuse together to form a ""charged exciton"". The carrier fusion induces the triplet state to fluoresce, which greatly enhances the performance of the device (ideally, the internal quantum efficiency can exceed 95%). As long as the external field continues to increase and surpasses 4.5 x 10(4)V/cm, the above confinement is broken, and the polaron also steps out of the potential well, which leads to a major setback of the overall device efficiency. Then, when the electric field reaches as high as 0.8 MV/cm, the original exciton is dissociated. For achieving highly efficient fluorescent PLEDs, it is seen that the appropriate electric field magnitude ranges from 5 x 10(2) to 2 x 10(4) V/cm.

The scale was originally designed for written narratives, and many studies now use this scale for audio-visual (AV) stimuli, under the assumption that the scale performs the same across the different mediums. We explore if the scale does in fact perform the same in relation to written versus audio-visual narratives. In Study 1, 125 participants are exposed to one of two versions (print or video) of the same narrative. A confirmatory factor analysis indicates that the scale is not unidimensional and the factor structure is not consistent between print and video formats. Follow-up questions show that those participants who viewed the film version were puzzled by items in the scale that asked about their ability to imagine what they had seen. A new 6-item short form of the scale was also tested. Measurement invariance across the print and video groups was not supported. Citation: Riggs, E. E., & Knobloch-Westerwick, S. (2022).

It conceptualizes a model for audience members' parasocial interaction and identification with cast members and explores antecedents and outcomes of parasocial interaction and identification. Data analysis suggests the following direct relationships: (1) audience members' exposure to the show is positively associated with parasocial interaction, which in turn is positively associated with identification, (2) parasocial interaction is positively associated with exercise self-efficacy, whereas identification is negatively associated with exercise self-efficacy, and (3) exercise self-efficacy is positively associated with exercise behavior. Indirect effects of parasocial interaction and identification on exercise self-efficacy and exercise behavior are also significant. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings.

Follow-up questions show that those participants who viewed the film version were puzzled by items in the scale that asked about their ability to imagine what they had seen. A new 6-item short form of the scale was also tested. Measurement invariance across the print and video groups was not supported.

Norman,Womer,Multi-Period Stochastic Resource Planning in Professional Service Organizations,Decision Sciences,,2019.0,,,April,,Completed/Published,,,,,Spring,2019,"Resource planning (RP) in a professional service organization (PSO) matches workforce resources with project tasks while considering a myriad of factors such as skill requirements, service delivery role, skill type, workforce proficiency level and geographical location. The multi-period stochastic resource planning (MPSRP) studied in this paper extends the one-period deterministic RP by explicitly coping with both internal resource attrition and project demand uncertainty in a sequential decision-making framework. It allows resource managers to make effective use of their internal resources and identify the need to outsource to external contingent resources. We model the MPSRP as a Markov decision process (MDP) and implement an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm to obtain dynamic and adaptive solutions in reasonable computation times. A comprehensive computational study shows that our ADP algorithm achieves higher profitability and internal resource utilization compared to the rolling horizon approach used as a benchmark.

Here the prototype DDX manpower scheduling problem is modeled as a project scheduling problem with multi-purpose resources (PSMPR) where multi-skilled sailors form teams to accomplish interrelated onboard tasks. A hybrid decomposition algorithm that incorporates both constraint programming (CP) and tabu search (TS) metaheuristic is developed for solving this NP-hard problem. In computational experiments, the performance of our hybrid algorithm is tested and compared with solutions found using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) with CPLEX and with lower bounds obtained from a bin packing problem with conflicts (BPC).Key words: manpower scheduling; resource-constrained project scheduling; constraint programming; tabu search; hybrid approach",H.

The approach is to model a sailors sequence of jobs as a supply chain. The contribution of this effort is to introduce supply chain management as a way of thinking about the problem. Each command receives a sailors services but that command also invests in the sailor by providing training and experience. It is this investment activity that makes the sailor more valuable to commands later in the supply chain. An optimal system will encourage commands to invest in sailor attributes that are desired by other commands with jobs later in the supply chain. The model that is outlined in this paper measures the value of assigning a sailor to a particular job early enough to encourage this investment while recognizing the inputs of all relevant stakeholders.,,,,,,Research Board,,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,Personnel Research Science,,,,,,FAS and other legacy systems,

These soluble Aβ species, including oligomers and protofibrils, have been well-studied in vitro and are formed via non-covalent self-assembly of Aβ monomers. While both 40- and 42-residue forms of Aβ are observed in the human body, the majority of the Aβ aggregation work has been conducted on Aβ42 or Aβ40 separately, with relatively few investigations of mixtures. In order to study the effect of different combinations of Aβ40 and Aβ42 on protofibril formation, mixtures of either dry solid peptide, or purified Aβ40 and Aβ42 monomer solutions were mixed together and protofibril/monomer distributions were quantified. Increases in the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio increased protofibril formation but the presence of Aβ40 in the mixed Aβ solutions had a significant negative impact on protofibril formation compared to equivalent solutions of pure Aβ42. Protofibril size was less affected, but β-sheet structure increased with protofibrils formed from higher Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio solutions. Direct measurement of Aβ42/Aβ40 ratios by C-terminal-selective ELISA found very little Aβ40 incorporated into protofibrils.

This paper revisits that initial 1994 benefit cost analysis; background on its methods and assumptions is given, comparisons are made to current state-of-the-art techniques in benefit cost analysis, and an ex post benefit cost analysis of the project is conducted for comparison purposes.  We find that the cost and scope of the project exceeded original expectations, the cost of the foregone electricity generation was less than expected and that anticipated recreational and fisheries benefits were both delayed, and lower, than expected.  Further, issues such as the value of hatchery-spawned versus wild anadromous fish seem not to have been anticipated in the original analysis, highlighting the fact that in doing an ex-ante analysis, researchers must expect that unexpected factors may influence the ex-post results of any project.",Lea-Rachel Defne Kosnik; Allen Bellas,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,International,None,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Lead / Corresponding author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,
Lea-Rachel,Kosnik,An Aggregation Effect in Behavioral Decision-Making,,,2006.0,,,,,Work Discontinued,,,,,Spring,2020,"Over the past several decades, behavioral economics research has called the neoclassical rational-choice theory for behavioral decision-making into question with evidence of empirical anomalies that include preference reversals and willingness-to-pay/willingness-to-accept gaps.   While an intriguing job has been done in discovering many of the irregularities in behavioral choice, there is as yet no consistent and widely accepted theory uniting behavioral economic findings.  In addition, many of the documented irregularities have been shown to disappear over time, through repeated trials, or in particular institutional contexts, thus calling into question the applied relevance of behavioral findings.  The research advanced in this paper suggests a bridge for understanding the appropriate applicable contexts for behavioral- and rational-choice theoretic models.  A hypothesis is presented that the difference in predictive power between rational- and behavioral-choice theories can in part be explained with a subtle appreciation of the distinctions between aggregated and non-aggregated decision-making contexts.  Through meta-analysis studies and experimental economics survey trials, identification of the variables that are important in transitioning from non-aggregated (where behavioral models apply) to aggregated (where traditional rational-choice theory applies) choice-contexts, and the comparative statics related to their change, will be investigated.

This paper investigates whether academic research attention to certain public policy related measures (including unemployment, inflation, bankruptcies, and GDP) is correlated with empirical measurements of the measures themselves.  In other words, when unemployment rises, does academic research attention to the matter increase?  Or do economists pursue research interests relatively uninfluenced by policy shocks on the ground, at least in the short run?  Text-analysis based results imply that economic attention to key public policy terms does correlate with empirical movements of the terms in most instances, however, the stronger and more consistent correlation is between use of public policy terms in the academic literature and discussion of them by the broader public.

Understanding the media’s response to market based policy mechanisms is important for understanding their ultimate acceptance, or rejection, beyond the academic sphere.

Despite minimal evidence of fraud cases and non-existent effects on election outcomes, Americans continue to believe in the existence and impact of voter fraud on elections. In this paper, we examine a potentially key source of this disconnect – the U.S. news media. How the media cover voter fraud likely affects citizens’ beliefs and opinions on the subject. However, little research exists exploring voter fraud coverage. In this paper, we examine the patterns and themes of voter fraud coverage in local newspapers for each of the 50 states during the 2012 elections. Amongst the results, we show that voter identification and registration were dominant topics in coverage. Further, battleground states and states that recently passed restrictive voting laws affected which topics related to voter fraud received the most attention. Finally, we find that the number of fraud cases in each state was unrelated to voter fraud news coverage.

A common manifestation of this is positivity bias, where male-authored articles are more likely to portray results as “novel” and “progressive,” as compared to female-authored articles. Such positively marketed research has been found to affect citation rates over time. This research extends the investigation into writing styles in academic economic publications by creating and testing two new sentiment scores along other dimensions: a certainty/tentativeness sentiment score, and a contemporary/past sentiment score.

Lea-Rachel,Kosnik,The Local and Aggregated Impacts of Stay-at-Home Orders on State Level Unemployment Outcomes,Eastern Economic Journal,,2022.0,,,,,In Press,,,,,Spring,2023,"By early April, 2020, the vast majority of states in the U.S. had implemented stay-at-home-orders (SAHO) in response to the coronavirus pandemic. This public policy response was not without controversy, nor expected benefits and costs to health care and the economy (Greenstone and Nigam, 2020; Thunstrom et al., 2020). Eight months after the fact, this paper analyzes the effect of state-wide SAHOs on week-by-week unemployment measures, including jobless claims and unemployment rates. Initial research put out early in the summer of 2020 found conflicting effects of the SAHOs on state-wide unemployment rates. This research helps to clarify the debate by investigating more than one measure of unemployment, and doing so in an econometrically robust manner. We find that implementing a state-wide SAHO significantly impacted state unemployment measures, however, what was of even greater significance, was the nationwide percentage of states with SAHOs in effect. This subtle result implies that SAHOs were certainly impactful, but most especially from a national perspective. While these results do not imply that SAHOs should never have been issued, as any proper benefit-cost analysis would look at the full picture of a policy action and not just its costs, this research does help to clarify the impact of SAHOs on various measures of U.S. unemployment.",Lea-Rachel Defne Kosnik (Role:Author); Allen Bellas (Role:Author),,,Blind Peer Reviewed,International,None,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Co-author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

News coverage of voter fraud was much heavier before the election than after the election. We also find that the shape of news coverage varied in these states with, for instance, a higher reliance on thematic frames of voter fraud over episodic frames.

Lea-Rachel,Kosnik,Gender and Network Analysis in the Literature,,,2022.0,,,,,In Progress,,,,,Spring,2023,"In recent years there has been an increasing level of attention paid to gender effects in the economics profession.  Much of this attention has gone to pointing out the heterogeneous treatment of the genders in aspects as diverse as publishing, citing and credit allocation, tenure and promotion, teaching evaluations, pay, textbook representation, and discriminatory based language.  All of this valuable work has begun to shine a light on the hitherto fore ignored gender disparities in the profession.

This paper continues the inquiry into gender differences in the economics profession with a text-based content analysis of academic economics research from 1969-2018.  Comprising a database of 16,827 articles published in the top five journals in the field (AER, E,JPE, QJE, RES), this research explores thematic differences and authorial networking differences, by gender, of academic publications.  

All of this matters not just from a diversity perspective, but because the focus of the profession’s top published research articles affects the wider conversation; it is what policy makers and practitioners pay attention to and promote.  The AEA report on climate in the profession (Campbell et al., 2018) recommended “making data available” on gender-related issues to help reduce bias and inform the profession.  This research aids in that goal. Results found can help in “identify[ing] best practices to avoid both conscious and unconscious biases.”

As top-level scholars age, their writing style increasingly differs from others’. The impact (measured by citations) of each contribution decreases, due to the direct effect of age and the much smaller indirect effects through style. Non-native English speakers write in a different style from others, in ways that reduce the impact of their research. Scholars produce less top-flight work as they age, especially those who have produced less in the recent past, whose work is less cited, and whose styles have been more positive.

As TAG is produced from diacylglycerol (DAG), successful engineering strategies to enhance TAG levels have focused on the conversion of DAG to TAG. However, the production of TAG can be limited by flux through the enzymatic reactions that supply DAG. In this study, two Arabidopsis phospholipase Dζ genes (AtPLDζ1 and AtPLDζ2 ) were coexpressed in Camelina sativa to test whether the conversion of phosphatidylcholine to DAG impacts TAG levels in seeds. The resulting transgenic plants produced 2% to 3% more TAG as a component of total seed biomass and had increased 18:3 and 20:1 fatty acid levels relative to wild type. Increased DAG and decreased PC levels were examined through the kinetics of lipid assembly by [(14)C]acetate and [(14)C]glycerol incorporation into glycerolipids. [(14)C]acetate was rapidly incorporated into TAG in both wild-type and overexpression lines, indicating a significant flux of nascent and elongated acyl-CoAs into the sn-3 position of TAG. Stereochemical analysis revealed that newly synthesized fatty acids were preferentially incorporated into the sn-2 position of PC, but the sn-1 position of de novo DAG and indicated similar rates of nascent acyl groups into the Kennedy pathway and acyl editing. [(14)C]glycerol studies demonstrated PC-derived DAG is the major source of DAG for TAG synthesis in both tissues.

Here we show that manipulation of the non-specific phospholipase C1, NPC1, alters silicon content in nodes and husks of rice (Oryza sativa). Silicon content in NPC1-overexpressing (OE) plants was decreased in nodes but increased in husks compared to wild-type whereas RNAi suppression of NPC1 resulted in opposite changes to those of NPC1-OE plants. NPC1 from rice hydrolyzed phospholipids and galactolipids to generate diacylglycerol that can be phosphorylated to phosphatidic acid. Phosphatidic acid interacts with Lsi6, a silicon transporter that is expressed at the highest level in nodes. In addition, the node cells of NPC1-OE plants have lower contents of cellulose and hemicellulose, and thinner sclerenchyma and vascular bundle fibre cells than wild-type plants; whereas NPC1-RNAi plants displayed the opposite changes. These data indicate that NPC1 modulates silicon distribution and secondary cell wall deposition in nodes and grains, affecting mechanical strength and seed shattering.

In response to Pi deprivation, one prominent metabolic adaptation in plants is the decrease in membrane phospholipids that consume approximately one-third cellular Pi. The level of two phospholipid-hydrolyzing enzymes, phospholipase Dζ2 (PLDζ2) and non-specific phospholipase C4 (NPC4), is highly induced in Pi-deprived Arabidopsis. To determine the role of PLDζ2 and NPC4 in plant growth under Pi limitation, Arabidopsis plants deficient in both PLDζ2 and NPC4 (npc4pldζ2) were generated and characterized. Lipid remodeling in leaves and roots was analyzed at three different durations of Pi deficiency. NPC4 affected lipid changes mainly in roots at an early stage of Pi deprivation, whereas PLDζ2 exhibited a more overt effect on lipid remodeling in leaves at a later stage of Pi deprivation. Pi deficiency-induced galactolipid increase and phospholipid decrease were impeded in pldζ2 and npc4pldζ2 plants. In addition, seedlings of npc4pldζ2 had the same root hair density as pldζ2 but shorter root hair length than pldζ2 in response to Pi deficiency. The loss of NPC4 decreased root hair length but had no effect on root hair density. These data suggest that PLDζ2 and NPC4 mediate the Pi deprivation-induced lipid remodeling in a tissue- and time-specific manner. PLDζ2 and NPC4 have distinctively different roles in root hair growth and development in response to Pi deprivation; PLDζ2 negatively modulates root hair density and length, whereas NPC4 promotes root hair elongation.",Yuan Su; Maoyin Li; Liang Guo; Xuemin Wang,,,"Non-blind, Peer Reviewed",,Research Board,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Lead / Corresponding author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

The role and regulation of TOR-S6K in lipid metabolism remained unknown in plants. Here we provide genetic and pharmacological evidence that TOR-Raptor2-S6K1 is important for thylakoid galactolipid biosynthesis and thylakoid grana modeling in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Genetic suppression of S6K1 caused pale yellow-green leaves, defective thylakoid grana architecture. S6K1 directly interacts with Raptor2, a core component in TOR signaling, and S6K1 activity is regulated by Raptor2 and TOR. Plants with suppressed Raptor2 expression or reduced TOR activity by inhibitors mimicked the S6K1-deficient phenotype. A significant reduction in galactolipid content was found in the s6k1, raptor2 mutant or TOR-inhibited plants, which was accompanied by decreased transcript levels of the set of genes such as lipid phosphate phosphatase α5 (LPPα5), MGDG synthase 1 (MGD1), and DGDG synthase 1 (DGD1) involved in galactolipid synthesis, compared to the control plants. Moreover, loss of LPPα5 exhibited a similar phenotype with pale yellow-green leaves.

In this study, a sulfoquinovosyl transferase-like protein, designated as SQD2.2 involved in seed setting and flavonoid accumulation, was identified and characterized in rice. Rice SQD2.2 is localized to the cytoplasm, and the SQD2.2 transcript was highest in leaves. Rice SQD2.2-overexpressing (OE) plants exhibited a decreased seed setting rate and diminished tiller number simultaneously with an increased glycosidic flavonoid level compared with wild-type (WT) plants. SQD2.2 catalyzes the glycosylation of apigenin to produce apigenin 7-O-glucoside using uridine diphosphate-glucose (UDPG) as a sugar donor, but it failed to compensate for sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol (SQDG) synthesis in the Arabidopsis sqd2 mutant. Furthermore, apigenin 7-O-glucoside inhibited starch synthase (SS) activity in a concentration-dependent manner, and SQD2.2-OE plants exhibited reduced SS activity accompanied by a significant reduction in starch levels and an elevation in soluble sugar levels relative to WT plants. Both adenosine diphosphate-glucose (ADPG) and UDPG levels in SQD2.2-OE plants were notably lower than those in WT plants.

Here we show that GAPC interacts with a transcription factor to promote the expression of heat-inducible genes and heat tolerance in Arabidopsis. GAPC accumulates in the nucleus under heat stress. Overexpression of GAPC enhances heat tolerance of seedlings and the expression of heat-inducible genes whereas knockout of GAPCs has opposite effects. Screening of Arabidopsis transcription factors identifies nuclear factor Y subunit C10 (NF-YC10) as a GAPC-binding protein. The effects of GAPC overexpression are abolished when NF-YC10 is deficient, the heat-induced nuclear accumulation of GAPC is suppressed, or the GAPC-NF-YC10 interaction is disrupted. GAPC overexpression also enhances the binding ability of NF-YC10 to its target promoter. The results reveal a cellular and molecular mechanism for the nuclear moonlighting of a glycolytic enzyme in plant response to environmental changes.",Sang- C Kim; Xuemin Wang; Liang Guo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this work, by measuring lipid levels with mass spectrometry, we confirm the previously observed changes in  leaf lipids under three heat stress regimens. Additionally, in response to heat, increased oxidation of the fatty acyl chains of leaf galactolipids, sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerols, and phosphatidylglycerols, and incorporation of oxidized acyl chains into acylated monogalactosyldiacylglycerols are shown. We also observed increased levels of digalactosylmonoacylglycerols and monogalactosylmonoacylglycerols.

The results indicated that Cd stress did not decrease the concentrations of monogalactosyldiacyglycerol (MGDG), phosphatidylcholine (PC), lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and phosphatidic acid at 6 h, but decreased digalactosyldoacylglycerol (DGDG), MGDG, PC, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylserine (PS) and LPC concentrations in wheat root at 24 h. Although the concentrations of highly abundant glycerolipids PC and PE were decreased, the ratios of PC/PE increased thus contributing to wheat adaptation to Cd stress. Cd did not reduce the extent of total lipid unsaturation due to the unchanged concentrations of high abundance species of C36:4, C34:2, C34:3 and C36:6 at 6 h, indicative of their roles in resisting Cd stress. The correlation analysis revealed the glycerolipids species experiencing co-metabolism under Cd stress, which is driven by the activated expression of genes related to glycerolipid metabolism, desaturation and oxylipin synthesis.

Overexpression of NPC6 increased seed oil content, seed weight and oil yield both in Arabidopsis and Camelina, whereas knockout of NPC6 decreased seed oil content and seed size. NPC6 is associated with the chloroplasts and microsomal membranes, and hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine and galactolipids to produce diacylglycerol. Knockout and overexpression of NPC6 decreased and increased, respectively, the flux of fatty acids from phospholipids and galactolipids into triacylglycerol production. Candidate-gene association study in oilseed rape indicates that only BnNPC6.C01 of the four homeologues NPC6s is associated with seed oil content and yield.

Constitutive overexpression of pPLAIIIδ under the control of the constitutive cauliflower mosaic 35S promoter resulted in a significant increase in seed oil content and a decrease in cellulose content. In addition, the content of major membrane phospholipids, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, in 35S::pPLAIIIδ plants was increased. However, these changes in 35S::pPLAIIIδ camelina were associated with shorter cell length, leaves, stems, and seed pods and a decrease in overall seed production. When pPLAIIIδ was expressed under the control of the seed specific, β-conglycinin promoter, the seed oil content was increased without compromising plant growth.

The acylation of NPC4 was detected using NPC4 isolated from Arabidopsis and reconstituted in vitro. The C-terminal Cys-533 was identified as the S-acylation residue and mutation of Cys-533 to Ala-533 of NPC4 (NPC4 ) led to the loss of S-acylation and membrane association of NPC4. Knockout of NPC4 impeded the phosphate deficiency-induced decrease of the phosphosphingolipid glycosyl inositol phosphoryl ceramide (GIPC), but introducing NPC4 to npc4-1 failed to complement this defect, supporting that the non-acylated NPC4 fails to hydrolyze GIPC during phosphate deprivation. Moreover, NPC4 failed to complement the primary root growth in npc4-1 under stress. In addition, NPC4 in Brassica napus was S-acylated and mutation of the S-acylating cysteine residue of BnaC01.NPC4 led to the loss of S-acylation and its membrane association.

Acclimation of plants to non-freezing cold before exposure to freezing temperatures improves the outcome of plants, compared to plants exposed to freezing without acclimation.  plants were subjected to one of three treatments: (1) ""control"", i.e., growth at 21 °C, (2) ""non-acclimated"", i.e., 3 days at 21 °C, 2 h at -8 °C, and 24 h recovery at 21 °C, and (3) ""acclimated"", i.e., 3 days at 4 °C, 2 h at -8 °C, and 24 h recovery at 21 °C. Plants were harvested at seven time points during the treatments, and lipid levels were measured by direct-infusion electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Ion leakage was measured at the same time points. To examine the function of lipid species in relation to freezing tolerance, the lipid levels in plants immediately following the freezing treatment were correlated with the outcome, i.e., ion leakage 24-h post-freezing. Based on the correlations, hypotheses about the functions of specific lipids were generated. Additionally, analysis of the lipid levels in plants with mutations in genes encoding patatin-like phospholipases, lipoxygenases, and 12-oxophytodienoic acid reductase 3 (), under the same treatments as the wild-type plants, identified only the  mutant as having major lipid compositional differences compared to wild-type plants.",Ch A Roach; Xuemin Wang; Neema Prakash; Hollie Porras; Jyoti Shah; Gary Gadbury; Kaleb Lowe; Samuel Honey; Pamela Tamura; Haiyan Wang; Ruth Welti; Ma R Roth; Sujon Sarowar; Maoyin Li; Thilani Samarakoon; Sunitha Shiva; Hieu S Vu; Morgan Stuke,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Under nitrogen deficiency, -OE soybean plants had a higher chlorophyll content and activity of nitrogen assimilation-related enzymes than wild-type soybean plants. -OE led to a higher level of specific PA species in roots after rhizobium inoculation than wild type. -OE soybean plants also increased seed production under nitrogen deprivation with and without nodulation and decreased seed germination in response to high humidity storage and artificial aging.

We previously reported that in response to heat stress, GAPC accumulated in the nucleus to modulate transcription and thermotolerance. Here we show a cellular and molecular mechanism that mediates heat-induced nuclear translocation of cytosolic GAPC in Arabidopsis thaliana. Heat-induced GAPC nuclear accumulation and plant heat tolerance were reduced in Arabidopsis phospholipase D (PLD) knockout mutants of pldδ and pldα1pldδ, but not of pldα1. These changes were restored to wild type by genetic complementation with active PLDδ, but not with catalytically inactive PLDδ. GAPC overexpression enhanced the seedling thermotolerance and the expression of heat-inducible genes, but this effect was abolished in the pldδ background. Heat stress elevated the levels of the PLD product phosphatidic acid (PA) in the nucleus in wild type, but not in pldδ plants. Lipid labeling demonstrated the heat-induced nuclear co-localization of PA and GAPC, which was impaired by zinc, which inhibited the PA-GAPC interaction, and by the membrane trafficking inhibitor brefeldin A (BFA). The GAPC nuclear accumulation and seedling thermotolerance were also decreased by treatment with zinc or BFA. Our data suggest that PLDδ and PA are critical for the heat-induced nuclear translocation of GAPC. We propose that PLDδ-produced PA mediates the process via lipid-protein interaction and that the lipid mediation acts as a cellular conduit linking stress perturbations at cell membranes to nuclear functions in plants coping with heat stress.",Sang- C Kim; Shuaibing Yao; Qun Zhang; Xuemin Wang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To realize the potential for sustainable production of camelina, a better understanding of how camelina seed oil production and composition respond to low input environments is desired. Phosphorus (P) is one of the least available essential macronutrients to plants with finite worldwide supply. This study investigated seed oil production and lipid composition of camelina in field settings and under greenhouse conditions in response to P deficiency. Lipidomic profiling reveals that P deficiency in field settings triggered extensive leaf lipid remodeling that decreased the ratio of phospholipids to non-P-containing galactolipids from 30% to 5% under P sufficient to deficient conditions. P deficiency increased seed oil content per seed weight by approximately 25% and 20% in field and greenhouse settings, respectively. In addition, P deficiency altered seed fatty acid composition, with increases in monounsaturated 18:1 and 20:1 and decreases in polyunsaturated 18:3. Total seed production was decreased by 10- to 15-fold under P deficiency and the decrease resulted from reduced seed numbers without affecting seed weight. The results from field and greenhouse conditions indicate that P deficiency increases seed oil content, alters fatty acid composition, and decreases greatly seed production, suggesting that achieving a high yield and quality of camelina seed oil is positively linked to P status of soil.",Ch A Shapiro; Xuemin Wang; Jianwu Li; Daniel P Schachtman; Yuan Su,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about these membrane-cytoskeleton interfaces and related genes. Here, we report the roles of a major root phospholipase D (PLD), PLDα1, and its enzymatic product, phosphatidic acid (PA), in rhizobium-root interaction and nodulation. PLDα1 was activated and the PA content transiently increased in roots after rhizobial infection. Levels of PLDα1 transcript and PA, as well as actin and tubulin cytoskeleton-related gene expression, changed markedly during root-rhizobium interactions and nodule development. Pre-treatment of the roots of soybean seedlings with n-butanol suppressed the generation of PLD-derived PA, the expression of early nodulation genes and nodule numbers. Overexpression or knockdown of GmPLDα1 resulted in changes in PA levels, glycerolipid profiles, nodule numbers, actin cytoskeleton dynamics, early nodulation gene expression and hormone levels upon rhizobial infection compared with GUS roots. The transcript levels of cytoskeleton-related genes, such as GmACTIN, GmTUBULIN, actin capping protein 1 (GmCP1) and microtubule-associating protein (GmMAP1), were modified in GmPLDα1-altered hairy roots compared with those of GUS roots. Phosphatidic acid physically bound to GmCP1 and GmMAP1, which could be related to cytoskeletal changes in rhizobium-infected GmPLDα1 mutant roots.

Two independent OsDGK1-knockout (dgk1) lines exhibited a higher density of lateral roots (LR) and thinner seminal roots (SR), whereas OsDGK1-overexpressing plants displayed a lower LR density and thicker SR than wild-type (WT) plants. Overexpression of OsDGK1 led to a decline in the DGK substrate DAG whereas specific PA species decreased in dgk1 roots. Supplementation of DAG to OsDGK1-overexpressing seedlings restored the LR density and SR thickness whereas application of PA to dgk1 seedlings restored the LR density and SR thickness to those of WT. In addition, treatments of rice seedling with the DGK inhibitor R59022 increased the level of DAG and decreased PA, which also restored the root phenotype of OsDGK1-overexpressing seedlings close to that of WT.

The investigated lipidomic and carbohydrate profiles with the transcriptome of developing nodules revealed highly activated glycolysis, fatty acid (FA), 2-monoacylglycerol (2-MAG), and membrane lipid biosynthesis and transport during nodule development. RNA-Seq profiling of metabolic genes in roots and developing nodules highlighted the enhanced expression of genes involved in biosynthesis and transport of FAs, membrane lipids, and 2-MAG in rhizobia-soybean symbioses via the RAML-WRI-FatM-GPAT-STRL pathway, which is similar to that in legume-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi symbiosis. The essential roles of the metabolic pathway during soybean nodulation were further supported by analysis of transgenic hairy roots overexpressing soybean GmWRI1b-OE and GmLEC2a-OE. GmLEC2a-OE hairy roots produced fewer nodules, in contrast to GmWRI1b-OE hairy roots. GmLEC2a-OE hairy roots displayed different or even opposite expression patterns of the genes involved in glycolysis and the synthesis of FAs, 2-MAG, TAG, and membrane lipids compared to GmWRI1b-OE hairy roots. Glycolysis, FA and membrane lipid biosynthesis were repressed in GmLEC2a-OE but increased in GmWRI1b-OE hairy roots, which may account for the reduced nodulation in GmLEC2a-OE hairy roots but increased nodulation in GmWRI1b-OE hairy roots.

Detailed genetic analyses of pldδ with mutations in genes for salicylic acid (SA) synthesis (SID2) and/or signaling (EDS1 and PAD4), measurement of SA and jasmonic acid (JA) levels, and expression of their respective reporter genes indicate that PLDδ contributes to basal resistance independent of EDS1/PAD4, SA, and JAsignaling.

In vitro analysis revealed that PLDδ bound to microtubules, resulting in microtubule disorganization. Site-specific mutations that decreased PLDδ enzymatic activity impaired its effects on destabilizing microtubule organization. Heat shock transiently activated PLDδ, without any change of its PM localization, triggering microtubule dissociation from PM and depolymerization and seedling death in Arabidopsis, but these effects were alleviated in pldδ knockout mutants. Complementation of pldδ with wild-type PLDδ, but not mutated PLDδ, restored the phenotypes of microtubules and seedling survival to those of wild-type Arabidopsis. Thus, we conclude that the PM-associated PLDδ negatively regulates plant thermotolerance via destabilizing cortical microtubules, in an activity-dependent manner, rather than its subcellular translocation.",Peipei Wang; Ping Song; Liang Guo; Chuanpeng Zhang; Tonglin Mao; Ming Yuan; Xuemin Wang; Yana Qu; Wenhua Zhang; Qianru Jia; Qun Zhang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

African American women have disparate rates of trauma exposure and subsequent PTSD that is often considered in relation to their religion, spirituality, and the availability of social support. The present study adds to the existing literature by examining various religious behaviors and social support among 101 African American women who were distinguished based on the problem generating nature of their traumatic event. Almost all of the women experienced an event (91%), of which a majority of the events qualified as traumatic (61%), and a quarter of the women who experienced an event (27%) experienced the additive influence of PTSD. A majority of the women reported frequent religious behaviors such as daily prayer (80%) and taking religious advice or teaching into consideration (67%). Most also reported the availability of social support. There was a higher probability of being in the additive PTSD group if women had ever married and reported poorer health.

Background: Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) has been shown to be effective in treating opioid use disorder (OUD) among both older adults and veterans of United States Armed Forces. However, limited evidence exists on MAT’s differential effect on treatment completion across age groups. This study aims to ascertain the role of MAT and age on treatment completion for OUD for veterans seeking treatment in non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care facilities. 
Methods: We used the TEDS-D (2006-2017) to examine trends in treatment and MAT usage over time and TEDS-2017 to determine the role of age and MAT on treatment completion. We examined a subset of those who self-identified as veterans and who sought treatment for an OUD.
Results: Veterans presented in treatment more often as heroin users than prescription opioid users, and older veterans were more likely to get MAT than younger veterans. We found that before propensity score matching (PSM), MAT initially appeared to be associated with a lower likelihood of treatment completion in inpatient (β=-1.47, 95% CI -1.56, -1.39) and outpatient (β=-1.40, 95% CI -2.21, -0.58) settings, and age (50+) appeared to mediate the effect of MAT on treatment completion (β=-0.54, 95% CI -0.87, -0.21). After matching, older veterans were more likely to complete SUD treatment (β=0.21, 95% CI .01, .42) while age no longer mediated the effect of MAT, and MAT had a significant positive impact on treatment completion in detox settings (β=1.36, 95% CI 1.15, 1.50) and inpatient settings (β=1.54, 95% CI 1.37, 1.71).
Conclusion:  Results show that age plays an important role in outpatient treatment completion, while MAT plays an important role in inpatient treatment completions.  Implications for veterans are discussed.

ABSTRACT
The number of African American women providing unpaid care to an older person is increasing. Multiple stresses are associated with the caregiving experience. This article examines the relationship of both public and private religiosity to the use of alcohol to cope with these stresses. Data were from the Black Rural and Urban Caregivers Mental Health and Functioning Study. This cross-sectional study included 521 midwestern urban (n = 256) and rural (n = 265) African American women who were caregivers of dependent African Americans age 65 years and older. Results of heiarchical multinomial logistic regression revealed that those who are younger, those living in an urban area, and those with lower levels of religious attendance were more likely to use alcohol to cope with the stresses of caregiving. Helping professionals can use a strengths perspective, which highlights the importance of emphasizing strengths to increase caregivers’ personal power, the development of strong coping skills, and the improvement of social support systems to create a positive approach to self-care with a focus on community building.

ABSTRACT
Objective: This study seeks to determine the relationship between referral type (legally mandated versus non-mandated) and substance use disorder (SUD) treatment completion among older adults and by primary substance used.
Method: We used data from the Treatment Episode Data Set - Discharges (TEDS-D) from 2011. Using data for persons age 55 and over (n = 104,747), we used propensity score matching (PSM) to address selection bias and attenuate the likelihood of a type I error. Logistic regression models estimated the effect of referral type on treatment completion based on treatment for a primary substance for five categories of substances.
Results: In the matched sample, those who faced treatment mandates had 71% greater odds of completing treatment compared with those who entered treatment voluntarily (OR =1.71, 95% CI [1.64, 1.79]). Based on the primary drug used, odds of treatment completion were highest for alcohol, with 86% greater treatment completion for the mandated individuals compared with those entering treatment without a legal mandate (OR =1.86, 95% CI [1.75, 1.97]).
Conclusion: These findings suggest that the motivating influence of treatment mandates may encourage completion of SUD treatment among older adults. Although the legal mandates for treatment are punitive, they may act to keep older adults with SUD engaged in treatment, an important factor as treatment completion is inversely related to relapse of a SUD.

Abstract
This study examines factors associated with the amount of time African American and European American clergy spend counseling older adults for emotional problems. We used a cross sectional survey design with data gathered through the use of a brief, two page, mailed survey, the implementation of which was rooted in Dillman’s Tailored Design Method. The study is based in a mental health literacy framework. This study was completed in a Midwestern metropolitan area with African American and European American, Christian clergy. We used ordinary least squares regression analysis to compare variables’ relationships with the amount of time that clergy spent counseling older people. Findings indicate that clergy who are African American, clergy who have more training specific to mental illness, and clergy who are Roman Catholic spend greater percentages of their time counseling older people. Discussion centers on an explanation of results and how best to support clergy in their role as front line providers of supportive counseling services.

Background:
There is a large body of research indicating that substance use disorder treatment completion leads to higher rates of sustained recovery. However, not much is known about how age and opioid treatment programs (OTPs) interact to affect treatment completion. The purpose of this article is to better understand the pathway between age, OTP, and treatment completion.
Methods:
Data from the US 2017 Treatment Episodes Data Set was analyzed. Seemingly unrelated bivariate probit regression was used to determine whether OTP access mediates the relationship between age and treatment completion. We used propensity score matching to simulate the effects of a randomized control trial and to attenuate the likelihood of a Type 1 error.
Results:
Older adults have a higher likelihood than their younger counterparts of completing treatment regardless of OTP status in inpatient and outpatient settings. Those who received OTP in inpatient treatment had a 45% increased probability of completing treatment in detox settings and a 41% increased probability of completing treatment in inpatient settings. Older adults (age 50+) were more likely to receive OTP than their younger counterparts. There is a small but significant indirect effect of age on treatment completion in inpatient settings.
Conclusions:
Older adults are more likely to receive OTP in both inpatient and outpatient settings. However, age does not appear to affect the probability of treatment completion when individuals receive OTP, except in inpatient settings. Implications are discussed.

Purpose.  The purpose of this study is to investigate whether older adults who are more impulsive also tend to engage in more health behaviors associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD).
Methods.  We analyzed data from the Health and Retirement Study. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the likelihood of medication adherence, alcohol consumption and exercise among hypertensive older adults.  Results.  Adjusted regression results revealed higher impulsive decision making was associated with greater likelihood of obesity (OR=2.96, 95%CI 1.00, 8.92), and a lower likelihood of medication adherence (OR=0.37, 95%CI 0.15, 0.92) and regular drinking (OR=0.36, 95%CI 0.15, 0.87). Higher impulsive decision making was associated with lower likelihood of regular exercise only in unadjusted models. 
Conclusions.    Hypertensive older individuals who had higher impulsive decision making engaged in health behaviors which would increase their risk for CVD.  Healthcare providers should consider the range of strategies offered through behavioral economics to improve health in these at-risk populations.

EDock-ML takes a bottom-up approach in which machine-learning models are developed one protein at a time to improve predictions for the proteins included in its database. Because the machine-learning models are intended to be used without changing the docking and model parameters with which the models were trained, novice users can use it directly without worrying about what parameters to choose. A user simply submits a compound specified by an ID from the ZINC database (Sterling, T.; Irwin, J.

Since many approved drugs have nonequilibrium binding characteristics, there has been increasing interest in optimizing binding kinetics early in the drug discovery process. As focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is an important drug target, we examine whether steered molecular dynamics (SMD) can be useful for identifying drug candidates with the desired drug-binding kinetics. In simulating the dissociation of 14 ligands from FAK, we find an empirical power-law relationship between the simulated time needed for ligand unbinding and the experimental rate constant for dissociation, with a strong correlation depending on the SMD force used. To improve predictions, we further develop regression models connecting experimental dissociation rate with various structural and energetic quantities derived from the simulations.

This shortcoming has led to the decrease, rather than an increase in the performance of classifying compounds when more structures are added to the ensemble. Previously, we suggested machine-learning, implemented in the form of a naïve Bayesian model could alleviate this problem. However, the naïve Bayesian model assumed that the probabilities of observing the docking scores to different structures to be independent.

Design: The research design was correlational. Following preliminary item creation and expert review, survey based studies were conducted to develop theoretically-based, psychometrically sound scales measuring contesting orientations. Method: In Study 1, an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was performed on a preliminary 39-item COS administered to a sample of high school athletes (N = 233). Study 2 used EFA to evaluate a revised 23-item COS with a second sample of high school athletes (N = 92) resulting in a final reduction of the measure to twelve items. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was then conducted on this 12-item COS, which proved an excellent fit to the data. A new sample of college athletes (N = 238) allowed Study 3 to (a) further examine the factorial validity of the COS, including gender invariance testing, (b) assess the concurrent validity of the COS via its correlations with goal orientations, empathy, moral identity, and moral disengagement; and, (c) assess the COS's incremental predictive utility for investigations of sportspersonship. Results and conclusion: Results from the sequence of studies demonstrate that the 12-item, two-scale COS has good psychometric properties as assessed through EFA and CFA, good concurrent validity, and adds significantly to existing measures in the prediction of sportspersonship.

This is the setting for The Mask of Zorro. One of many revisions of Mark of Zorro (1920, one of the first United Artists films), Mask foregrounds the intergenerational dynamics underlying the Zorro theme of rivalry between nobleman-turned-bandit and corrupt officials. The main protagonists in this rivalry are: the elder Zorro, landed gentleman Diego de la Vega, who avenges his own twenty-year imprisonment, shooting of wife Esperanza, and kidnapping of daughter Elena; don Rafael Montero, former Spanish governor, who carried out these acts, now aided by young U.S. southern mercenary, Captain Harrison Love; and Alejandro Murrieta, young orphaned thief of ambiguous ethnic parentage, whom Diego transforms into a gentleman-avenger to inherit the role of Zorro. This is a tale of aspirational nobility, dynastic power. Such aspirations set in California-between-empires fantastically epitomize the ideological space of the neoliberal 1990s: a cradle for a patronizing elite caste unfettered by state oversight.[1] 

To see this filmic neoliberal space in Mask, we recall Michel Foucault’s “heterotopias” –actual spaces that exist apart from, but always in relation to, the “real space of Society.” To illustrate: the horse stable (above) is a special kind of space within the class demarcations of the great-estate–unlike, say, a chicken coop or milk barn—wherein refined equestrian skills permit both an elite woman and a lower-class man to interact, triangulated via sensuous animals, in ways not sanctioned in other estate spaces, say, the dining hall. This is further illustrated in another stable scene wherein Elena (unknowingly) meets her long-lost father (Diego) posing as a servant. Moreover, while scholars have argued that film is intrinsically heterotopic; this particular film evokes quintessential Hollywood tropes to constitute California itself as a heterotopia, epitomizing late 20th century neoliberalism.[2]

Mask’s visually-resplendent heterotopia presents something of a puzzle with respect to Jacques Ranciere’s assertion that representational politics impact possibilities for democratic spaces, namely, a plentitude of forms that correlates with plurality: what, then, are the representational practices of the unraveling of democratic formations under the guise of noblesse oblige? Historicizing its 1990s lens, we see Mask’s explicit counterrevolutionary politics.",LJ Frazier (Role:Author); Deborah Cohen (Role:Author),,,Blind Peer Reviewed,International,,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Lead / Corresponding author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

A growing number of studies have indicated that the turnover of phosphatidylcholine plays an important role in the synthesis and modification of triacylglycerols. This study manipulated the expression of a patatin-related phospholipase AIII (pPLAIII) in camelina to determine its effect on seed oil content and plant growth. Constitutive overexpression of pPLAIII under the control of the constitutive cauliflower mosaic 35S promoter resulted in a significant increase in seed oil content and a decrease in cellulose content. In addition, the content of major membrane phospholipids, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, in 35S::pPLAIII plants was increased. However, these changes in 35S::pPLAIII camelina were associated with shorter cell length, leaves, stems, and seed pods and a decrease in overall seed production. When pPLAIII was expressed under the control of the seed specific, -conglycinin promoter, the seed oil content was increased without compromising plant growth. The results suggest that pPLAIII alters the carbon partitioning by decreasing cellulose content and increasing oil content in camelina.

The goal was to distinguish the seeds from each colored fruit and determine their spectra for the first time. The seeds of each variety contained primarily glycosidic carbons, due to their cellulose and hemicellulose content. They also contained carbons due to C=O, C=C, as well as aliphatic carbons. The insoluble fiber found in acai pulp is distinguishable from the seed of the fruit by its unique solid state H-1-decoupled C-13 CPMAS NMR spectra. The seed also contains fats (0.22-0.33%) not previously reported. The seed contains a mixture of saturated and unsaturated fats. There are also 3.38-4.70% total methanolic extractables, with no detectable cyanidin 3-O-glucoside or cyanidin 3-O-rutinoside, unlike the pulp which contains both cyanidins. When the NMR spectra of the white and purple acai seeds are compared, it was possible to observe differences between these two acai varieties, as well as differences between the composition of pulp of the fruit and its seed.

Cell viability was measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, and cell death was determined by lactate dehydrogenase levels. Three supplements strongly decreased the cell viability at extract concentrations of 1 µg/mL, of which 1 decreased cell viability at 0.1 µg/µL. Also, strong neuronal toxicities of these supplements were found. Cell death was observed at concentrations of 10 µg/mL. The degree of toxicity was comparable to the ones found in Annonaceous fruit extracts. Two fruit pulps of Annonaceae (A. muricata and A. squamosa) showed a reduction in cell viability at lower concentrations. The fruit pulp extract of A. muricata revealed the strongest neurotoxic effect, with 67% cell death at a concentration of 1 µg/mL. A high reduction in cell viability coupled with pronounced cell death was found at 0.1 µg/mL for an Annonaceous seed extract.

Our recent studies with immortalized murine microglial cells (BV-2) demonstrated effects of botanical polyphenols to inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nitric oxide (NO) and enhance Nrf2-mediated antioxidant responses (Sun et al., 2015). In this study, an immortalized rat astrocyte (DI TNC1) cell line expressing a luciferase reporter driven by the NF-κB or the Nrf2/Antioxidant Response Element (ARE) promoter was used to assess regulation of these two pathways by phytochemicals such as quercetin, rutin, cyanidin, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, as well as botanical extracts from Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha), Sutherlandia frutescens (Sutherlandia) and Euterpe oleracea (Açaí). Quercetin effectively inhibited LPS-induced NF-κB reporter activity and stimulated Nrf2/ARE reporter activity in DI TNC1 astrocytes. Cyanidin and the glycosides showed similar effects but only at much higher concentrations. All three botanical extracts effectively inhibited LPS-induced NF-κB reporter activity. These extracts were capable of enhancing ARE activity by themselves and further enhanced ARE activity in the presence of LPS. Quercetin and botanical extracts induced Nrf2 and HO-1 protein expression. Interestingly, Ashwagandha extract was more active in inducing Nrf2 and HO-1 expression in DI TNC1 astrocytes as compared to Sutherlandia and Açaí extracts. In summary, this study demonstrated NF-kB and Nrf2/ARE promoter activities in DI TNC1 astrocytes, and further showed differences in ability for specific botanical polyphenols and extracts to down-regulate LPS-induced NF-kB and up-regulate the NRF2/ARE activities in these cells.",Thomas K Dobbs; Dennis B Lubahn; Zezong Gu; Grace Y Sun; Rob E Smith; Valeri V V Mossine; Kevin L Fritsche; Mark Hannink; Zihong Chen; Runting Li; Agnes Simonyi; Deepa Ajit; G A Weisman; William R Folk; Rensheng Luo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bethany,Zolman,Metabolic alterations in the enoyl-CoA hydratase 2 mutant disrupt peroxisomal pathways in seedlings,Plant Physiology,8/1/2019,2019.0,180,1860-1876,4,http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/180/4/1860.long,Completed/Published,10.1104/pp.19.00300,31138624,PMC6670076,,Summer,2019,"Mobilization of seed storage compounds, such as starch and oil, is required to provide energy and metabolic building blocks during seedling development. Over 50% of fatty acids in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seed oil have a cis-double bond on an even-numbered carbon. Degradation of these substrates requires peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidation plus additional enzyme activities. Such auxiliary enzymes, including the enoyl-CoA hydratase ECH2, convert (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA intermediates to the core β-oxidation substrate (S)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA. ECH2 was suggested to function in the peroxisomal conversion of indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) to indole-3-acetic acid, because ech2 seedlings have altered IBA responses. The underlying mechanism connecting ECH2 activity and IBA metabolism is unclear. Here, we show that ech2 seedlings have reduced root length, smaller cotyledons, and arrested pavement cell expansion. At the cellular level, reduced oil body mobilization and enlarged peroxisomes suggest compromised β-oxidation. ech2 seedlings accumulate 3-hydroxyoctenoate (C8:1-OH) and 3-hydroxyoctanoate (C8:0-OH), putative hydrolysis products of catabolic intermediates for α-linolenic acid and linoleic acid, respectively. Wild-type seedlings treated with 3-hydroxyoctanoate have ech2-like growth defects and altered IBA responses. ech2 phenotypes are not rescued by Suc or auxin application. However, ech2 phenotypes are suppressed in combination with the core β-oxidation mutants mfp2 or ped1, and ech2 mfp2 seedlings accumulate less C8:1-OH and C8:0-OH than ech2 seedlings. These results indicate that ech2 phenotypes require efficient core β-oxidation. Our findings suggest that low ECH2 activity causes metabolic alterations through a toxic effect of the accumulating intermediates. These effects manifest in altered lipid metabolism and IBA responses leading to disrupted seedling development.",Bethany Karlin Zolman (Role:Author); Ying Li (Role:Author); Yu Liu (Role:Author),,,"Non-blind, Peer Reviewed",International,Research Board,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Lead / Corresponding author,NIH,,,,English,,Self-reported,

IBA is metabolized into free IAA in peroxisomes in a multistep process similar to fatty acid β-oxidation. We identified LONG CHAIN ACYL-COA SYNTHETASE 4 (LACS4) in a screen for enhanced IBA resistance in primary root elongation in Arabidopsis thaliana. LACSs activate substrates by catalyzing the addition of CoA, the necessary first step for fatty acids to participate in β-oxidation or other metabolic pathways. Here, we describe the novel role of LACS4 in hormone metabolism and postulate that LACS4 catalyzes the addition of CoA onto IBA, the first step in its β-oxidation. lacs4 is resistant to the effects of IBA in primary root elongation and dark-grown hypocotyl elongation, and has reduced lateral root density. lacs6 also is resistant to IBA, although both lacs4 and lacs6 remain sensitive to IAA in primary root elongation, demonstrating that auxin responses are intact. LACS4 has in vitro enzymatic activity on IBA, but not IAA or IAA conjugates, and disruption of LACS4 activity reduces the amount of IBA-derived IAA in planta. We conclude that, in addition to activity on fatty acids, LACS4 and LACS6 also catalyze the addition of CoA onto IBA, the first step in IBA metabolism and a necessary step in generating IBA-derived IAA.",Bethany K Zolman; Vanessica Jawahir,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,International,Research Board,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Lead / Corresponding author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Erika,Gibb,First Comet Observations with NIRSPEC-2 at Keck: Outgassing Sources of Parent Volatiles and Abundances Based on Alternative Taxonomic Compositional Baselines in 46P/Wirtanen,Planetary Science Journal,4/1/2021,2021.0,2,45-62,,,Completed/Published,10.3847/PSJ/abd03c,,,,Spring,2021,"A major upgrade to the NIRSPEC instrument at the Keck II telescope was successfully completed in time for near infrared spectroscopic observations of comet 46P/Wirtanen during its exceptionally close flyby of Earth in 2018
December. These studies determined the abundances of several volatiles, including C2H2, C2H6, CH3OH, NH3, HCN, H2CO, and H2O. Long-slit spatial distributions of gas rotational temperature and column density are diagnostic for the presence of icy grains in the coma and understanding if different volatiles are associated with common or distinct outgassing sources. These spatial distributions suggest that C2H2, C2H6, and HCN have a common outgassing source, whereas H2O and CH3OH have additional, more extended sources. The synergy of these findings with observations by space missions (Rosetta and EPOXI) motivates continuing studies to address whether or not C2H6, C2H2, and HCN have a common source of release (plausibly associated with CO2) in a larger sample of comets and whether systematic differences exist in the release of these species compared to H2O and CH3OH. Abundances of volatiles are reported relative to H2O, as traditionally done, as well as C2H6. While not unique, the choice of C2H6 demonstrates the value of
extending the chemical taxonomy of parent volatiles in comets toward additional compositional “baselines” and, importantly, closer integration between coma abundances and the underlying volatile associations as revealed by spatial distributions. Our findings on composition and sources of outgassing include information relevant to future evaluations of 46P/Wirtanen as a prospective spacecraft target.",Dennis Bodewits (Role:Author); Adam J McKay (Role:Author); Jacques Crovisier (Role:Author); Nicolas Biver (Role:Author); Anita L Cochran (Role:Author); Nathan X Roth (Role:Author); Geronimo L Villanueva (Role:Author); Kumar Venkataramani (Role:Author); Michael R Combi (Role:Author); Yinsi Shou (Role:Author); Martin A Cordiner (Role:Author); Gregory Doppmann (Role:Author); Hideyo Kawakita (Role:Author); Neil Dello Russo (Role:Author); Michael A DiSanti (Role:Author); Mohammad Saki (Role:Graduate Student Researcher); Erika L Gibb (Role:Author); Emily C Martin (Role:Author); Ronald J Vervack (Role:Author); Boncho P Bonev (Role:Author); Younas Khan (Role:Graduate Student Researcher),,,Blind Peer Reviewed,International,Research Board,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Co-author,NSF,,,,English,,Self-reported,

The current study utilizes a large-scale, multi-site, prospective study of trauma survivors presenting to emergency departments. Hypotheses tested whether elevated anxiety sensitivity in the immediate posttrauma period is associated with more severe and persistent trajectories of common adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae in the eight weeks posttrauma. Participants from the AURORA study (n = 2,269 recruited from 23 emergency departments) completed self-report assessments over eight weeks posttrauma. Associations between heightened anxiety sensitivity and more severe and/or persistent trajectories of trauma-related symptoms identified by growth mixture modeling were analyzed. Anxiety sensitivity assessed two weeks posttrauma was associated with severe and/or persistent posttraumatic stress, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, pain, and somatic symptoms in the eight weeks posttrauma. Effect sizes were in the small to medium range in multivariate models accounting for various demographic, trauma-related, pre-trauma mental health-related, and personality-related factors. Anxiety sensitivity may be a useful transdiagnostic risk factor in the immediate posttraumatic period identifying individuals at risk for the development of adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae. Further, considering anxiety sensitivity is malleable via brief intervention, it could be a useful secondary prevention target.

Steven,Bruce,(R) Influence of anhedonic symptom severity on reward circuit connectivity in PTSD,Behavioural Brain Research,6/11/2021,2021.0,407,113258,,,Completed/Published,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2021.113258,33775774, PMC8489735,,Spring,2021,"Background: Anhedonia, marked by deficits in the consummatory and anticipatory reward processing phases, is a prominent symptom of several psychiatric conditions and has been shown to influence functional connectivity between reward-related regions. However, the unique influence of anhedonia severity on reward circuit connectivity in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) remains unclear. To address this, we examined resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the ventral striatum as a function of anhedonia for individuals with PTSD. 

Methods: Resting-state functional MRI scans and behavioral assessments were collected for 71 women diagnosed with PTSD. Seed-based voxelwise rsFC analyses for left and right nucleus accumbens (NAcc) seed regions of interest were performed. Voxelwise regression analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between anhedonia severity and rsFC of left and right NAcc. 

Results: Results indicated that greater anhedonia severity was associated with reduced rsFC between the left NAcc and a cluster in the left caudate extending to the thalamus. This relationship between anhedonia and rsFC remained significant after controlling for PTSD symptom severity or depression severity. 

Conclusions: Our findings suggest that reward circuit dysfunction at rest is associated with anhedonia in PTSD. These results further contribute to our understanding of the neural correlates of consummatory anhedonia in psychiatric conditions.

Yet to our knowledge, few studies have examined self-referential cognition by analyzing survivors’ written impact statements in individuals whose PTSD is due to interpersonal trauma. In the current study, we performed a linguistic analysis of impact statements (i.e., descriptions of how the trauma has affected the survivors’ views of themselves, others, and the world) collected at the beginning of therapy from women with PTSD that was due to interpersonal trauma, with the goal of determining whether PTSD symptom clusters were associated with altered self-referential thought. We found that a higher level of PTSD-related hyperarousal symptoms were significantly associated with diminished self-related word use after controlling for depression severity, f2 = .31. Similarly, diminished negative self-related word use was also associated with a higher level of hyperarousal symptoms, f2 = .47. Our findings align with previous research that has provided evidence for a diminished sense of self in PTSD. These results may help inform targeted interventions aimed at improving social-affective functions in PTSD and other psychiatric conditions.

Neuroimaging research has implicated cortical midline brain structures, including the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and isthmus cingulate (IsthCing), in rumination in healthy and depressed populations. While past research has revealed dysfunction in cortical midline regions in PTSD, no studies have yet investigated the structural and functional neural mechanisms underlying rumination in women with PTSD. In the current study, we used structural MRI and resting-state fMRI to examine relationships between rumination and brain volume, as well as resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of cortical midline structures in women with PTSD due to interpersonal trauma (N = 71). We performed multiple linear regression analyses to relate brain volume in rACC, PCC, and IsthCing regions to self-reported rumination, after controlling for age and total intracranial volume. We also conducted standard seed-based voxelwise rsFC analyses for significant regions identified in the structural analysis. We found a significant relationship between greater rumination and volume in the left IsthCing (p = .025). Results from the rsFC analyses revealed a significant relationship between greater rumination and diminished rsFC between the left IsthCing and left precuneus (pFWE < .05). These findings provide novel support for alterations in the neural substrates of ruminative thought in women with PTSD. More broadly, we discuss clinical implications for targeted interventions to reduce rumination through psychotherapy or non-invasive brain stimulation.

In a sample of individuals recently exposed to trauma (N=116, 76 Female), we found that PTSD symptoms at 2-weeks were associated with decreased hippocampal responses to threat as assessed with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Further, the relationship between hippocampal threat sensitivity and PTSD symptomology only emerged in individuals who showed transient, high threat-related arousal, as assayed by an independently collected measure of Fear Potentiated Startle. Collectively, our finding suggests that development of PTSD is associated with threat-related decreases in hippocampal function, due to increases in fear-potentiated arousal.Alterations in hippocampal function linked to threat-related arousal are reliably associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); however, how these alterations relate to the sequelae of trauma-related symptoms is unknown. Prior models based on non-trauma samples suggest that arousal may impact hippocampal neurophysiology leading to maladaptive behavior. Here we show that decreased hippocampal threat sensitivity interacts with fear-potentiated startle to predict PTSD symptoms. Specifically, individuals with high fear-potentiated startle and low, transient hippocampal threat sensitivity showed the greatest PTSD symptomology.

APNS across all ten symptom domains were common in the first two months after trauma. Many risk factors and associations with high symptom burden trajectories were shared across domains. Both across and within traditional diagnostic boundaries, APNS trajectory intercepts, and slopes were substantially correlated. Across all domains, symptom severity in the immediate aftermath of trauma (trajectory intercepts) had the greatest influence on the outcome. An interactive data visualization tool was developed to allow readers to explore relationships of interest between individual characteristics, symptom trajectories, and traditional outcomes ( http://itr.med.unc.edu/aurora/parcoord/ ).

Theory has suggested that in individuals with PTSD, rumination serves as a cognitive avoidance factor that contributes to the maintenance of symptoms by inhibiting the cognitive and emotional processing of the traumatic event, subsequently interfering with treatment engagement and outcome. Little is known about the neural correlates of rumination in women with PTSD. The current study utilized functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine neural correlates during an emotion interference task of self-reported rumination in women with PTSD. Women with PTSD (39 participants) were recruited at a university-based trauma clinic and completed a clinical evaluation that included measures of PTSD symptoms, rumination, and depressive symptoms, as well as a neuroimaging session in which the participants were administered an emotion interference task. There was a significant relationship between self-reported rumination and activity in the right orbital frontal cortex, BA 11; t(37) = 5.62, p = .004, k = 46 during the task.

Limited work to date, however, has investigated potential racial/ethnic variability in amygdala reactivity or connectivity that may in turn be related to outcomes such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Participants from the AURORA study (n = 283), a multisite longitudinal study of trauma outcomes, completed functional magnetic resonance imaging and psychophysiology within approximately two-weeks of trauma exposure. Seed-based amygdala connectivity and amygdala reactivity during passive viewing of fearful and neutral faces were assessed during fMRI. Physiological activity was assessed during Pavlovian threat conditioning. Participants also reported the severity of posttraumatic symptoms 3 and 6 months after trauma. Black individuals showed lower baseline skin conductance levels and startle compared to White individuals, but no differences were observed in physiological reactions to threat. Further, Hispanic and Black participants showed greater amygdala connectivity to regions including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and cerebellum compared to White participants. No differences were observed in amygdala reactivity to threat. Amygdala connectivity was associated with 3-month PTSD symptoms, but the associations differed by racial/ethnic group and were partly driven by group differences in structural inequities.

We documented and analyzed the perspectives of mental health therapists in the context of a randomized control trial (RCT) intervention within the Mekong Project in Cambodia. The research questions explored perceptions of therapists' care of mental health clients, therapist well-being, and experiences of navigating within a research environment in which SGM citizens with mental health concerns receive treatment. The larger study enrolled 150 Cambodian adults, among which 69 identified as SGM. Three key patterns emerged across our interpretations. Clients seek help when symptoms interfere with daily life, therapists care for clients and themselves, and integrated research and practice is integral yet sometimes paradoxical. Therapists did not identify differences in terms of how they work with SGM clients compared with non-SGM clients. Future studies are warranted to examine a reciprocal academic-research partnership in which we examine therapists' work alongside rural community members, evaluate the process of embedding and fortifying peer supports within educational systems, and study the wisdom of traditional and Buddhist healers to address the discrimination and violence that citizens who identify as SGM disproportionately suffer.

This trend is evident in and applicable to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) treatment research given the high nonresponse rate of individuals with PTSD who undergo cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Functional connectivity analyses investigating disrupted brain networks across mental disorders have been employed to understand both mental disorder symptoms and therapeutic mechanisms. However, few studies have examined pre-post CBT brain changes in PTSD using functional connectivity analyses. The current study investigated a) whether brain networks commonly implicated in psychopathology (e.g., default mode network [DMN], central executive network [CEN], and salience network [SN]) changed following Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) for PTSD and b) whether change in these networks was associated with PTSD and/or transdiagnostic symptom change. Independent components analysis was implemented to investigate resting-state functional connectivity in DMN, CEN, and SN in 42 women with PTSD and 18 trauma-exposed controls (TEC). Results indicated weaker CEN-cerebellum connectivity in PTSD participants versus TEC prior to CPT and weaker DMN connectivity in PTSD participants after CPT. Additionally, DMN and SN connectivity was related to change in PTSD symptoms, positive affectivity, negative affectivity, and rumination. These findings provide evidence for normalization of CEN with treatment and implicate the DMN and SN in clinical symptom change following CPT.

However, relationships among volume, extinction learning, and PTSD symptom development remain unclear. We investigated subcortical brain volumes in regions supporting extinction learning and fear-potentiated startle (FPS) to understand brain-behavior interactions that may impact PTSD symptom development in recently traumatized individuals. Participants (N = 99) completed magnetic resonance imaging and threat conditioning two weeks following trauma exposure as part of a multisite observational study to understand the neuropsychiatric effects of trauma (AURORA Study). Participants completed self-assessments of PTSD (PTSD Checklist for DSM-5; PCL-5), dissociation, and depression symptoms two- and eight-weeks post-trauma. We completed multiple regressions to investigate relationships between FPS during late extinction, GMV, and PTSD symptom development. The interaction between thalamic GMV and FPS during late extinction at two weeks post-trauma predicted PCL-5 scores eight weeks (t (75) = 2.49, β = 0.28, p = 0.015) post-trauma. Higher FPS predicted higher PCL-5 scores in the setting of increased thalamic GMV. Meanwhile, lower FPS also predicted higher PCL-5 scores in the setting of decreased thalamic GMV. Thalamic GMV and FPS interactions also predicted posttraumatic dissociative and depressive symptoms. Amygdala and hippocampus GMV by FPS interactions were not associated with posttraumatic symptom development. Taken together, thalamic GMV and FPS during late extinction interact to contribute to adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric outcomes. Multimodal assessments soon after trauma have the potential to distinguish key phenotypes vulnerable to posttraumatic neuropsychiatric outcomes.",Vishnu P Murty; Sanne J H van Rooij; Lauren A M Lebois; Mariam Reda; Alyssa R Roeckner; Antonia V Seligowski; Elizabeth R Steuber; Claire Pearson; Karestan C Koenen; Ronald C Kessler; Nathaniel G Harnett; D A Peak; Kerry J Ressler; S A McLean; Ja M Elliott; L A Hudak; M E McGrath; Robert A Swor; Robert M Domeier; Brittany E Punches; Brian J O'Neil; Niels K Rathlev; Leon D Sanchez; Jennifer S Stevens; Christopher W Jones; Sophia Sheikh; Christopher Lewandowski; Scott L Rauch; Laura T Germine; Sarah D Linnstaedt; Gari D Clifford; Thomas C Neylan; Robert H Pietrzak; Donglin Zeng; Xinming An; Francesca L Beaudoin; Stacey L House; Diego A Pizzagalli; Tanja Jovanovic; Jutta Joormann; Deanna M Barch; Jose L Pascual; Anna M Chang; St E Bruce; Timothy D Ely,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,,,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Neuroimaging studies examining PTSD treatment outcome may offer valuable insights into possible mechanisms that may impact treatment efficacy. To date, few studies of PTSD have used neuroimaging to examine symptom change following completed treatment, and most have focused on gray matter. Studies of white matter are equally important, as changes in white matter integrity (WMI) are connected to a host of detrimental outcomes. The current study examined symptom change of 21 women with PTSD as a result of interpersonal violence who received baseline diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scans and completed 12 weeks of Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT). After controlling for baseline PTSD severity, fractional anisotropy (FA) in the left internal capsule, posterior limb of the internal capsule, left cingulate gyrus, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and splenium of the corpus callosum was predicted by PTSD symptom change. Results contribute to understanding neural changes within therapy and may assist in predicting individual treatment response.

Participants completed a classic Color-Word Stroop task as a measure of inhibitory control and two resting-state fMRI scans. We conducted voxelwise rsFC analyses with seed regions in the DMN, CEN, and SN and voxelwise linear regression analyses to examine the relationship between inhibitory control and rsFC of these networks across the sample. Better Stroop performance was negatively associated with total self-reported PTSD symptoms. An analysis of PTSD symptom clusters indicated that better Stroop performance was also associated with re-experiencing and hyperarousal symptoms, but not avoidance PTSD symptoms. Decreased coupling between the CEN and the DMN was associated with better inhibitory control in this sample of trauma-exposed females. These findings lend support to the hypothesis that efficient switching between these networks may contribute to better performance on cognitive and attentional tasks in trauma-exposed individuals.",Marissa Yetter; St E Bruce; Carissa L Philippi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Participants in this study included 42 women (age = 30.70 age = 9.40) with PTSD from exposure to interpersonal trauma. Demographic characteristics, pre-treatment symptoms of PTSD and depression, and transdiagnostic factors were examined as predictors of attrition and treatment response. Hierarchical regression and logistic regression models were analyzed to test the variance explained and predictive value of these factors. The present study revealed that age was a significant factor related to dropout from CPT-A whereas baseline PTSD symptom severity was significantly related to treatment response. Results of this study suggest the importance of the interrelationships among pre-treatment predictors as well as the consideration of attrition and treatment response as distinct metrics of treatment outcome.

We hypothesized that circadian rhythm changes, measured by a wrist-worn research watch are predictive of post-trauma outcomes. Approach: 1618 post-trauma patients were enrolled after admission to emergency departments (ED). Three standardized questionnaires were administered at week eight to measure post-trauma outcomes related to PTSD, sleep disturbance, and pain interference with daily life. Pulse activity and movement data were captured from a research watch for eight weeks. Standard and novel movement and cardiovascular metrics that reflect circadian rhythms were derived using this data. These features were used to train different classifiers to predict the three outcomes derived from week-eight surveys. Clinical surveys administered at ED were also used as features in the baseline models. Results: The highest cross-validated performance of research watch-based features was achieved for classifying participants with pain interference by a logistic regression model, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.70. The ED survey-based model achieved an AUC of 0.77, and the fusion of research watch and ED survey metrics improved the AUC to 0.79. Significance: This work represents the first attempt to predict and classify post-trauma symptoms from passive wearable data using machine learning approaches that leverage the circadian desynchrony in a potential PTSD population.",Kerry J Ressler; Qiao Li; Ay S Cakmak; Erick A Perez Alday; Giulia Da Poian; Ali Bahrami Rad; Thomas J Metzler; Thomas C Neylan; Stacey L House; Francesca L Beaudoin; Xinming An; Jennifer Stevens; Donglin Zeng; Sarah D Linnstaedt; Tanja Jovanovic; Laura T Germine; Gari D Clifford; Kenneth A Bollen; Scott L Rauch; Christopher Lewandowski; Phy L Hendry; Sophia Sheikh; Allan B Storrow; Paul I Musey; John P Haran; Christopher W Jones; Brittany E Punches; Robert A Swor; Nina T Gentile; M E Mcgrath; Mark J Seamon; Kamran Mohiuddin; Anna M Chang; Claire Pearson; Robert M Domeier; St E Bruce; Brian J O'Neil; Niels K Rathlev; Leon D Sanchez; S A Mclean; Robert H Pietrzak; Jutta Joormann; Deanna M Barch; Diego Pizzagalli; St E Harte; Ja M Elliott; Karestan C Koenen; Ronald Kessler,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,,Research Board,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Steven,Bruce,Internal capsule microstructure mediates the relationship between childhood maltreatment and PTSD following adulthood trauma exposure,Molecular psychiatry,3/17/2023,2023.0,,,,,Completed/Published,10.1038/s41380-023-02012-3,36932158,,1476-5578,Spring,2023,"Childhood trauma is a known risk factor for trauma and stress-related disorders in adulthood. However, limited research has investigated the impact of childhood trauma on brain structure linked to later posttraumatic dysfunction. We investigated the effect of childhood trauma on white matter microstructure after recent trauma and its relationship with future posttraumatic dysfunction among trauma-exposed adult participants (n = 202) recruited from emergency departments as part of the AURORA Study. Participants completed self-report scales assessing prior childhood maltreatment within 2-weeks in addition to assessments of PTSD, depression, anxiety, and dissociation symptoms within 6-months of their traumatic event. Fractional anisotropy (FA) obtained from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) collected at 2-weeks and 6-months was used to index white matter microstructure. Childhood maltreatment load predicted 6-month PTSD symptoms (b = 1.75, SE = 0.78, 95% CI = [0.20, 3.29]) and inversely varied with FA in the bilateral internal capsule (IC) at 2-weeks (p = 0.0294, FDR corrected) and 6-months (p = 0.0238, FDR corrected). We observed a significant indirect effect of childhood maltreatment load on 6-month PTSD symptoms through 2-week IC microstructure (b = 0.37, Boot SE = 0.18, 95% CI = [0.05, 0.76]) that fully mediated the effect of childhood maltreatment load on PCL-5 scores (b = 1.37, SE = 0.79, 95% CI = [-0.18, 2.93]). IC microstructure did not mediate relationships between childhood maltreatment and depressive, anxiety, or dissociative symptomatology. Our findings suggest a unique role for IC microstructure as a stable neural pathway between childhood trauma and future PTSD symptoms following recent trauma. Notably, our work did not support roles of white matter tracts previously found to vary with PTSD symptoms and childhood trauma exposure, including the cingulum bundle, uncinate fasciculus, and corpus callosum. Given the IC contains sensory fibers linked to perception and motor control, childhood maltreatment might impact the neural circuits that relay and process threat-related inputs and responses to trauma.",Diego A Pizzagalli; S A Wong; Lauren A M Lebois; Timothy D Ely; Sanne J H van Rooij; St E Bruce; Vishnu P Murty; Tanja Jovanovic; Stacey L House; Francesca L Beaudoin; Xinming An; Donglin Zeng; Thomas C Neylan; Gari D Clifford; Sarah D Linnstaedt; Laura T Germine; Kenneth A Bollen; Scott L Rauch; John P Haran; Alan B Storrow; Christopher Lewandowski; Paul I Musey; Phy L Hendry; Sophia Sheikh; Christopher W Jones; Brittany E Punches; Mi C Kurz; Robert A Swor; L A Hudak; Jose L Pascual; Mark J Seamon; Claire Pearson; D A Peak; Roland C Merchant; Robert M Domeier; Niels K Rathlev; Brian J O'Neil; Paulina Sergot; Leon D Sanchez; Mark W Miller; Robert H Pietrzak; Jutta Joormann; Deanna M Barch; St E Harte; Ja M Elliott; Ronald C Kessler; Karestan C Koenen; S A McLean; Kerry J Ressler; Jennifer S Stevens; Nathaniel G Harnett,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Variability in resting-state networks (RSNs), patterns of intrinsic functional connectivity across the brain, has previously been linked to PTSD, and may thus be informative of PTSD susceptibility. The present data are part of an initial analysis from the AURORA study, a longitudinal, multisite study of adverse neuropsychiatric sequalae. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 109 recently (i.e., ~2 weeks) traumatized individuals were collected and PTSD and depression symptoms were assessed at 3 months post trauma. We assessed commonly reported RSNs including the default mode network (DMN), central executive network (CEN), and salience network (SN). We also identified a proposed arousal network (AN) composed of a priori brain regions important for PTSD: the amygdala, hippocampus, mamillary bodies, midbrain, and pons. Primary analyses assessed whether variability in functional connectivity at the 2-week imaging timepoint predicted 3-month PTSD symptom severity. Left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) to AN connectivity at 2 weeks post trauma was negatively related to 3-month PTSD symptoms. Further, right inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) to DMN connectivity was positively related to 3-month PTSD symptoms. Both DLPFC-AN and ITG-DMN connectivity also predicted depression symptoms at 3 months. Our results suggest that, following trauma exposure, acutely assessed variability in RSN connectivity was associated with PTSD symptom severity approximately two and a half months later. However, these patterns may reflect general susceptibility to posttraumatic dysfunction as the imaging patterns were not linked to specific disorder symptoms, at least in the subacute/early chronic phase. The present data suggest that assessment of RSNs in the early aftermath of trauma may be informative of susceptibility to posttraumatic dysfunction, with future work needed to understand neural markers of long-term (e.g., 12 months post trauma) dysfunction. Furthermore, these findings are consistent with neural models suggesting that decreased top-down cortico-limbic regulation and increased network-mediated fear generalization may contribute to ongoing dysfunction in the aftermath of trauma.",Brittany E Punches; Christopher W Jones; Robert M Domeier; Niels K Rathlev; Leon D Sanchez; Scott L Rauch; Xinming An; John P Haran; Paul I Musey; St E Bruce; Kerry J Ressler; Alan B Storrow; Sophia Sheikh; Stacey L House; Jennifer S Stevens; Francesca L Beaudoin; Nathaniel G Harnett; Kenneth A Bollen; Laura T Germine; Sarah D Linnstaedt; Claire Pearson; Sanne J H van Rooij; Timothy D Ely; Lauren A M Lebois; Vishnu P Murty; Gari D Clifford; Jutta Joormann; Anna M Chang; Tanja Jovanovic; Thomas C Neylan; Sarah B Hill; Donglin Zeng; Robert H Pietrzak; Nathalie M Dumornay; Ronald C Kessler; Ja M Elliott; St E Harte; Diego A Pizzagalli; John F Sheridan; Jose L Pascual; Mark J Seamon; M E McGrath; Karestan C Koenen; Phy L Hendry; Deanna M Barch; Samuel Mclean; Kamran Mohiuddin; Robert A Swor; Christopher Lewandowski; Julia B Merker; D A Peak,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,,,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Steven,Bruce,Structural covariance of the ventral visual stream predicts posttraumatic intrusion and nightmare symptoms: a multivariate data fusion analysis,Translational psychiatry,8/8/2022,2022.0,12,321,,,Completed/Published,10.1038/s41398-022-02085-8,35941117,PMC9360028,2158-3188,Fall,2022,"Visual components of trauma memories are often vividly re-experienced by survivors with deleterious consequences for normal function. Neuroimaging research on trauma has primarily focused on threat-processing circuitry as core to trauma-related dysfunction. Conversely, limited attention has been given to visual circuitry which may be particularly relevant to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Prior work suggests that the ventral visual stream is directly related to the cognitive and affective disturbances observed in PTSD and may be predictive of later symptom expression. The present study used multimodal magnetic resonance imaging data (n = 278) collected two weeks after trauma exposure from the AURORA study, a longitudinal, multisite investigation of adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae. Indices of gray and white matter were combined using data fusion to identify a structural covariance network (SCN) of the ventral visual stream 2 weeks after trauma. Participant's loadings on the SCN were positively associated with both intrusion symptoms and intensity of nightmares. Further, SCN loadings moderated connectivity between a previously observed amygdala-hippocampal functional covariance network and the inferior temporal gyrus. Follow-up MRI data at 6 months showed an inverse relationship between SCN loadings and negative alterations in cognition in mood. Further, individuals who showed decreased strength of the SCN between 2 weeks and 6 months had generally higher PTSD symptom severity over time. The present findings highlight a role for structural integrity of the ventral visual stream in the development of PTSD. The ventral visual stream may be particularly important for the consolidation or retrieval of trauma memories and may contribute to efficient reactivation of visual components of the trauma memory, thereby exacerbating PTSD symptoms. Potentially chronic engagement of the network may lead to reduced structural integrity which becomes a risk factor for lasting PTSD symptoms.",Francesca L Beaudoin; Erica Harris; Anna M Chang; Claire Pearson; Jose L Pascual; D A Peak; Robert M Domeier; Niels K Rathlev; Brian J O'Neil; Paulina Sergot; Leon D Sanchez; Mark W Miller; Robert H Pietrzak; Jutta Joormann; Deanna M Barch; Diego A Pizzagalli; John F Sheridan; St E Harte; Ja M Elliott; Ronald C Kessler; L A Hudak; Robert A Swor; Mi C Kurz; Brittany E Punches; Christopher W Jones; Sophia Sheikh; Karestan C Koenen; S A McLean; Lisa D Nickerson; Kerry J Ressler; Jennifer S Stevens; Phy L Hendry; Stacey L House; St E Bruce; Tanja Jovanovic; Vishnu P Murty; Timothy D Ely; Sanne J H van Rooij; Lauren A M Lebois; Kath E Finegold; Nathaniel G Harnett; Paul I Musey; Christopher Lewandowski; Alan B Storrow; John P Haran; Scott L Rauch; Kenneth A Bollen; Laura T Germine; Sarah D Linnstaedt; Gari D Clifford; Thomas C Neylan; Donglin Zeng; Xinming An; Mark J Seamon,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,,Research Board,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Steven,Bruce,(R) Posttraumatic stress disorder symptom clusters are differentially related to functional connectivity in affective and default mode networks,Brain and Behavior ,,2019.0,,"(31 pages, typed double-spaced)",,,Submitted,,,,,Spring,2023,"Background: Numerous studies report altered functional connectivity in various brain networks in subjects with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) compared to controls. Moreover, connectivity in the affective network (AN) and default mode network (DMN) corresponds to total PTSD symptom severity. Despite these results, there is little research to date that has examined whether functional connectivity in these networks corresponds to specific PTSD symptom clusters. 
Methods: Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans were collected in 63 women aged 18-55 with PTSD. Seed-based functional connectivity analyses examined the relationship between connectivity in AN and DMN seeds and PTSD symptom clusters. 
Results: Total PTSD symptom severity was related to functional connectivity between numerous DMN seeds and middle frontal gyrus. PTSD symptom clusters were differentially related to resting state connectivity in both networks. Avoidance symptoms correlated with midline DMN connectivity while hyperarousal symptoms correlated with connectivity between a DMN seed and striatum. Re-experiencing symptoms were correlated with connectivity between the left amygdala seed in the AN and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. 
Conclusion: These results suggest that unique brain networks underlie the expression of PTSD symptoms. Outcomes from the present study may inform treatments targeting specific PTSD symptoms and corresponding brain systems.

However, findings for many regions, particularly regions outside commonly studied emotion-related prefrontal, insular, and limbic regions, are inconsistent and tentative. Also, few studies address the possibility that PTSD abnormalities may be confounded by comorbid depression. A mega-analysis investigating all cortical regions in a large sample of PTSD and control subjects can potentially provide new insight into these issues. Given this perspective, our group aggregated regional volumes data of 68 cortical regions across both hemispheres from 1379 PTSD patients to 2192 controls without PTSD after data were processed by 32 international laboratories using ENIGMA standardized procedures. We examined whether regional cortical volumes were different in PTSD vs. controls, were associated with posttraumatic stress symptom (PTSS) severity, or were affected by comorbid depression. Volumes of left and right lateral orbitofrontal gyri (LOFG), left superior temporal gyrus, and right insular, lingual and superior parietal gyri were significantly smaller, on average, in PTSD patients than controls (standardized coefficients = -0.111 to -0.068, FDR corrected P values < 0.039) and were significantly negatively correlated with PTSS severity. After adjusting for depression symptoms, the PTSD findings in left and right LOFG remained significant.

Neuroimaging research has implicated cortical midline brain structures, including the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and isthmus cingulate (IsthCing), in rumination in healthy and depressed populations. While past research has revealed dysfunction in cortical midline regions in PTSD, no studies have yet investigated the structural and functional neural mechanisms underlying rumination in women with PTSD. In the current study, we used structural MRI and resting-state fMRI to examine relationships between rumination and brain volume, as well as resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of cortical midline structures in women with PTSD due to interpersonal trauma (N = 71). We performed multiple linear regression analyses to relate brain volume in rACC, PCC, and IsthCing regions to self-reported rumination, after controlling for age and total intracranial volume. We also conducted standard seed-based voxelwise rsFC analyses for significant regions identified in the structural analysis. We found a significant relationship between greater rumination and volume in the left IsthCing (p = .025). Results from the rsFC analyses revealed a significant relationship between greater rumination and diminished rsFC between the left IsthCing and left precuneus (p < .05). These findings provide novel support for alterations in the neural substrates of ruminative thought in women with PTSD. More broadly, we discuss clinical implications for targeted interventions to reduce rumination through psychotherapy or non-invasive brain stimulation.",Sally Pessin; Carissa L Philippi; Tasheia Floyd; St E Bruce; Leah Reyna,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,,Research Board,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Although studies have established relationships between neuroticism and neurological functioning in various brain regions for healthy and depressed individuals, the specific neural correlates of neuroticism for individuals with PTSD are yet unknown. This relationship is particularly relevant for women, given that their increased risk for PTSD is partially accounted for by their higher baseline levels of neuroticism. The current study examined previously established neural correlates of neuroticism in 61 women (48 women with interpersonal violence [IPV]/PTSD and 13 healthy controls). A specific region of interest map, including the amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), was examined while participants completed an emotional conflict task. Results showed that the PTSD group had significantly higher neuroticism scores than the healthy control group ( t = 6.90, p < .001). Higher neuroticism scores were associated with increased neural activity in the right dmPFC when participants were instructed to directly attend to faces with negative emotional valences. Significant trends between higher neuroticism scores and greater right amygdala and right ACC activation also emerged for this condition. Finally, neuroticism was found to be associated with right amygdala and right parahippocampal activity when participants were instructed to ignore faces with negative emotional valences. The results of this study lend further evidence to the proposed diathesis-stress model of neuroticism and PTSD. Moreover, findings suggest a significant association between neuroticism and neural activity in brain regions associated with fear and emotion regulation for women with IPV and subsequent PTSD.",Yvette I Sheline; Melissa Turkel; David Strasshofer; Tessa Vuper; Jessic A Wojtalik; Nicholas Brown; St E Bruce,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,,Research Board,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Sleep concerns have been associated with PTSS and somatic symptoms. Previous research suggests that sleep affects multiple domains of functioning including comorbid psychological and physical health concerns. The current study examines whether perceived sleep quality or sleep efficiency/duration may be mediating the relationship between PTSS and somatic symptoms in a trauma-exposed sample. Method: The sample consisted of 864 students, recruited from a large Midwestern university and compensated with research participation credit. Data were collected online over approximately 39 months (October 2015 through January 2019), and the pertinent scales examined in this study included Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition, and Screening for Somatoform Symptoms-7. Results: Of the 864 students, 668 participants identified as female (77.3%) and 540 identified as non-Hispanic White (62.5%), with an overall average age of 23.14 years (SD = 6.64). Mediation analyses indicated that the overall model examining global sleep quality complaints as a mechanism of the relationship between PTSS and somatic symptoms was significant, F(3, 860) = 193.97, R² = .40, p < .001, and that perceived sleep quality was found to be the only significant specific mediator (indirect effect = .21). Although females reported greater somatic severity, PTSS, and sleep concerns, models were significant, even after examining the influence of gender. Conclusions: Global sleep complaints are associated with both PTSS and somatic symptoms. Perceived sleep quality specifically mediated the relationship between PTSS and somatic symptoms, highlighting a potential intervention for improving physical health consequences in trauma-exposed individuals.",S A Challa; Gregory S Sayuk; Kamila S White; Robert Graziano; David R Strasshofer; St E Bruce,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,,Research Board,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Steven,Bruce,Dimensional depression severity in women with major depression and post-traumatic stress disorder correlates with fronto-amygdalar hypoconnectivty,Molecular psychiatry,4/4/2016,2016.0,,,,,Completed/Published,10.1038/mp.2015.149,26416545,,1476-5578,Spring,2016,"Depressive symptoms are common in multiple psychiatric disorders and are frequent sequelae of trauma. A dimensional conceptualization of depression suggests that symptoms should be associated with a continuum of deficits in specific neural circuits. However, most prior investigations of abnormalities in functional connectivity have typically focused on a single diagnostic category using hypothesis-driven seed-based analyses. Here, using a sample of 105 adult female participants from three diagnostic groups (healthy controls, n=17; major depression, n=38; and post-traumatic stress disorder, n=50), we examine the dimensional relationship between resting-state functional dysconnectivity and severity of depressive symptoms across diagnostic categories using a data-driven analysis (multivariate distance-based matrix regression). This connectome-wide analysis identified foci of dysconnectivity associated with depression severity in the bilateral amygdala. Follow-up seed analyses using subject-specific amygdala segmentations revealed that depression severity was associated with amygdalo-frontal hypo-connectivity in a network of regions including bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate and anterior insula. In contrast, anxiety was associated with elevated connectivity between the amygdala and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Taken together, these results emphasize the centrality of the amygdala in the pathophysiology of depressive symptoms, and suggest that dissociable patterns of amygdalo-frontal dysconnectivity are a critical neurobiological feature across clinical diagnostic categories.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 29 September 2015; doi:10.1038/mp.2015.149.",Y I Sheline; T D Satterthwaite; P A Cook; S E Bruce; C Conway; E Mikkelsen; E Satchell; S N Vandekar; T Durbin; R T Shinohara,,,,,Research Board,,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Contemporary literature has firmly established heightened negative affect (NA) as a risk and maintenance factor for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, the relationship between NA and PTSD symptoms is not well understood within IPT survivors, the majority of whom are female, as much of this research has focused on combat veterans. In addition, the connection between positive affect (PA) and PTSD symptoms has yet to be examined. With increased emphasis on ""negative alterations in cognitions and mood . . ."" as an independent symptom cluster of PTSD in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.; DSM-5), understanding the relationship between self-reported affectivity and the classic PTSD symptom clusters may be increasingly useful in differentiating symptom presentations of trauma-related psychopathology. The current study directly compared self-reported trait NA and PA with total severity and frequency cluster scores from the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) in 54 female survivors of IPT who met criteria for PTSD. Results identify NA (but not PA) as a consistent predictor of total PTSD symptoms and, specifically, re-experiencing symptoms.",Wilson J Brown; Yvette I Sheline; Katherine R Buchholz; Tiffany M Artime; Emily Hu; Steven E Bruce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the assumption that PTSD develops from dysregulated fear circuitry possesses limitations that detract from the potential efficacy of CBT approaches. An analysis of these limitations may provide insight into improvements to the CBT approach to PTSD, beginning with an examination of negative affect as an essential component to the conceptualization of PTSD and a barrier to the implementation of CBT for PTSD. As such, the literature regarding the impact of negative affect on aspects of cognition (i.e., attention, processing, memory, and emotion regulation) necessary for the successful application of CBT was systematically reviewed. Several literature databases were explored (e.g., PsychINFO and PubMed), resulting in 25 articles that met criteria for inclusion. Results of the review indicated that high negative affect generally disrupts cognitive processes, resulting in a narrowed focus on stimuli of a negative valence, increased rumination of negative autobiographical memories, inflexible preservation of initial information, difficulty considering counterfactuals, reliance on emotional reasoning, and misinterpretation of neutral or ambiguous events as negative, among others. With the aim to improve treatment efficacy of CBT for PTSD, suggestions to incorporate negative affect into research and clinical contexts are discussed.",Meliss A Mitchell; Brian E Bunnell; Wilson J Brown; Daniel Dewey; Stephen J Boyd; Allison K Wilkerson; St E Bruce,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,,,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Lead / Corresponding author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Results revealed higher radial diffusivity in the anterior thalamic radiation among SOD2 CC genotypes compared to CT/TT genotypes. Further, the CC genotype moderated the relationship between the hippocampal cingulum and processing speed, though this did not survive multiple test correction.

We focus on n = 666 participants presenting to EDs following a motor vehicle collision (MVC) and examine associations of participant socio-demographic and participant-reported MVC characteristics with 8-week posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) adjusting for pre-MVC PTSD and mediated by peritraumatic symptoms and 2-week acute stress disorder (ASD). Peritraumatic Symptoms, ASD, and PTSD were assessed with self-report scales.

A significant subset of this population will still develop persistent pain and posttraumatic psychological sequelae may play an important role in pain persistence. Methods: We conducted a multisite longitudinal cohort study of adverse post-traumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae among patients seeking ED treatment in the aftermath of a traumatic life experience. We report on a sub-group of patients (n = 666) presenting after an MVC, the most common type of trauma and we examine associations of socio-demographic and MVC characteristics, and persistent pain 8 weeks after MVC. We also examine the degree to which these associations are related to peritraumatic psychological symptoms and 2-week acute stress reactions using an applied approach. Results: Eight-week prevalence of persistent moderate or severe pain was high (67.4%) and positively associated with patient sex (female), older age, low socioeconomic status (education and income) and pain severity in the ED. Peritraumatic stress symptoms (distress and dissociation) appear to exert some influence on both acute pain and the transition from acute to persistent pain. Discussion and conclusions: The early aftermath of an MVC may be an important time period for intervening to prevent and reduce persistent pain. Substantial variation in mediating pathways across predictors also suggests potential diverse and complex underlying biological and psychological pathogenic processes are at work in the early weeks following trauma.  Significance: The first several days after trauma may dictate recovery trajectories. Persistent pain, pain lasting beyond the expected time of recovery, is associated with pain early in the recovery period, but also mediated through other pathways. Future work is needed to understand the complex neurobiological processes in involved in the development of persistent and acute post-traumatic pain.",D A Peak; Karestan C Koenen; S A McLean; Steven E Bruce; Niels K Rathlev; Leon D Sanchez; Roland Merchant; Robert M Domeier; Claire Pearson; AM Chang; Kamran Mohiuddin; M E McGrath; R Swor; M Lyons; Brittany E Punches; Christopher W Jones; John P Haran; A Storrow; Paul I Musey; Sophia Sheikh; Phy L Hendry; C Lewandowski; S House; Kerry J Ressler; J M Elliott; St E Harte; J F Sheridan; Diego A Pizzagalli; Scott L Rauch; Deanna Barch; Jutta Joormann; Sarah D Linnstaedt; Gari Clifford; Thomas C Neylan; Donglin Zeng; Jennifer S Stevens; Xinming An; Nancy Sampson; Sue Lee; Irving Hwang; Ronald C Kessler; Francesca L Beaudoin; R Pietrzak,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,,Research Board,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

This trend is evident in and applicable to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) treatment research given the high nonresponse rate of individuals with PTSD who undergo cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Functional connectivity analyses investigating disrupted brain networks across mental disorders have been employed to understand both mental disorder symptoms and therapeutic mechanisms. However, few studies have examined pre-post CBT brain changes in PTSD using functional connectivity analyses. The current study investigated a) whether brain networks commonly implicated in psychopathology (e.g., default mode network [DMN], central executive network [CEN], and salience network [SN]) changed following Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) for PTSD and b) whether change in these networks was associated with PTSD and/or transdiagnostic symptom change. Independent components analysis was implemented to investigate resting-state functional connectivity in DMN, CEN, and SN in 42 women with PTSD and 18 trauma-exposed controls (TEC). Results indicated decreased CEN-cerebellum connectivity in PTSD participants versus TEC prior to CPT and decreased DMN connectivity in PTSD participants after CPT. Additionally, DMN and SN connectivity was related to change in positive and negative affectivity, while exploratory analyses at a cluster threshold of pFDR < .10 indicated DMN and SN connectivity was also related to change in PTSD symptoms and rumination. These findings provide evidence for normalization of CEN connectivity with treatment and implicate the DMN and SN in clinical symptom change following CPT.",St E Bruce; Carissa L Philippi; Tessa C Vuper,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,,,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

This report from the AURORA study focuses on associations of pre-MVC sleep problems with these outcomes 8 weeks after MVC mediated through peritraumatic distress and dissociation and 2-week outcomes.
Methods: 666 AURORA patients completed self-report assessments in the ED and at 2 and 8 weeks after MVC. Peritraumatic distress, peritraumatic dissociation and pre-MVC sleep characteristics (insomnia, nightmares, daytime sleepiness and sleep duration in the 30 days before the MVC, trait sleep stress reactivity) were assessed retrospectively in the ED. The survey assessed acute stress disorder (ASD) and MDE at 2 weeks and at 8 weeks assessed PTSD and MDE (past 30 days). Control variables included demographics, MVC characteristics, and retrospective reports about PTSD and MDE in the 30 days before the MVC.
Results: Prevalence estimates were 41.0% for 2-week ASD, 42.0% for 8-week PTSD, 30.5% for 2-week MDE, and 27.2% for 8-week MDE. Pre-MVC nightmares and sleep stress reactivity predicted 8-week PTSD (mediated through 2-week ASD) and MDE (mediated through the transition between 2-week and 8-week MDE). Pre-MVC insomnia predicted 8-week PTSD (mediated through 2-week ASD).

This study addressed this gap by examining the microstructural integrity of the corpus callosum, the largest white matter fiber bundle in the brain, using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Sixty adult females diagnosed with PTSD with a history of interpersonal violence were compared with 18 trauma-exposed controls. All participants underwent DTI using 1.5 T. MANOVA revealed significantly higher fractional anisotropy (FA; p = .012) in the genu of the corpus callosum (GCC) compared with the trauma-exposed controls.

We found that higher levels of PTSD-related hyperarousal symptoms were significantly associated with diminished self-related word use, after controlling for depression severity, f = .31. Similarly, diminished negative self-related word use was associated with higher levels of hyperarousal symptoms, f = .47.

Variability in resting-state networks (RSNs), patterns of intrinsic functional connectivity across the brain, has previously been linked to PTSD, and may thus be informative of PTSD susceptibility. The present data are part of an initial analysis from the AURORA study, a longitudinal, multisite study of adverse neuropsychiatric sequalae. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 109 recently (i.e., ~2 weeks) traumatized individuals were collected and PTSD and depression symptoms were assessed at 3 months post trauma. We assessed commonly reported RSNs including the default mode network (DMN), central executive network (CEN), and salience network (SN). We also identified a proposed arousal network (AN) composed of a priori brain regions important for PTSD: the amygdala, hippocampus, mamillary bodies, midbrain, and pons. Primary analyses assessed whether variability in functional connectivity at the 2-week imaging timepoint predicted 3-month PTSD symptom severity. Left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) to AN connectivity at 2 weeks post trauma was negatively related to 3-month PTSD symptoms. Further, right inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) to DMN connectivity was positively related to 3-month PTSD symptoms. Both DLPFC-AN and ITG-DMN connectivity also predicted depression symptoms at 3 months. Our results suggest that, following trauma exposure, acutely assessed variability in RSN connectivity was associated with PTSD symptom severity approximately two and a half months later. However, these patterns may reflect general susceptibility to posttraumatic dysfunction as the imaging patterns were not linked to specific disorder symptoms, at least in the subacute/early chronic phase. The present data suggest that assessment of RSNs in the early aftermath of trauma may be informative of susceptibility to posttraumatic dysfunction, with future work needed to understand neural markers of long-term (e.g., 12 months post trauma) dysfunction. Furthermore, these findings are consistent with neural models suggesting that decreased top-down cortico-limbic regulation and increased network-mediated fear generalization may contribute to ongoing dysfunction in the aftermath of trauma.",NM Dumornay; JB Merker; Steven Edward Bruce; LA Lebois; TD Ely; T Jovanovic; NG Hartnett; SJH van Rooij; VP Murty; SB Hill,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,,Research Board,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

In this study, we applied tools from graph theory and network science to better understand the transdiagnostic neural mechanisms of this treatment for depression. A sample of 64 subjects was included in a study of network dynamics: 33 patients (15 MDD, 18 PTSD) received longitudinal fMRI resting state scans before and after 12 weeks of CBT. Depression severity was rated on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Thirty-one healthy controls were included to determine baseline network roles. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were conducted on the normalized change scores of within- and between-system connectivity and normalized change score of the MADRS. Penalized regression was used to select a sparse set of predictors in a data-driven manner. Univariate analyses showed greater symptom reduction was associated with an increased functional role of the Ventral Attention (VA) system as an incohesive provincial system (decreased between- and decreased within-system connectivity). Multivariate analyses selected between-system connectivity of the VA system as the most prominent feature associated with depression improvement. Observed VA system changes are interesting in light of brain controllability descriptions: attentional control systems, including the VA system, fall on the boundary between-network communities, and facilitate integration or segregation of diverse cognitive systems. Thus, increasing segregation of the VA system following CBT (decreased between-network connectivity) may result in less contribution of emotional attention to cognitive processes, thereby potentially improving cognitive control.",Christos Davatzikos; Yvette I Sheline; Theo D Satterthwaite; Nicolas Honnorat; Shi Gu; Zhen Yang; Danielle S Bassett; Kristin A Linn; Russell T Shinohara; Irem Aselcioglu; Steven Bruce; Desmond J Oathes,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,,Research Board,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Comparing regional white matter metrics across the full brain in 1426 individuals with PTSD and 1621 controls (2174 males/873 females) between ages 18-83, 92% of whom were trauma-exposed, we report associations between PTSD and disrupted white matter organization measured by lower fractional anisotropy (FA) in the tapetum region of the corpus callosum (Cohen's d = -0.11, p = 0.0055). The tapetum connects the left and right hippocampus, for which structure and function have been consistently implicated in PTSD.

Steven,Bruce,Rumination Mediates the Relationship Between Negative Affect and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms in Female Interpersonal Trauma Survivors,Journal of interpersonal violence,12/17/2018,2018.0,,8.86E+14,,,Completed/Published,10.1177/0886260518818434,30556467,,1552-6518,Fall,2018,"Prior research has identified both rumination and negative affect (NA) as dimensional constructs related to the development and maintenance of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). While both dimensions demonstrate significant positive relationships with symptoms of PTSD, the relationship between the two within the context of the disorder has yet to be explored. Consistent with prior research in the social anxiety literature, the present study seeks to examine a model of mediation by which rumination accounts for the significant relationship between NA and PTSD symptoms. Participants included 65 female interpersonal trauma survivors diagnosed with PTSD using structured, clinician-administered interviews. Both NA and rumination were observed as significant predictors of PTSD symptoms, and the variables were significantly associated with each other. However, NA was no longer a significant predictor of PTSD symptoms when rumination was entered into the mediation model, suggesting full mediation of the relationship by rumination. Results from the current study suggest a complex relationship between NA and rumination in interpersonal trauma survivors with PTSD, such that a ruminative cognitive coping style may either mitigate or exacerbate PTSD symptoms in the presence of sustained negative emotion. The current findings provide support for a cognitive model of PTSD, within which PTSD symptoms are influenced via negative, ruminative cognitions. Primary implications of these results include (a) the consideration of assessment of rumination in interpersonal trauma survivors with PTSD in clinical settings; (b) the selection of treatment that may address a ruminative cognitive style in this population, given the mediation between subjective distress and PTSD symptoms by rumination; and (c) the necessity for the validation of this mediation model within other traumatized populations.",Wilson J Brown; St E Bruce; Meliss A Mitchell; Melanie D Hetzel-Riggin,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,,Research Board,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

These APNS, as traditionally classified, include posttraumatic stress, postconcussion syndrome, depression, and regional or widespread pain. Traditional classifications have come to hamper scientific progress because they artificially fragment APNS into siloed, syndromic diagnoses unmoored to discrete components of brain functioning and studied in isolation. These limitations in classification and ontology slow the discovery of pathophysiologic mechanisms, biobehavioral markers, risk prediction tools, and preventive/treatment interventions. Progress in overcoming these limitations has been challenging because such progress would require studies that both evaluate a broad spectrum of posttraumatic sequelae (to overcome fragmentation) and also perform in-depth biobehavioral evaluation (to index sequelae to domains of brain function). This article summarizes the methods of the Advancing Understanding of RecOvery afteR traumA (AURORA) Study. AURORA conducts a large-scale (n = 5000 target sample) in-depth assessment of APNS development using a state-of-the-art battery of self-report, neurocognitive, physiologic, digital phenotyping, psychophysical, neuroimaging, and genomic assessments, beginning in the early aftermath of trauma and continuing for 1 year. The goals of AURORA are to achieve improved phenotypes, prediction tools, and understanding of molecular mechanisms to inform the future development and testing of preventive and treatment interventions.",Xinming An; Ronald Kessler; Alan M Zaslavsky; Tushar Parlikar; Menachem Fromer; Archana Basu; Ja M Elliott; John F Sheridan; Elisabeth Binder; Thaddeus W W Pace; Robert F Dougherty; Jordan W Smoller; Beatriz Luna; Sanne J H van Rooij; Lauren A M Lebois; Deanna M Barch; Larry J Young; St E Harte; Scott L Rauch; Diego A Pizzagalli; Daniel J Buysse; Robert H Pietrzak; Mark W Miller; Jutta Joormann; Bradley N Gaynes; St E Bruce; Jukka- P Onnela; Paul Dagum; Thomas R Insel; Vishnu P Murty; Claire Pearson; John P Haran; Robert Domeier; Niels Rathlev; Leon D Sanchez; Deborah Diercks; W F Peacock; Paulina Sergot; Mark J Seamon; Jose L Pascual; D A Peak; Anna M Chang; Nina Gentile; L A Hudak; Gregory J Fermann; M E McGrath; Mi C Kurz; Alan Storrow; Jennifer S Stevens; Kamran Mohiuddin; Elizabeth Datner; Robert Swor; Christopher Lewandowski; Christopher W Jones; Phyllis Hendry; Paul Musey; Kenneth A Bollen; Stacey House; Francesca Beaudoin; Sarah Linnstaedt; Donglin Zeng; Gari D Clifford; Tanja Jovanovic; Laura Germine; Thomas Neylan; Karestan C Koenen; Kerry Ressler; S A McLean,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,,Research Board,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Co-author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Similarly, individuals with a history of early life stress (ELS) exhibit lower FA in the white matter independent of concurrent depression. Prior studies have not determined whether the neuroimaging signature of comorbid ELS and adult depression differs from the pattern of brain white matter changes associated with depression in the absence of self-reported ELS. The current study examined FA in multiple white matter tracts in 186 adults (93 males; 93 females) with a current diagnosis of major depressive disorder, including 88 who reported a history of bullying before the age of 18 (43 males; 45 females). All patients were antidepressant medication free at the time of testing. After adjusting for demographics and other ELS subtypes, participants with a history of bullying exhibited increased FA in the right medial lemniscus (p =.039) and left posterior corona radiata (p =.008) compared to participants with depression but no self-reported history of bullying. Both groups endorsed similar levels of depression. Group differences were most pronounced among individuals who endorsed bullying in late adolescence (14-17 years of age). Results suggest bullying in late adolescence is uniquely related to abnormal brain microstructure among individuals with current diagnoses of depression, possibly due to an overactive fear response. Further work is needed to differentiate why ELS within bullying is associated with higher FA.",Robert H Paul; St E Bruce; Mayure S Korgaonkar; Leanne M Williams; Robert C Graziano,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,,,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Lead / Corresponding author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

While it is the region boasting the greatest numbers of women executives to date, women face many limits in the types of positions they occupy and powers afforded in their offices, though important exceptions surface. Statistically, womens success relates to the commonality of dual executive structures. Likewise critical is the legislative political pipeline from which future leaders are recruited. Finally, prospects for women leaders in Eastern Europe appear less auspicious than for their Western counterparts, further demonstrating womens uneven advances.",Farida Jalalzai,,,,,,,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,,,FAS and other legacy systems,
Farida,Jalalzai,"Shattered, Not Cracked, The Effect of Womens Executive Leadership. Journal of Women, Politics & Policy ","ournal of  Women, Politics & Policy ",12/1/2014,2014.0,,,,,Accepted,,,,,Fall,2014,"Several countries where women gained prime ministerial or presidential offices at earlier points witnessed the rise of at least one additional woman leader subsequently. Such contexts coexist with others stalled at only one case. Most commonly, countries have yet to be governed by any women, let alone several. What explains these differing patterns? This article examines two dynamics to answer this question: first, womens attainment of executive positions worldwide and secondly, the influence previous women leaders exert on the rise of female successors. I find a number of possible explanations why the glass ceiling cracked (defined as having had only one woman executive come to power) in some settings but shattered in others (delineated as having being led by at least two women). Institutional features appear most decisive in accounting for whether a country is led by a woman. Women more likely surface within contexts utilizing two executive positions and are less apt to do so in unified parliamentary systems. Multi-party systems and longer legislative pipelines also offer women greater chances for success. Countries led by a woman during a prior period are significantly more likely to see other women hold power in the future though this is dependent upon how many years have elapsed. These same institutional explanations facilitate multiple women executives as do systems with weak presidencies. Additionally, democracy, gender parity, longer histories of womens suffrage, and politically fragile contexts more often coincide with shattered glass ceilings.

Understanding tenure is crucial since the longer one is office, the greater potential for acquiring positions of leadership, expertise, and ultimately policy influence. Along with gender, we explore the impact of race/ethnicity, and partisanship on length of service. While controlling for a number of variables, we find these factors significantly related to tenure. For example, women and African-Americans have shorter House careers than their counterparts. The implications of this is clear- their potential impact on policy is severely undercut, and as a result, the potential for substantive representation. ",Chad A. Hankinson; David L.

APPROACH-IS was a cross-sectional, observational study that enrolled 4,028 patients from 15 countries (median age 32 years; 53% females). Self-report questionnaires were administered to measure PROs: health status; anxiety and depression; and quality of life. Overall, 668 patients (17%) had been hospitalized in the previous 12 months. These patients reported poorer outcomes on all PROs, with the exception of anxiety. Patients who underwent cardiac surgery demonstrated a better quality of life compared with those who were hospitalized for nonsurgical reasons. For significant differences, the effect sizes were small, whereas they were negligible in nonsignificant comparisons. Substantial inter-country differences were observed. For various PROs, moderate to large effect sizes were found comparing different countries.

Physical functioning, mental health, and QoL were measured with the SF-12 health status survey, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), linear analog scale (LAS) and Satisfaction with Life Scale, respectively. Functional class was assessed using the patient-reported New York Heart Association (NYHA) class. Multivariable general linear mixed models were applied to assess the relationship between the type of CHD and patient-reported outcomes, adjusted for patient characteristics, and with country as random effect.
Results: Patients with coarctation of the aorta and those with isolated aortic valve disease reported the best physical functioning, mental health, and QoL. Patients with cyanotic heart disease or Eisenmenger syndrome had worst outcomes. The differences were statistically significant, above and beyond other patient characteristics. However, the explained variances were small (0.6% to 4.1%) and decreased further when functional status was added to the models (0.4% to 0.9%).
Conclusions: Some types of CHD predict worse patient-reported outcomes. However, it appears that it is the functional status associated with the heart defect rather than the heart defect itself that shapes the outcomes.

This study aimed to describe health behaviours in adults with congenital heart disease in 15 countries and to identify patient characteristics associated with optimal health behaviours in the international sample.
Design: This was a cross-sectional observational study.
Methods : Adults with congenital heart disease (n = 4028, median age = 32 years, interquartile range 25–42 years) completed self-report measures as part of the Assessment of Patterns of Patient-Reported Outcomes in Adults with Congenital Heart disease - International Study (APPROACH-IS). Participants reported on seven health behaviours using the Health Behaviors Scale-Congenital Heart Disease. Demographic and medical characteristics were assessed via medical chart review and self-report. Multivariate path analyses with inverse sampling weights were used to investigate study aims.
Results: Health behaviour rates for the full sample were 10% binge drinking, 12% cigarette smoking, 6% recreational drug use, 72% annual dental visit, 69% twice daily tooth brushing, 27% daily dental flossing and 43% sport participation. Pairwise comparisons indicated that rates differed between countries. Rates of substance use behaviours were higher in younger, male participants. Optimal dental health behaviours were more common among older, female participants with higher educational attainment while sports participation was more frequent among participants who were younger, male, married, employed/students, with higher educational attainment, less complex anatomical defects and better functional status.
Conclusions: Health behaviour rates vary by country. Predictors of health behaviours may reflect larger geographic trends. Our findings have implications for the development and implementation of programmes for the assessment and promotion of optimal health behaviours in adults with congenital heart disease.

Previous research has confirmed the relationship between the perceived impact of stress on health and self-rated health. However, it remains unknown whether sense of coherence, a person's capacity to cope with stressors, moderates this relationship. This cross-sectional study aims to explore: the relationship between demographic and clinical characteristics, sense of coherence, and the perceived impact of stress on health; the relationship between the perceived impact of stress on health and self-rated health; and the moderating effect of sense of coherence in a sample of adults with congenital heart disease. Patients were recruited from the database of congenital and structural cardiology of a university hospital. The analytic sample included 255 patients (median age 35 years; 50% men). Data were obtained using self-report questionnaires and through medical record view. Univariate analyses and multiple regression analyses were conducted. The perceived impact of stress on health was negatively associated with sense of coherence (P<0.01), but there was no significant association with demographic or clinical characteristics. The perceived impact of stress on health and self-rated health were negatively associated (P<0.001), but sense of coherence did not moderate this relationship.

To derive cluster analysis-based groupings for adults with congenital heart disease (ACHD) when it comes to perceived health, psychological functioning, health behaviours and quality of life (QoL). Methods. This study was part of a larger worldwide multicentre study called APPROACH-IS; a cross sectional study which recruited 4028 patients (2013–2015) from 15 participating countries. A hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using Ward's method in order to group patients with similar psychological characteristics, which were defined by taking into consideration the scores of the following tests: Sense Of Coherence, Health Behavior Scale (physical exercise score), Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale, Illness Perception Questionnaire, Satisfaction with Life Scale and the Visual Analogue Scale scores of the EQ-5D perceived health scale and a linear analogue scale (0–100) measuring QoL. 
Results. 3768 patients with complete data were divided into 3 clusters. The first and second clusters represented 89.6% of patients in the analysis who reported a good health perception, QoL, psychological functioning and the greatest amount of exercise. Patients in the third cluster reported substantially lower scores in all PROs. This cluster was characterised by a significantly higher proportion of females, a higher average age the lowest education level, more complex forms of congenital heart disease and more medical comorbidities. 
Conclusions. This study suggests that certain demographic and clinical characteristics may be linked to less favourable health perception, quality of life, psychological functioning, and health behaviours in ACHD.

However, little is known about their impact on patient-reported outcomes (PROs).
Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess and compare PROs in adults with CHD with and without ICDs.
Methods: A propensity-based matching weight analysis was conducted to evaluate PROs in an international cross-sectional study of adults with CHD from 15 countries across 5 continents.
Results: A total of 3188 patients were included: 107 with ICDs and 3081 weight-matched controls without ICDs. ICD recipients were an average age of 40.1 ± 12.4 years, and >95% had moderate or complex CHD. Defibrillators were implanted for primary and secondary prevention in 38.3% and 61.7%, respectively. Perceived health status, psychological distress, sense of coherence, and health behaviors did not differ significantly among patients with and without ICDs. However, ICD recipients had a more threatening view of their illness (relative % difference 8.56; P = .011). Those with secondary compared to primary prevention indications had a significantly lower quality-of-life score (Linear Analogue Scale 72.0 ± 23.1 vs 79.2 ± 13.0; P = .047). Marked geographic variations were observed. Overall sense of well-being, assessed by a summary score that combines various PROs, was significantly lower in ICD recipients (vs controls) from Switzerland, Argentina, Taiwan, and the United States.
Conclusion: In an international cohort of adults with CHD, ICDs were associated with a more threatening illness perception, with a lower quality of life in those with secondary compared to primary prevention indications. However, marked geographic variability in PROs was observed.

Sleep concerns have been associated with PTSS and somatic symptoms. Previous research suggests that sleep affects multiple domains of functioning including comorbid psychological and physical health concerns. The current study examines whether perceived sleep quality or sleep efficiency/duration may be mediating the relationship between PTSS and somatic symptoms in a trauma-exposed sample. Method: The sample consisted of 864 students, recruited from a large Midwestern university and compensated with research participation credit. Data were collected online over approximately 39 months (October 2015 through January 2019), and the pertinent scales examined in this study included Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition, and Screening for Somatoform Symptoms-7. Results: Of the 864 students, 668 participants identified as female (77.3%) and 540 identified as non-Hispanic White (62.5%), with an overall average age of 23.14 years (SD = 6.64). Mediation analyses indicated that the overall model examining global sleep quality complaints as a mechanism of the relationship between PTSS and somatic symptoms was significant, F(3, 860) = 193.97, R² = .40, p < .001, and that perceived sleep quality was found to be the only significant specific mediator (indirect effect = .21). Although females reported greater somatic severity, PTSS, and sleep concerns, models were significant, even after examining the influence of gender. Conclusions: Global sleep complaints are associated with both PTSS and somatic symptoms. Perceived sleep quality specifically mediated the relationship between PTSS and somatic symptoms, highlighting a potential intervention for improving physical health consequences in trauma-exposed individuals.

However, the association between healthcare system inputs and patient-reported outcomes remains unclear. Hence, we explored the predictive value of human resources and infrastructures of the countries’ healthcare system on patient-reported outcomes in adults with congenital heart disease. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 3588 patients with congenital heart disease (median age = 31y; IQR = 16.0; 52% women; 26% simple, 49% moderate, and 25% complex defects) from 15 countries. The following patient-reported outcomes were measured: perceived physical and mental health, psychological distress, health behaviors, and quality of life. The assessed inputs of the healthcare system were: (i) human resources (i.e., density of physicians and nurses, both per 1000 people) and (ii) infrastructure (i.e., density of hospital beds per 10,000 people). Univariable, multivariable, and sensitivity analyses using general linear mixed models were conducted, adjusting for patient-specific variables and unmeasured country differences. Results: Sensitivity analyses showed that higher density of physicians was significantly associated with better self-reported physical and mental health, less psychological distress, and better quality of life. A greater number of nurses was significantly associated with better self-reported physical health, less psychological distress, and less risky health behavior. No associations between a higher density of hospital beds and patient-reported outcomes were observed.
Conclusions: This explorative study suggests that density of human resources for health, measured on country level, are associated with patient-reported outcomes in adults with congenital heart disease. More research needs to be conducted before firm conclusions about the relationships observed can be drawn.

Little is known about their effect on quality of life and other patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in adults with CHD.
Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of atrial arrhythmias on PROs in adults with CHD and explore geographic variations.
Methods: Associations between atrial arrhythmias and PROs were assessed in a cross-sectional study of adults with CHD from 15 countries spanning 5 continents. A propensity-based matching weight analysis was performed to compare quality of life, perceived health status, psychological distress, sense of coherence, and illness perception in patients with and those without atrial arrhythmias.
Results: A total of 4028 adults with CHD were enrolled, 707 (17.6%) of whom had atrial arrhythmias. After applying matching weights, patients with and those without atrial arrhythmias were comparable with regard to age (mean 40.1 vs 40.2 years), demographic variables (52.5% vs 52.2% women), and complexity of CHD (15.9% simple, 44.8% moderate, and 39.2% complex in both groups). Patients with atrial arrhythmias had significantly worse PRO scores with respect to quality of life, perceived health status, psychological distress (ie, depression), and illness perception. A summary score that combines all PRO measures was significantly lower in patients with atrial arrhythmias (–3.3%; P = .0006). Differences in PROs were consistent across geographic regions.
Conclusion: Atrial arrhythmias in adults with CHD are associated with an adverse impact on a broad range of PROs consistently across various geographic regions.

This market-oriented policy has forced social service nonprofits to adopt the market practice and culture. As a result, nonprofits are becoming business-like entities striving for a share of the social service market. This study examines organizational factors that give competitive advantage to nonprofits in the social service market under the voucher system. Specifically, the study uses data collected from 35 nonprofit organizations in Busan, South Korea, to examine whether voucher revenues, an indicator of market share, is associated with organizational characteristics, including organizational culture and structure. The results may suggest strategies that help nonprofits to gain a greater share in the social service market.",Kwon Sunae (Role:Author); Baorong Guo (Role:Author),,,Blind Peer Reviewed,International,None,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Co-author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,2.0

Methods: The study uses a repeated cross-sectional design with five years of data (2011–2015) from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) in the US. The difference-in-difference approach is applied to compare individuals with and without disabilities regarding their food security status in adolescence and young adulthood. Instrumental Variable analyses are conducted using state SNAP policy rules as exogenous instruments to estimate the effects of SNAP participation on food security status for youth and young adults with disabilities.
Results: Results indicate that transition into adulthood results in greater food security for individuals without disabilities but an increased risk of low food security for individuals with disabilities. The increased risk for young adults with disabilities may well put them at very low food security, the most severe category on the food security scale. SNAP participation appears to have greater impacts for youth than for young adults.
Conclusions: Since food security likely has a profound impact on the long-term development, economic independence, and self-sufficiency, we discuss a few policy strategies that may help individuals with disabilities in their transition to adulthood.",Jin Huang (Role:Author); Shirley Lynn Porterfield (Role:Author); Baorong Guo (Role:Author),,,Blind Peer Reviewed,National,Research Board,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Lead / Corresponding author,University of Kentucky Center on Poverty Research & USDA Economic Research Service,,,,English,,WOS,

Objective: This study examines how the transition to adulthood may affect the association between food security and self-rated health and healthcare needs for individuals with disabilities.
Methods: The study uses five years of data (2011–2015) from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). One health indicator, self-rated health status, and two indicators of unmet healthcare needs, delayed medical care and not receiving medical care due to cost, are analyzed as dependent variables. The effects of food security status on health and health-related outcomes are closely examined for the four groups: youth without disabilities, youth with disabilities, young adults without disabilities and young adults with disabilities.
Results: Results indicate a statistically significant association between food security status and self-rated health and unmet healthcare needs in late childhood and young adulthood. Such association is stronger for young adults than for youth. The association between low food security and self-rated health and health-related outcomes does not significantly differ between the two youth groups or the two young adult groups by disability status.
Conclusions: Suggestions for improving accessibility of public food and nutrition programs are discussed.

Using grounded theory and qualitative content analyses, results indicated substantial discourse around cultural competence in these documents. However, cultural competence was not clearly defined. A more straightforward focus on the centrality of cultural competence in school psychology training and practice could reduce negative outcomes for clients and families. Implications for practice, policy development, and future research are discussed.

Study 2 contained a subsample of 176 PST members who identified their teams as consistently using or occasionally/never using an agenda for their meetings. Across both studies, measures on PST intervention technology—Acceptability and Feasibility, Data-Based Decision-Making, Services to Minority Students, and Intervention Knowledge/Integrity—indicated that adhering to best practice by using a timekeeper and an agenda resulted in more positive outcomes for PSTs.

Three hundred sixty-nine PST members completed a revised version of the Problem-Solving Team Effectiveness Scale—Revised, a measure designed to assess best practices in intervention selection, implementation, and evaluation. Factor and parallel analyses identified four factors: Acceptability and Feasibility, Data-Based Decision Making, Services to Minority Students, and Knowledge of Interventions/ Integrity. Results showed that schools where RTI and MTSS were at a later implementation stage reported higher use on all intervention technology subscales except Services to Minority Students.

Several best practices by PSTs were initially identified through a review of the literature: knowledge of interventions and intervention effectiveness, data-based decision-making, intervention integrity, social validity, follow-up consultation with a problem identifier, and support for the PST. Together, these practices constitute an intervention technology for PSTs. After content validation, completion of the 25-item measure by PST members in four states from the Midwest United States yielded a five-factor solution via exploratory analysis, and subsequent parallel analysis reduced the solution to three factors: social validity, knowledge of interventions and intervention integrity, and follow up with problem identifiers. These subscales consistently differentiated PSTs with high meeting integrity, defined as use of a timekeeper and agenda, from those with lower meeting integrity. Additionally, a pattern of statistically significant correlations emerged between the subscales and typical PST activities, thereby contributing to the instrument’s convergent and discriminant validity.

First, we demonstrated that both company assigned goal and salespeoples self-set goal are positively related to their effort on selling new product. And more importantly, the relationships for both assigned goal and self-set goal are inverted U-shaped. Specifically, salespeople extend more effort when goal level increases until a threshold. Beyond the threshold, the selling effort decreases as goal level increases. This trend holds for both company assigned goal and salespeople self-set goal. Second, we advanced the goal setting theory by establishing the mediation effect of self-set goal. The fact that self-set goal fully mediates the relationship between assigned goal and selling effort possesses both theoretical and managerial implications. Third, in a longitudinal design, we tested and found support that company assigned goal, salespeoples self-set goal, and selling effort all positively influence new product performance.

It remains uncertain whether HAART regimens with a high degree of central nervous system penetration effectiveness (CPE) exert beneficial neurological outcomes in HIV-infected (HIV+) individuals on stable treatment. Sixty-four HIV-infected adults on HAART were assigned a CPE score using a published ranking system and divided into high (a parts per thousand yen7; n = 35) and low (< 7; n = 29) CPE groups. All participants completed neuropsychological testing in addition to structural neuroimaging. Neuropsychological tests included measures known to be sensitive to HIV with values converted into standardized scores (NPZ-4) based on published normative scores. A semi-automated methodology was utilized to assess brain volumetrics within cortical (grey and white matter) and subcortical (thalamus, caudate, putamen) regions of interest. Analyses assessed NPZ-4 and brain volumetric differences between HIV+ individuals with high and low CPE scores. No significant differences in brain integrity were observed between the two groups. Long-term HAART regimens with a high degree of CPE were not associated with significantly improved neuropsychological or neuroimaging outcomes in HIV+ adults. Results suggest that alternate mechanisms may potentially contribute to better neurological outcomes in the era of HAART.

A total of 478 children and adolescents (age 6-19) without significant medical or psychiatric history provided demographic information and completed a computerized cognitive test battery. Participants were categorized using clinical criteria into underweight, normal weight, at risk for overweight and overweight groups based on age and gender. Partial correlation and MANCOVA analyses adjusting for age and intellectual function found no relationship between BMI and cognitive test performance in the full sample. However, analyses performed separately by gender showed that underweight females exhibited poorer memory performance than other female BMI groups. These findings suggest that elevated BMI is not associated with cognitive function in healthy children and adolescents, though underweight might be a risk factor for reduced memory performance in females.

When examined in preclinical studies, a cysteine to serine substitution in the C31 dicysteine motif of the HIV-C Tat protein (C31S) results in less severe brain injury compared to other viral clades. By contrast, patient cohort studies identify significant neuropsychological impairment among HIV-C individuals independent of Tat variability. The present study clarified this discrepancy by examining neuroimaging markers of brain integrity among HIV-C individuals with and without the Tat substitution. Thirty-seven HIV-C individuals with the Tat C31S substitution, 109 HIV-C individuals without the Tat substitution (C31C), and 34 HIV- controls underwent 3T structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Volumes were determined for the caudate, putamen, thalamus, corpus callosum, total gray matter, and total white matter. DTI metrics included fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD). Tracts of interest included the anterior thalamic radiation (ATR), cingulum bundle (CING), uncinate fasciculus (UNC), and corpus callosum (CC). HIV+ individuals exhibited smaller volumes in subcortical gray matter, total gray matter and total white matter compared to HIV- controls. HIV+ individuals also exhibited DTI abnormalities across multiple tracts compared to HIV- controls. By contrast, neither volumetric nor diffusion indices differed significantly between the Tat C31S and C31C groups. Tat C31S status is not a sufficient biomarker of HIV-related brain integrity in patient populations. Clinical attention directed at brain health is warranted for all HIV+ individuals, independent of Tat C31S or clade C status.",Laur E Salminen; Gayla R Olbricht; Ryan Cabeen; David H Laidlaw; Jacqueline Hoare; Robert H Paul; Sarah Phillips; Jodi Heaps; Laurie M Baker; Soraya Seedat; Susan Engelbrecht; Dan J Stein; John Joska; Yuqing Su,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inflammation is critical in neuronal damage linked to HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders. We examined the relationship between plasma cytokine levels and deficits in neurocognitive function. Multiplex profiling by Luminex technology was used to quantify 27 cytokines/chemokines from 139 plasma samples of people living with HIV (PLWH). The relationship of plasma cytokine markers, clinical parameters, and cognitive impairment, was assessed using Spearman correlations. Partial least squares regression and variable importance in projection scores were used for further evaluation of the association. Forty-nine (35.3%) participants exhibited neurocognitive impairment based on a global deficit score (GDS) of at least 0.5 and 90 (64.7%) were classified as nonimpaired. Twenty-three (16.5%) initiated on combination antiretroviral therapy for 4 weeks before cognitive assessment and 116 (83.5%) were not on treatment. We identified five proinflammatory cytokines that were significant predictors of GDS namely, IP-10 ( = 0.058;  = .007), RANTES ( = 0.049;  = .005), IL-2 ( = 0.047,  = .006), Eotaxin ( = 0.042,  = .003), and IL-7 ( = 0.039,  = .003). IP-10 and RANTES were the strongest predictors of GDS. Both cytokines correlated with plasma viral load and lymphocyte proviral load and were inversely correlated with CD4 T cell counts. IP-10 and RANTES formed a separate cluster with highest proximity. Study findings describe novel associations among IP-10, RANTES, cognitive status, plasma viral load, and cell-associated viral load.",Shalena Naidoo; Robert H Paul; John A Joska; Graeme B Jacobs; Soraya Seedat; Vurayai Ruhanya; George Nyandoro; Susan Engelbrecht; Ric H Glashoff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The analyses also revealed two signature residues, asparagine, 24 N (31.9%), and histidine, 29H (21.3%), in individuals without neurocognitive impairment. Both codons, 24 and 29, were associated with high entropy but only codon 29 was under positive selection. The presence of signature K24 increased by 2.08 times the risk of neurocognitive impairment, 3.15 times higher proviral load, and 69% lower absolute CD4 T-cell count compared to those without the signature. The results support a linkage between HIV-1 C Tat N24K polymorphism, proviral load, immunosuppression, and neurocognitive impairment. The signature may induce more neurotoxic effects, which contributes to establishment and severity of HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment.",Susan Engelbrecht; Graeme B Jacobs; Soraya Seedat; John A Joska; George Nyandoro; Vurayai Ruhanya; Robert H Paul; Ric H Glashoff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A cross-sectional study was conducted on participants investigated for HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment in South Africa. HIV-1 proviral DNA was quantified using a PCR assay targeting a highly conserved HIV-1 LTR-gag region. Fifty-four (36.7%) participants were cognitively impaired and 93 (63.3%) were not impaired. Forty-three (79.6%) of the cognitively impaired participants were female and 11 (20.4%) were male. There was no significant age difference between cognitively impaired and unimpaired participants (p = 0.42). HIV-1 DNA in cognitively impaired PLWH was significantly higher than in cognitively normal individuals (p = .016). Considering impaired participants, lymphocyte HIV-1 DNA was significantly higher in males than females (p = 0.02). There was a modest positive correlation between lymphocyte HIV-1 DNA and global deficit scores (GDS) r = 0.176; p = 0.03). The two measures of viral load, lymphocyte HIV-1 DNA copies/million and plasma RNA copies/ml, were positively correlated (r = 0.39; p < .001). After adjusting for other covariates, age, sex, treatment status, and the interactions between impairment and treatment, the multivariate regression showed association between proviral load and neurocognitive impairment; omega effect size was 0.04, p value = 0.010. The burden of HIV-1 peripheral blood lymphocyte proviral DNA corresponds to neurocognitive impairment among individuals infected with clade C disease. Therefore, therapeutic strategies to reduce the HIV-1 proviral DNA reservoir in lymphocytes may improve neurocognitive outcomes in PLWH.",Soraya Seedat; Ric H Glashoff; Susan Engelbrecht; Vurayai Ruhanya; Graeme B Jacobs; George Nyandoro; Robert H Paul; John A Joska,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is substantial inter-individual variability in access to clinical care, prevalence of co-occurring risk factors, and comorbid health conditions that represent barriers to achieving the full potential of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Complex interactions between these variables translate into heterogeneity in HIV clinical phenotypes, including abnormalities in brain structure and function. The growing population of PLWH in HICs who are now reaching advanced age introduces additional causal pathways of neurocognitive variability among PLWH receiving ART. These patterns foreshadow trends expected to develop globally in response to increased access to ART. This chapter reviews the combination of highly dimensional risk factors for neurocognitive complications among PLWH residing in HICs. We begin with a brief description of the neuropathological, neuroimaging, and neurocognitive signatures of HIV, followed by a summary of controversies regarding the clinical presentation of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), including putative synergies between HIV disease dynamics and advanced age. Finally, we introduce innovative research strategies that have potential to advance the existing conceptual framework of HAND and, ideally, catalyze the development and of clinical interventions needed to achieve HIV treatment and eradication efforts.",Jacob Bolzenius; Julie Mannarino; Paola Garcia-Egan; Robert Paul,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This pattern may reflect transient contextual factors, including the degree of effort exerted by individuals undergoing cognitive testing. The present study examined whether effort corresponds to the expression of persistent HIV-related cognitive impairment among individuals receiving combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). HIV+ individuals (n = 111) averaged 48.2 (14.9) years of age and 13.0 (2.7) years of education and HIV- individuals (n = 92) averaged 34.9 (17.2) years of age and 13.5 (1.9) years of education. Participants completed a neuropsychological battery and a clinically validated measure of effort (Test of Memory Malingering, trial 1). Results revealed that the vast majority of HIV+ (85%) and HIV- (89%) individuals performed above published guidelines for adequate effort. Furthermore, the expression of cognitive impairment in HIV was not related to effort performance. The results were unchanged when examining HIV+ individuals with and without viral suppression. Finally, disability and disability-seeking status, and a proxy measure of apathy did not correspond to effort levels in HIV+ individuals. These findings suggest that variability in the expression of cognitive impairment in the cART era is unlikely to represent overt effort failures or other confounds unrelated to the disease.

While this field originated with techniques capable of capturing macrostructural details of brain anatomy, modern methods such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) that are now regularly implemented in research protocols have the ability to characterize brain microstructure. DTI has been used to reveal subtle micro-anatomical abnormalities in the prodromal phase ofº various diseases and also to delineate ""normal"" age-related changes in brain tissue across the lifespan. Nevertheless, imaging artifact in DTI remains a significant limitation for identifying true neural signatures of disease and brain-behavior relationships. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contamination of brain voxels is a main source of error on DTI scans that causes partial volume effects and reduces the accuracy of tissue characterization. Several methods have been proposed to correct for CSF artifact though many of these methods introduce new limitations that may preclude certain applications. The purpose of this review is to discuss the complexity of signal acquisition as it relates to CSF artifact on DTI scans and review methods of CSF suppression in DTI. We will then discuss a technique that has been recently shown to effectively suppress the CSF signal in DTI data, resulting in fewer errors and improved measurement of brain tissue. This approach and related techniques have the potential to significantly improve our understanding of ""normal"" brain aging and neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases.

The present study utilized multiple indices of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neuropsychological assessment to examine the integrity of specific white matter tracts and cognition between individuals with homozygous genotypes of M268T (MetMet n=27, ThrThr n=27). Differences in subcortical hyperintensity (SH) volume were also examined between groups. Results indicated that the threonine variant was associated with significantly reduced integrity in the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) and the cingulate gyrus segment of the cingulum bundle (cingulum CG) compared to those with the methionine variant, and poorer cognitive performance on tests of attention/processing speed and language. Despite these associations, integrity of these tracts did not significantly mediate relationships between cognition and genetic status, and SH did not differ significantly between groups.

More recently, quantitative tractography based on diffusion tensor imaging (qtDTI) technology has been developed to help quantify aggregate structural anatomical properties of white matter fiber bundles, including both scalar metrics of bundle diffusion and more complex morphometric properties, such as fiber bundle length (FBL). Unlike traditional scalar diffusion metrics, FBL reflects the direction and curvature of white matter pathways coursing through the brain and is sensitive to changes within the entire tractography model. In this paper, we discuss applications of this approach to date that have provided new insights into brain organization and function. We also discuss opportunities for improving the methodology through more complex anatomical models and potential areas of new application for qtDTI.",Laurie M Baker; Robert H Paul; Sarah Cooley; Ryan P Cabeen; David H Laidlaw,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The association between FBL metrics, measures of disease burden, and neuropsychological performance were also investigated. Results indicate significantly reduced sum of whole brain fiber bundle lengths (FBL, p < 0.001), but not average whole brain FBL in the HIV+ group compared to the HIV- controls. The HIV+ group exhibited significantly shorter sum of FBL in all six TOIs examined: the anterior thalamic radiation, cingulum bundle, inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculi, inferior frontal occipital fasciculus, and the uncinate fasciculus. Additionally, average FBLs were significantly shorter select TOIs including the inferior longitudinal fasciculus, cingulum bundle, and the anterior thalamic radiation. Shorter whole brain FBL sum metrics were associated with poorer neuropsychological performance, but were not associated with markers of disease burden.

Incompletely understood is how brain structure can serve to differentiate cognitive impairment (CI) in the HIV-positive (i.e., HAND) from the HIV-negative cohort (i.e., MCI and AD). To that end, we designed a multi-label classifier that labels the structural magnetic resonance images (MRI) of individuals by their HIV and CI status via two binary variables. Proper training of such an approach traditionally requires well-curated datasets containing large number of samples for each of the corresponding four cohorts (healthy controls, CI HIV-negative adults a.k.a. CI-only, HIV-positive patients without CI a.k.a. HIV-only, and HAND). Because of the rarity of such datasets, we proposed to improve training of the multi-label classifier via a multi-domain learning scheme that also incorporates domain-specific classifiers on auxiliary single-label datasets specific to either binary label. Specifically, we complement the training dataset of MRIs of the four cohorts (Control: 156, CI-only: 335, HIV-only: 37, HAND: 145) acquired by the Memory and Aging Center at the University of California - San Francisco with a CI-specific dataset only containing MRIs of HIV-negative subjects (Controls: 229, CI-only: 397) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and an HIV-specific dataset (Controls: 75, HIV-only: 75) provided by SRI International. Based on cross-validation on the UCSF dataset, the multi-domain and multi-label learning strategy leads to superior classification accuracy compared with one-domain or multi-class learning approaches, specifically for the undersampled HIV-only cohort. The 'prediction logits' of CI computed by the multi-label formulation also successfully stratify motor performance among the HIV-positive subjects (including HAND). Finally, brain patterns driving the subject-level predictions across all four cohorts characterize the independent and compounding effects of HIV and CI in the HAND cohort.",Qingyu Zhao; Victor Valcour; Adolf Pfefferbaum; Edith V Sullivan; Robert Paul; Kilian M Pohl; Jiequan Zhang; Ehsan Adeli,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It remains unclear whether this increase in self-reported difficulties is unique to the blast mechanism or stressful preinjury environment and whether cognitive-functioning deficits correspond with these difficulties in the postacute phase. This study examined the relationship between cognitive performance and self-reported psychological and somatic symptoms of blast-related mTBI compared with civilian mTBI, independent of comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Twelve veterans with blast-related mTBI were compared to 18 individuals with civilian mTBI on cognitive tests and self-report questionnaires. Univariate analyses failed to reveal differences on any individual cognitive test. Further, veterans reported more psychological and somatic complaints. These self-reported difficulties were not significantly correlated with neuropsychological performance. Overall, preliminary results suggest that in the postacute phase, subjective complaints related to blast-related mTBI do not covary with objective cognitive performance. Additionally, cognitive outcomes from blast-related mTBI were similar to those of civilian forms of mTBI. Future studies should identify the cognitive and self-reported sequelae of blast-related mTBI independent of comorbid PTSD in a larger sample of veterans.

Peripheral venous blood samples collected at baseline, 6 months, 12 months, and 15 months were used to measure a detectable viral load (> 40 copies/mL), the kynurenine/tryptophan (K/T) ratio, and the phenylalanine/tyrosine (P/T) ratio.

We utilized quantitative tractography metrics derived from diffusion-tensor MRI to investigate the relationship between the mean fiber bundle lengths (FBLs) projecting to different lobes, and EF/CPS performance in 73 healthy aging adults. We measured aspects of EF and CPS with the Trail Making Test (TMT), Color-Word Interference Test, Letter-Number Sequencing (L-N Seq), and Symbol Coding. Results revealed that parietal and occipital FBLs explained a significant portion of variance in EF. Frontal, temporal, and occipital FBLs explained a significant portion of variance in CPS. Shorter occipital FBLs were associated with poorer performance on the EF tests TMT-B and CWIT 3. Shorter frontal, parietal, and occipital FBLs were associated with poorer performance on L-N Seq and Symbol Coding. Shorter frontal and temporal FBLs were associated with lower performance on CPS tests TMT-A and CWIT 1. Shorter FBLs were also associated with increased age. Results suggest an age-related FBL shortening in specific brain regions related to poorer EF and CPS performance among older adults.

Our aim was to determine, in a South African cohort of PWH (N = 148), (a) how much variation in reported rates was due to method used to define cognitive impairment and (b) which method correlated best with MRI biomarkers of HIV-related brain pathology. Participants completed detailed neuropsychological assessment and underwent 3 T structural MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We used the neuropsychological data to investigate 20 different methods of determining HIV-associated cognitive impairment. We used the neuroimaging data to obtain volumes for cortical and subcortical grey matter and total white matter and DTI metrics for several white matter tracts. Applying each of the 20 methods to the cognitive dataset resulted in a wide variation (20-97%) in estimated rates of impairment. Logistic regression models showed no method was associated with HIV-related neuroimaging abnormalities as measured by structural volumes or DTI metrics. We conclude that for the population from which this sample was drawn, much of the variation in reported rates of cognitive impairment in PWH is due to the method of classification used, and that none of these methods accurately reflects biological effects of HIV in the brain.

HIV can cause neurological injury among children born with infection, but the neuroanatomical and developmental effects in HEU children are poorly understood. Methods: We used structural magnetic resonance imaging with diffusion tensor imaging to compare brain anatomy between 30 HEU and 33 age-matched HIV-unexposed and uninfected (HUU) children from Thailand. Maps of brain volume and microstructural anatomy were compared across groups; associations were tested between neuroimaging measures and concurrent neuropsychological test performance. Results: Mean (standard deviation) age of children was 10.3 (2.8) years, and 58% were male. All were enrolled in school and lived with family members. Intelligence quotient (IQ) did not differ between groups. Caretaker education levels did not differ, but income was higher for HUU (P < 0.001). We did not detect group differences in brain volume or diffusion tensor imaging metrics, after controlling for sociodemographic factors. The mean (95% confidence interval) fractional anisotropy in the corpus callosum was 0.375 (0.368-0.381) in HEU compared with 0.370 (0.364-0.375) in HUU. Higher fractional anisotropy and lower mean diffusivity were each associated with higher IQ scores in analyses with both groups combined. Conclusions: No differences in neuroanatomical or brain integrity measures were detectable in HEU children compared with age-matched and sex-matched controls (HUU children). Expected associations between brain integrity measures and IQ scores were identified suggesting sufficient power to detect subtle associations that were present.

Regardless of treatment status, an aberrant chronic neuro-immune regulation is a crucial contributor to the development of HAND. However, the extent to which inflammation affects brain structures critical for cognitive status remains unclear. The present study aimed to determine associations of peripheral immune markers with cortical thickness and surface area. Participants included 65 treatment-naïve HIV-positive individuals and 26 HIV-negative controls. Thickness and surface area of all cortical regions were derived using automated parcellation of T1-weighted images acquired at 3 T. Peripheral immune markers included C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), thymidine phosphorylase (TYMP), transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Associations of these markers with thickness and surface area of cortical regions were evaluated. A mediation analysis examined whether associations of inflammatory markers with cognitive functioning were mediated by brain cortical thickness and surface area. After controlling for multiple comparisons, higher NGAL was associated with reduced thickness of the bilateral orbitofrontal cortex in HIV-positive participants. The association of NGAL with worse motor function was mediated by cortical thickness of the bilateral orbitofrontal region. Taken together, this study suggests that NGAL plays a potential role in the neuropathophysiology of neurocognitive impairments of HIV.",Robert H Paul; Dan J Stein; Petrus J W Naudé; Jonathan C Ipser; John A Joska; Alyssa R Amod; Monray E Williams,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study is to clarify the discrepancies using a large, diverse group of HIV+ individuals and multiple imaging modalities sensitive to HIV. The association of ApoE ε4 with structural neuroimaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was examined in 237 HIV+ individuals in the CNS HIV Anti-Retroviral Therapy Effects Research (CHARTER) study. Cortical and subcortical gray matter, abnormal and total white matter, ventricles, sulcal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and cerebellar gray matter, white matter, and CSF volumes, and MRS concentrations of myo-inositol, creatine, N-acetyl-aspartate, and choline in the frontal white matter (FWM), frontal gray matter (FGM), and basal ganglia were examined. Secondary analyses explored this relationship separately in individuals ≥50 years old (n = 173) and <50 years old (n = 63). No significant differences were observed between ApoE ε4+ (ApoE ε3/ε4 and ApoE ε4/ε4) individuals (n = 69) and ApoE ε4- (ApoE ε2/ε3 and ApoE ε3/ε3) individuals (n = 167). When individuals were further divided by age, no significant genotype group differences were identified in individuals <50 or ≥50 years of age on any neuroimaging outcome. The ApoE ε4 allele did not affect brain integrity in this large, diverse sample of HIV+ individuals. The effects of ApoE ε4 may not be apparent until more advanced ages and may be more prominent when present along with other risk factors for neuronal damage.",David M Simpson; Christine Fennema-Notestine; Christina M Marra; David B Clifford; Robert H Paul; S A Cooley; CNS HIV Anti-Retroviral Therapy Effects Research (CHARTER) Group ; Susan Morgello; Qianqian Deng; Igor Grant; Jie A Chen; Beau M Ances; Florin Vaida; Ann C Collier; Scott Letendre; Benjamin B B Gelman; Ronald Ellis; Erin E E Morgan; Justin C McArthur; J A McCutchan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To facilitate discussion on emerging and future directions in HAND research, a meeting was held in Durban, South Africa in March 2015 as part of the Society of Neuroscientists of Africa (SONA) conference. The objective of the meeting was to assess the impact of HIV subtype diversity on HAND and immunological dysfunction. The meeting brought together international leaders in the area of neurological complications of HIV-1 infection with special focus on the African population. Research presentations indicated that HAND was highly prevalent and that inflammatory cytokines and immune-activation played important roles in progression of neurocognitive impairment. Furthermore, children on antiretroviral therapy were also at risk for developing neurocognitive impairment. With respect to the effect of HIV-1 subtype diversity, analyses of HIV-1 clade C infection among South Africans revealed that clade C infection induced cognitive impairment that was independent of the substitution in HIV-1 Trans-Activator of Transcription (Tat; C31S). At the cellular level, a Zambian study showed that clade C infection resulted in reduced brain cell death compared with clade B infection suggesting clade specific variations in mediating brain cell injury. Furthermore, ex vivo Tat protein from clade CRF02_AG, prevalent in West/ Central Africa, exhibited reduced disruption of brain endothelium compared with clade B Tat protein. Discussions shed light on future research directions aimed at understanding biomarkers and disease mechanisms critical for HAND.",Ernes T Chivero; Jackie Hoare; Robert Paul; Victor Mudenda; Noeline Nakasujja; Shilpa Buch; Jibreel Jumare; Charles Wood; Ned Sacktor; Georgette D Kanmogne; Walter Royal; Jeymohan Joseph,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to evaluate plasma cytokine levels as predictor neurocognitive impairment in HIV infection using a multiplex profiling kit. Stepwise regression model was used to identify cytokine biomarkers of overall and domain-specific cognitive performance. Higher interleukin (IL)-2 ( = 0.04;  = 0.001) and eotaxin ( = 0.01;  = 0.017) were predictors of global neurocognitive, whereas higher IL-5 ( = 0.005;  = 0.007) was negative predictor of global cognitive deficit. IL-2 was a negative predictor of most cognitive domain functions, including recall ( = 0.24;  = 0.005), recognition ( = 0.04;  = 0.026), mental control ( = 0.38;  = 0.005), symbol search ( = -0.55;  = 0.001), and digital symbol ( = -0.79;  = 0.019). IL-6 was associated with 3 impaired domains, mental processing ( = -0.468;  = 0.027), recognition ( = -0.044;  = 0.012), and learning ( = 0.02668;  = 0.020) These results show that plasma cytokines/chemokines may serve as markers of neurocognitive impairment in HIV infection.",Soraya Seedat; Vurayai Ruhanya; Graeme B Jacobs; Robert Paul; John Joska; George Nyandoro; Susan Engelbrecht; Ric H Glashoff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: 388 people with HIV (PWH) with an average age of 46 (15.8) and median plasma CD4+ T-cell count of 555 copies/mL (79% virally suppressed) underwent cognitive testing and 3T neuroimaging. Demographics, HIV disease variables, and health comorbidities were recorded within three months of cognitive testing/neuroimaging. Hierarchical clustering was employed to identify cognitive phenotypes followed by ensemble machine learning to delineate the features that determined membership in the cognitive phenotypes. Hierarchical clustering identified five cognitive phenotypes. Cluster 1 (n=97) was comprised of individuals with normative performance on all cognitive tests. The remaining clusters were defined by impairment on action fluency (Cluster 2; n=46); verbal learning/memory (Cluster 3; n=73); action fluency and verbal learning/memory (Cluster 4; n=56); and action fluency, verbal learning/memory, and tests of executive function (Cluster 5; n=114). HIV detectability was most common in Cluster 5. Machine learning revealed that polysubstance use, race, educational attainment, and volumes of the precuneus, cingulate, nucleus accumbens, and thalamus differentiated membership in the normal vs. impaired clusters. The determinants of persistent cognitive impairment among PWH receiving suppressive treatment are multifactorial nature. Viral replication after ART plays a role in the causal pathway, but psychosocial factors (race inequities, substance use) merit increased attention as critical determinants of cognitive impairment in the context of ART. Results underscore the need for comprehensive person-centered interventions that go beyond adherence to patient care to achieve optimal cognitive health among PWH.",Beau M Ances; Jacob Bolzenius; Patrick Luckett; S A Cooley; Julie Mannarino; Eileen Martin; Jodi M Gilman; Adam W Carrico; Andrew Belden; Kyu Cho; Robert H Paul; Mariah Miano,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study examined CR as a potential moderator of cognitive performance and brain integrity as defined by FBL. Sixty-three healthy adults underwent neuropsychological evaluation and 3T brain magnetic resonance imaging. Cognitive performance was measured using the Repeatable Battery of Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). FBL was quantified from tractography tracings of white matter fiber bundles, derived from the diffusion tensor imaging. CR was determined by estimated premorbid IQ. Analyses revealed that lower scores on the RBANS were associated with shorter whole brain FBL (p = 0.04) and lower CR (p = 0.01) CR moderated the relationship between whole brain FBL and RBANS score (p < 0.01). Tract-specific analyses revealed that CR also moderated the association between FBL in the hippocampal segment of the cingulum and RBANS performance (p = 0.03). These results demonstrate that lower cognitive performance on the RBANS is more common with low CR and short FBL.

It remains uncertain whether HAART regimens with a high degree of central nervous system penetration effectiveness (CPE) exert beneficial neurological outcomes in HIV-infected (HIV+) individuals on stable treatment. Sixty-four HIV-infected adults on HAART were assigned a CPE score using a published ranking system and divided into high (≥7; n = 35) and low (<7; n = 29) CPE groups. All participants completed neuropsychological testing in addition to structural neuroimaging. Neuropsychological tests included measures known to be sensitive to HIV with values converted into standardized scores (NPZ-4) based on published normative scores. A semi-automated methodology was utilized to assess brain volumetrics within cortical (grey and white matter) and subcortical (thalamus, caudate, putamen) regions of interest. Analyses assessed NPZ-4 and brain volumetric differences between HIV+ individuals with high and low CPE scores. No significant differences in brain integrity were observed between the two groups. Long-term HAART regimens with a high degree of CPE were not associated with significantly improved neuropsychological or neuroimaging outcomes in HIV+ adults.

HIV+ participants and demographically similar HIV- controls (n = 16) residing in South Africa underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neuropsychological testing. Structural network models were constructed using diffusion MRI-based multifiber tractography and T-weighted MRI-based regional gray matter segmentation. Global network measures included whole-brain structural integration, connection strength, and structural segregation. Cognition was measured using a neuropsychological global deficit score (GDS) as well as individual cognitive domains. Results revealed that HIV+ participants exhibited significant disruptions to whole-brain networks, characterized by weaker structural integration (characteristic path length and efficiency), connection strength, and structural segregation (clustering coefficient) than HIV- controls (p < 0.05). GDSs and performance on learning/recall tasks were negatively correlated with the clustering coefficient (p < 0.05) in HIV+ participants. Results from this study indicate disruption to brain network integrity in treatment-limited HIV+ young adults with corresponding abnormalities in cognitive performance.",Ryan P Cabeen; S A Cooley; Laurie M Baker; David H Laidlaw; John A Joska; Jacqueline Hoare; Dan J Stein; Jodi M Heaps-Woodruff; Laur E Salminen; Robert H Paul,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Robert,Paul,(R) Structural and functional brain imaging in acute HIV,Neuroimage-Clinical,7/27/2018,2018.0,20,327-335,,,Completed/Published,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2018.07.024,30101063,PMC6082997,,Summer,2018,"Background: HIV RNA is identified in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within eight days of estimated viral exposure. Neurological findings and impaired neuropsychological testing performance are documented in a subset of individuals with acute HIV infection (AHI). The purpose of this study was to determine whether microstructural white matter and resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) are disrupted in AHI.

Methods: We examined 49 AHI (100% male; mean age = 30 ± SD 9.9) and 23 HIV-uninfected Thai participants (78% male; age = 30 ± 5.5) with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and rsFC acquired at 3 Tesla, and four neuropsychological tests (summarized as NPZ-4). MRI for the AHI group was performed prior to combination antiretroviral treatment (ART) in 26 participants and on average two days (range:1–5) after ART in 23 participants. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean (MD), axial (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were quantified for DTI. Seed-based voxelwise rsFC analyses were completed for the default mode (DMN), fronto-parietal, and salience and 6 subcortical networks. rsFC and DTI analyses were corrected for family-wise error, with voxelwise comparisons completed using t-tests. Group-specific voxelwise regressions were conducted to examine relationships between imaging indices, HIV disease variables, and treatment status.

Results: The AHI group had a mean (SD) CD4 count of 421(234) cells/mm3 plasma HIV RNA of 6.07(1.1) log10 copies/mL and estimated duration of infection of 20(5.5) days. Differences between AHI and CO groups did not meet statistical significance for DTI metrics. Within the AHI group, voxelwise analyses revealed associations between brief exposure to ART and higher FA and lower RD and MD bilaterally in the corpus callosum, corona radiata, and superior longitudinal fasciculus (p < 0.05). Diffusion indices were unrelated to clinical variables or NPZ-4. The AHI group had reduced rsFC between left parahippocampal cortex (PHC) of the DMN and left middle frontal gyrus compared to CO (p < 0.002). Within AHI, ART status was unrelated to rsFC. However, higher CD4 cell count associated with increased rsFC for the right lateral parietal and PHC seeds in the DMN. Direct associations were noted between NPZ-4 correspond to higher rsFC of the bilateral caudate seed (p < 0.002).

Conclusions: Study findings reveal minimal disruption to structural and functional brain integrity in the earliest stages of HIV. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine if treatment with ART initiated in AHI is sufficient to prevent the evolution of brain dysfunction identified in chronically infected individuals.

Polymorphisms in the superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) and catalase (CAT) genes have been associated with abnormalities in antioxidant enzyme activity in the aging brain, suggesting a risk for enhanced oxidative damage to white matter and cognition among older individuals with these genetic variants. The present study compared differences in white matter microstructure and cognition among 96 older adults with and without genetic risk factors of SOD2 (rs4880) and CAT (rs1001179). Results revealed higher radial diffusivity in the anterior thalamic radiation among SOD2 CC genotypes compared to CT/TT genotypes. Further, the CC genotype moderated the relationship between the hippocampal cingulum and processing speed, though this did not survive multiple test correction. The CAT polymorphism was not associated with brain outcomes in this cohort. These results suggest that the CC genotype of SOD2 is an important genetic marker of suboptimal brain aging in healthy individuals.",Ryan P Cabeen; Robert H Paul; Jacob D Bolzenius; Thomas E Conturo; David H Laidlaw; David F Tate; Michael G Griffin; St E Bruce; Kerrie D Pierce; Pete R Schofield; Laur E Salminen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While previous studies have established age-related changes in white matter (WM) diffusion using DTI, the impact of age on gray matter (GM) diffusion remains unclear. The present study utilized DTI metrics of mean diffusivity (MD) to identify age differences in GM/WM microstructure in a sample of healthy older adults (N = 60). A secondary aim was to determine the functional significance of whole-brain GM/WM MD on global cognitive function using the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). Participants were divided into three age brackets (ages 50-59, 60-69, and 70+) to examine differences in MD and cognition by decade. MD was examined bilaterally in the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes for the primary analyses and an aggregate measure of whole-brain MD was used to test relationships with cognition. Significantly higher MD was observed in bilateral GM of the temporal and parietal lobes, and in right hemisphere WM of the frontal and temporal lobes of older individuals. The most robust differences in MD were between the 50-59 and 70+ age groups. Higher whole-brain GM MD was associated with poorer RBANS performance in the 60-69 age group. Results suggest that aging has a significant and differential impact on GM/WM diffusion in healthy older adults, which may explain a modest degree of cognitive variability at specific time points during older adulthood.",Jacob D Bolzenius; David H Laidlaw; Thomas E Conturo; Laur E Salminen; Ryan P Cabeen; Erbil Akbudak; Lee M Cagle; Staci Scott; Sarah Cooley; Laurie M Baker; Elizabeth M Lane; Jodi M Heaps; Robert H Paul; Sarah Phillips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The majority of studies have focused on structural or functional brain outcomes in samples infected with clade B HIV. While preliminary work reveals a similar structural imaging phenotype in patients infected with clade C HIV, no study has examined functional connectivity (FC) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) in clade C HIV. In particular, we were interested to explore HIV-only effects on neurocognitive function using associations with rs-fMRI. In the present study, 56 treatment-naïve, clade C HIV-infected participants (age 32.27 ± 5.53 years, education 10.02 ± 1.72 years, 46 female) underwent rs-fMRI and cognitive testing. Individual resting-state networks were correlated with global deficit scores (GDS) in order to explore associations between them within an HIV-positive sample. Results revealed ten regions in six resting-state networks where FC inversely correlated with GDS scores (worse performance). The networks affected included three independent attention networks: the default mode network (DMN), sensorimotor network, and basal ganglia. Connectivity in these regions did not correlate with plasma viral load or CD4 cell count. The design of this study is unique and has not been previously reported in clade B. The abnormalities related to neurocognitive performance reported in this study of clade C may reflect late disease stage and/or unique host/viral dynamics. Longitudinal studies will help to clarify the clinical significance of resting-state alterations in clade C HIV.",Jackie Hoare; Robert H Paul; Dan J Stein; John A Joska; Ernesta M Meintjes; P A Taylor; Lindie du Plessis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we examined how soon after infection HIV-associated epigenetic changes may occur in blood and whether early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) impacts epigenetic modifications. We profiled longitudinal genome-wide DNA methylation in monocytes and CD4+ T lymphocytes from 22 participants in the RV254/SEARCH010 acute HIV infection (AHI) cohort that diagnoses infection within weeks after estimated exposure and immediately initiates ART. We identified monocytes harbored 22,697 differentially methylated CpGs associated with AHI compared to 294 in CD4+ T lymphocytes. ART minimally restored less than 1% of these changes in monocytes and had no effect upon T cells. Monocyte DNA methylation patterns associated with viral load, CD4 count, CD4/CD8 ratio, and longitudinal clinical phenotypes.

Paternalism in the context of leadership reflects a hierarchical relationship and is based on the assumption of power inequality. The current body of research on PL is fragmented, with research emerging from an array of different cultural contexts. While cross-cultural research interest provides an inclusive cultural base for theoretical development, it has also led to a lack of conceptual clarity, insufficient delineation of research paradigms, and inconsistent results. In the extant PL literature, two broad conceptualizations can be identified. First, there is theoretical and empirical research disseminating from Turkey, which defines PL as a hierarchical relationship in which the leader guides employees in their professional and personal lives, in a manner resembling a parent, and in return expects loyalty and deference. This definition refers to PL as a construct comprised of benevolent and authoritative leadership, common in the Middle East. Second, there is a more authoritarian definition emerging from China which suggests a configural approach and refers to PL as a combination of authoritarian, benevolent, and moral leadership.

Taking insights from institutional theory, it proposes that the relationship between the sustainability determinants and the level of sustainability initiatives is mediated by coercive, mimetic and normative isomorphic pressures. Moreover, it suggests that culture plays a significant role in moderating the extent to which the various types of isomorphic pressure on firms may influence the levels of firms’ sustainability initiatives. The implications of the framework are discussed in the light of encouraging sustainability initiatives and overall sustainable development in various cultural settings as well as undertaking future research to enhance the framework and its applicability.",Bindu Arya (Role:Author); Sven Horak (Role:Author); Kiran M Ismail (Role:Author),Yes,Basic or Discovery Scholarship,Blind Peer Reviewed,International,None,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Co-author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,11.0

Using a sample of historically disadvantaged individuals from South Africa, our results show that organizational justice perceptions fully mediate the relationship between core self-evaluations and pay satisfaction.

Prior research has found positive associations between self-leadership and a variety of individual and organizational outcomes. Yet, very little work has investigated the role of personality traits as possible antecedents of self-leadership. Hence, the primary goal of our study is to investigate several of these antecedents in a non-Western context with the goal of further clarifying this valuable topic. We also test whether this relationship is mediated by thriving at work and moderated by proactive personality. Data was collected in two time waves to minimize common method bias from 245 employees working in different public and private sector firms by utilizing survey methodology.

We find evidence that taking the mosaic view of culture and making subjects aware of shared affective ties, based on age, educational-institution and regional origin, leads to differences in economic decisions, contrary to what neoclassical economic theory would suggest. Our results indicate that awareness of common group membership in some cultural contexts orients decision-makers towards upholding social norms that induces a greater preference for more selfless, in-group interested decisions, while anonymity makes personal identity salient and promotes more self-interested economic decisions.

The purpose of this paper is to draw on social exchange theory arguments to investigate the direct and indirect effects of internal and external CSR practices on employee organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) and intention to quit. Design/methodology/approach: An empirical study was conducted among 664 employees working in the banking sector in Kuwait. Structural equation modeling techniques were used to test the suggested hypotheses. Findings: The results reveal that both internal and external CSR activities are positively related to OCB and OCB is negatively associated with intention to quit. Results also show that distributive justice moderates the relationship between OCB and intention to quit. Practical implications: These findings extend the literature on CSR and demonstrate that organizations engaged in CSR activities (internal and external) can enhance citizenship behaviors among employees and thereby increase retention rates. Originality/value: This research demonstrates the importance of CSR activities in tax-free countries, particularly, in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. Since employees in GCC countries are increasingly concerned about the CSR behaviors of organizations, CSR activities can allow local organizations to signal that they are good corporate citizens.

We then show that this generalized Kummer variety is equipped with two fibrations with general fiber of genus 2r−1. When periods of a holomorphic two-form over carefully crafted transcendental two-cycles on the generalized Kummer variety are evaluated using either of the two fibrations, the answer must be independent of the fibration and the aforementioned family of special function identities is obtained.

Ferrocenium cations have been employed as catalysts in a number of organic transformations, and we investigated the stability of a number of ferrocenium salts in solution. The observed rate decomposition constants for [Fc]Cl, [Fc]PF6, [Fc]BF4, [Fc]CSA [Fc = ferrocenium, CSA = camphor-10-sulfonate (β)], [AcFc]SbF6, (AcFc = acetylated ferrocene), and [FcB(OH)2]SbF6 [FcB(OH)2 = ferrocenylboronic acid] were determined in CH2Cl2 solution by time-resolved UV-vis spectroscopy. The rate decomposition constants depended on the nature of the counterion, with [Fc]Cl being the most stable complex in solution. The decomposition rate constants dropped by roughly an order of magnitude in most cases when the experiments were performed in nitrogenated solvent, demonstrating that the decomposition is mainly an oxidative process. The cosolvent HFIP (1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoropropan-2-ol) slowed the decomposition of the ferrocenium cations as well. Many catalytic or stoichiometric reactions of ferrocenium cations are performed with alcohols; we determined that hexan-1-ol is decomposed over the course of 16 hours, but not oxidized in the presence of a ferrocenium cation. Finally, the different ferrocenium cations were employed in a test reaction to determine catalytic activity. The nucleophilic substitution of hydroxyl groups in a tertiary propargylic alcohol by an alcohol is catalyzed by all complexes, and, again, a counterion dependency of the catalytic activity was observed. Also, HFIP increases the catalytic activity of the ferrocenium cations. The research has importance in the development of ferrocenium-based catalyst systems, because changes in the counterion as well as the architecture of the ferrocenium cation have an influence on stability and catalytic activity.

Carbohydrates are also used as vaccines and pharmaceuticals. Their synthesis through glycosylation reactions is challenging, and often stoichiometric amounts of promoters are required. Transition metal catalyzed glycosylation reactions are far less common, but can have advantages with respect to reaction conditions and selectivity. The review intends to approach the topic from the catalysis and carbohydrate perspective to encourage 
 researchers from both the fields to perform research in the area. The article covers the basics in glycosylation and catalysis chemistry. The catalysts for the reaction can be roughly divided into two groups. In one group, the catalysts
serve as Lewis acids. In the other group, the catalysts play a higher sophisticated role, are involved in all elementary steps of the mechanism and remain coordinated to the substrate throughout the whole catalytic cycle. Based on selected examples, the main trends in transition metal catalyzed glycosylation reactions are explained. Lewis acid catalysts tend to require a somewhat higher catalyst load compared to other organometallic catalysts. The reaction conditions such as the temperature and time depend in many cases on the leaving group employed. An outlook is also presented. The article is not meant to be comprehensive; it outlines the most common transition metal catalyzed processes with the intention to bring the catalysis and carbohydrate communities together and to inspire research activities in both areas.

A number of iron complexes are known to catalyze the oxidation of organic substrates utilizing peroxides as the oxidant. Their development is complicated by a lack of direct comparison of the reactivities of the iron complexes. To begin to correlate reactivity with structural elements, we compare the reactivities of a series of iron pyridyl complexes toward a single dye substrate, malachite green (MG), for which colorless oxidation products are established. Complexes with tetradentate, nitrogen-based ligands with cis open coordination sites were found to be the most reactive. While some complexes reflect sensitivity to different peroxides, others are similarly reactive with either H2O2 or tBuOOH, which suggests some mechanistic distinctions. [Fe(S,S-PDP)(CH3CN)2](SbF6)2 and [Fe(OTf)2(tpa)] transition under the oxidative reaction conditions to a single intermediate at a rate that exceeds dye degradation (PDP = bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl) bipyrrolidine; tpa = tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine). For the less reactive [Fe(OTf)2(dpa)] (dpa = dipicolylamine), this reaction occurs on a timescale similar to that of MG oxidation. Thus, the spectroscopic method presented herein provides information about the efficiency and mechanism of iron catalyzed oxidation reactions as well as about potential oxidative catalyst decomposition and chemical changes of the catalyst before or during the oxidation reaction.

The scale was originally designed for written narratives, and many studies now use this scale for audio-visual (AV) stimuli, under the assumption that the scale performs the same across the different mediums. We explore if the scale does in fact perform the same in relation to written versus audio-visual narratives. In Study 1, 125 participants are exposed to one of two versions (print or video) of the same narrative. A confirmatory factor analysis indicates that the scale is not unidimensional and the factor structure is not consistent between print and video formats. Follow-up questions show that those participants who viewed the film version were puzzled by items in the scale that asked about their ability to imagine what they had seen. A new 6-item short form of the scale was also tested. Measurement invariance across the print and video groups was not supported.

These trust variables, in turn, are positively associated with the outcome variable of vaccine acceptance. A multi-group structural equation modeling analysis of survey data from 1008 U.S. adults suggested that trust in institutions and physicians were important for both White and Black Americans in whether they were vaccine-accepting or hesitant, while trust in non-discrimination was important for Black Americans and trust in social media was important for White Americans.

Results indicate that a large number of barriers to donation still exist within the African American community, including lack of knowledge, myths about donation, and mistrust of the medical community. Potential strategies to increase donors included educational campaigns, testimonials, statistical messages, and community involvement. Future directions for campaigns are explored.

The effect on root structure and growth depends both on the amino acids in the heptapeptide chain and the twin C- and N-terminal anchor chains. In some, but not all, cases a correlation to ion transport activity was apparent.Pore formation in soybean asolectin membranes occurred readily and the pores were stable and sustained. The transporter-mediated alterations in lateral root density were suggestive of the activity of plant auxins such as indole-3-acetic acid and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, which are known to depend on cytosolic potassium ion concentrations. The hypothesis that the compounds interfere with the auxin pathway was discounted by using auxin-resistant A. thaliana mutants. Rather than functioning directly as auxin mimics, ionophores affect the ion gradients producing an auxin-like effect on root development.",Sergey Sedinkin; Evan G Garrad; Mohit B Patel; George William Gokel Jr; Michael R Gokel; Sephen Korb; Saeedeh Negin,Yes,,Blind Peer Reviewed,International,Research Board,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Lead / Corresponding author,NSF,,,,English,,Self-reported,

A key property of new antimicrobials is the inability of bacteria to develop resistance to them, ensuring longer clinical use (teixobactin and malacidin). We report a new approach for developing non-resistant antimicrobials and adjuvants – synthetic ionophores. Most of the studies involving amphiphilic antimicrobials have been focused on either developing synthetic amphiphiles that show ion transport, or developing non-cytotoxic analogues of such peptidic amphiphiles as colsitin. We have rationally designed, synthesized and previously reported crown ether-based synthetic ionophores (‘hydraphiles’) that show selective ion transport through bilayer membranes and exhibit antimicrobial properties. Here, we report the in-depth antimicrobial analysis of hydraphiles and its function as antimicrobial adjuvants against multi-drug resistant bacteria.

We highlight the insights and limitations of a popular strategy in feminist research that conceptualizes gender as performance commonly referred to as ""doing gender"" using illustrations from our research. We encourage scholars to move beyond a primarily normative orientation in studying gender, and investigate gendered organizational features of social life including their intersections with other aspects of social inequality such as those of race, class, and place. In addition, we suggest that feminist scholars can integrate gender in a rigorous way into theoretical perspectives that are typically inattentive to its import, as a means of challenging, enriching, and refining research on drug use, drug users, and drug market participation.

Research has shown that managers often feel anxiety when conducting employee appraisals and consequently may withhold negative feedback, compromising the appraisal process. We examined, using Grounded Theory, the manager's experience of performance appraisal anxiety with 13 experienced managers. We found that a primary cause of PA anxiety was the fear that the employee would react negatively to the feedback. Further, our participants described productive levers they use to reduce PA anxiety while preserving the integrity of the feedback provided. PA anxiety was reduced by implementing more frequent feedback, discussions and providing training to increase manager confidence in delivering feedback effectively, and adoption of  using an employee-centered approach to PA.

Stephanie,Merritt,"To Escape the Pain: Paths to Voluntary Turnover, Social Pain, and Influences on the Selection of a New Job Role",Journal of Organizational Behavior,,2022.0,,,,,Revise & Resubmit,,,,,Spring,2023,"The unfolding model established that there is no “one size fits all” experience of voluntary turnover. Anecdotal evidence suggests that turnover experiences may be painful for some individuals, but social pain (as distinct from dissatisfaction) in turnover and subsequent job selection has not yet received much academic attention. Because people use pain-related language to describe social pain, pain can be identified through linguistic analysis. We present a re-analysis of a set of 13 detailed case histories from U.S. individuals who had recently quit one organization and entered another. Sentiment analysis revealed that respondents who had quit via the more gradual turnover paths (4a and 4b) experienced more social pain on average. Additionally, cluster analysis of the terms used to describe reasons for leaving and aspects of the job search suggested that experiencing more social pain in the prior role affected the weighting of factors when selecting a new role. Finally, higher social pain was linked with lower positive sentiment (hope, excitement, joy, etc.) during the job search process. The results imply that social pain may have implications for turnover, retention, and employees’ post-turnover destinations – bringing a novel perspective to the study of turnover.

However, when organizational performance was decreasing, leaders with higher body fat were penalized significantly more severely in terms of prototypicality ratings and effectiveness perceptions. Supplemental analyses indicated that participants attributed the organizational failure significantly more to the leader with higher body fat than to the leader with lower body fat. Collapsing across conditions, the woman leader was rated as slightly, but significantly, more prototypical than the man leader, and no interactions with gender were observed. Overall, results suggest that external observers seem to exhibit weight-based biases against leaders when other information seems to justify doing so. These observers may be unaware of their biases, believing their evaluations to be grounded in performance-based information.

Several similarities were found, as well as several differences – for example, trust and liking were significantly more strongly correlated for machines than for humans. The results suggest that while several similarities exist in trust in humans versus machines, important differences exist and therefore, theories of trust in humans cannot be directly applied to trust in machines.

In this article, we review what is currently known about 2 areas relevant to safe mobility for older drivers and identify future research in these areas. Using a framework for transportation and safe mobility, 2 key areas were selected for review: the process of transitioning to non-driving and the maintenance of mobility after driving has ceased. This article serves as a companion to another article that used the same approach to explore safe mobility issues for older adults who are still driving. We found that although there has been progress in supporting transitioning process to non-driving and improving mobility options for older adults following driving cessation, many knowledge gaps still exist. We identified several research topics that would benefit from continued scientific inquiry. In addition, several themes emerged from the review, including the need for: multidisciplinary, community-wide solutions; large-scale, longitudinal studies; improved education and training for older adults and the variety of stakeholders involved in older adult transportation; and the need for programs and interventions that are flexible and responsive to individual needs and situational differences.",David W Eby; Ann E Dickerson; Michel Bédard; Melissa O'Connor; Marla Berg-Weger; Lisa J Molnar; Anita Myers; Amy Horowitz; Thomas Meuser; Moon Choi; Jenai Grigg; Nina M Silverstein,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,International,None,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Co-author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

This study examined the utility of the Enright Forgiveness Inventory (EFI) within a sample of caregiving wives. Our intent was to better understand this population's experience with forgiveness when other contextual factors were likely to influence this process. Forgiveness scores on the EFI were positively related to the cognitive status of the care recipient, a particularly important finding for clinical intervention, and inversely related to marital distress and state anxiety.",Ann M Steffen; Laure N DeCaporale-Ryan; Tho M Meuser; Samuel J Marwit,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,National,None,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Co-author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

This work validates and expands on a 2005 typology of legacy beliefs from gerontologists, Elizabeth Hunter and Graham Rowles. A structured interview was administered separately to parents and children, coded for legacy examples (i.e., those unique to the parent, overlapping, unique to the child), and analyzed with respect to expectations of similarity reported by each participant. Most predicted moderate to high overlap in mutual understanding of parent legacy. This was not the case, as there were far more unique legacy examples given than shared. Pairs agreed least with respect to material legacies, with half showing no agreement. All reported finding the structured discussion of legacy to be beneficial, with some indicating an intention to continue these discussions further.

Significant health events may polarize reactions towards mobility transition. Individualizing communication about driving cessation readiness could help address such differing views.

Although some have raised concerns that people with prior police-related experiences are less likely to have their victimizations cleared by the police (i.e., end in an arrest of charges), few quantitative studies have examined this issue or disentangled the mechanisms linking police contact to case outcomes. Using two national longitudinal datasets, the National Crime Victimization Survey and Police Public Contact Survey, we assess the relationship between victims’ police-related experiences and their reports of whether their case was cleared, as well as two mechanisms that could be driving any observed association—police investigatory effort and whether the victim filed a complaint. We find prior police contact is related to complaint filing and case clearance, but not investigatory effort. However, the association between police-related experiences and case clearance is not mediated by our measures of investigatory effort or complaint signing. By examining victim self-report data, disentangling police behavior from victim behavior, and viewing the victim-offender overlap as an important indicator of criminal justice attention, this study adds to our understanding of who gets access to justice and why.</em></p>",Lee A Slocum; Paige Vaughn,,,,,Research Board,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Limited attention, however, has been given to potential contingencies in this relationship. The aim of this research is to extend previous school-based studies by examining whether and to what extent school context is differentially predictive of violent delinquency for immigrant and nonimmigrant youth. Using two waves of data from two multicity program evaluations, Teens, Crime, and the Community/Community Works (T.C.C./C.W.) and the Gang Resistance Education and Training (G.R.E.A.T.) program, we assess the impact of four measures of school climate on violent delinquency. Results highlight important contingencies in the relationship between immigrant status and violence.

Moreover, when victims do report, they often are dissatisfied with police response. The contextual factors influencing ones decision to invoke the law are important and have been widely examined. However, relatively little research examines (1) how the victims criminality affects this decision and (2) women offenders characterization of the factors that influenced their reporting decisions. We use data from the Womens Experiences of Violence project, and mixed methods, to explore the factors that are related to an offenders decision to report sexual victimization to police. We also consider womens descriptions of police response in those incidents where they do, in fact, report the crime. Our findings provide further insight into the complex and gendered relations between offenders and law enforcement.

We draw on prospect theory and the loss aversion principle, which suggests people are more sensitive to losses than gains (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979), to assess how individuals contend with transitions in employment and income. We analyze data from the Second Nebraska Inmate Study (Horney, 2001), which provides 36 months of retrospective information for a sample of incarcerated males, using fixed effects and asymmetrical fixed effects models. First, we assess whether job losses are more likely to generate financial stress than job gains are to alleviate such feelings, finding support for the loss aversion principle. Second, we explore how people might compensate for changes in job and income status by engaging in risk-taking behaviors (illegal earnings, gun carrying and offending versatility). We find the positive effect of job and income loss on the probability of reporting illegal earnings and crime versatility is stronger than the negative relationship between job and income gain and these behaviors. However, financial stress does not attenuate the relationship between losses and risk-taking behaviors.  We discuss the implications for theory and policy.</p>",Holly Nguyen (Role:Author); Lee A Slocum (Role:Author),,,,,Research Board,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

However, the extent that political skill is distinct from related variables in this area remains an important question. The current study examined the proportion of variance explained by political skill in job satisfaction and turnover intentions above and beyond other social effectiveness variables (i.e., social intelligence, emotional intelligence, agreeableness, and conscientiousness). Results indicated that political skill was the strongest predictor of these outcomes, and explained a significant proportion of variance in them, beyond the other four social effectiveness constructs.

A review of the literature suggests that gentrification in older industrial cities will look different in systematic ways from gentrification in global, magnet cities that most research has focused on. The literature also suggests that the political and institutional differences in cities located in different national contexts can shape gentrification processes. Our research shows that Dortmund and St. Louis are both undergoing deep processes of economic restructuring with new knowledge workers moving in to neighborhoods adjacent to expanding tech clusters. The speed and magnitude of gentrification, however, is significantly less than reported in strong market cities. Unlike in hot market, global cities, many areas within Dortmund and St. Louis are experiencing little or no gentrification, and the neighborhoods that are experiencing gentrification-like processes vary significantly along important dimensions. Despite important differences in political institutions, the basic pattern of gentrification in St. Louis and Dortmund is similar. In these two older industrial cities, at least, gentrification is a complex and variegated phenomenon that requires more research to be fully understood.",Todd Frederick Swanstrom; Joerg Ploeger (Role:Author),,,Blind Peer Reviewed,International,None,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Co-author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

The scale was originally designed for written narratives, and many studies now use this scale for audio-visual (AV) stimuli, under the assumption that the scale performs the same across the different mediums. We explore if the scale does in fact perform the same in relation to written versus audio-visual narratives. In Study 1, 125 participants are exposed to one of two versions (print or video) of the same narrative. A confirmatory factor analysis indicates that the scale is not unidimensional and the factor structure is not consistent between print and video formats. Follow-up questions show that those participants who viewed the film version were puzzled by items in the scale that asked about their ability to imagine what they had seen. A new 6-item short form of the scale was also tested. Measurement invariance across the print and video groups was not supported. Citation: Riggs, E. E., & Knobloch-Westerwick, S. (2022).

Haitao,Li,Optimizing the Labor Strategy of a Professional Service Firm,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,,2018.0,,,,,Completed/Published,,,,,Spring,2018,"A professional service firm often faces challenges in matching its available workforce with the demands for service delivery. In this paper, we coin the labor strategy optimization (LSO) problem to prescribe an optimal staffing plan for meeting the target revenues of a professional service firm. It simultaneously optimizes the capacity, capability, location, and flexibility of a firm's workforce at the strategic level. Our modeling framework captures the richness and complexity of a general service transformation process. Mathematical programming based models are developed for both the deterministic and stochastic versions of the problem. A prototype of the LSO technology was implemented at the former HP Consulting & Integration organization. Through a comprehensive computational study, managerial insights are drawn and discussed about the optimal labor strategy under various supply-side risks and uncertainties. The optimal labor strategy provides a cost effective and reliable basis for more detailed workforce optimization concerning scheduling and assignment decisions. Our study also offers a data-driven approach to take advantage of large amount of disparate data, from different organizations and geographical locations of a firm, for improving the workforce planning decisions.

As products in MTO are often unique and customized, the associated learning curve slope and other production parameters cannot be precisely estimated before production starts. In this paper, a dynamic and adaptive approach is developed to estimate the effects of learning and to optimize production rate. This approach offers a closed-loop solution through stochastic dynamic programming. Monthly production data are used to update the joint probability distributions of production parameters via Bayesian methods. Our approach is illustrated using historical data from the Black Hawk Helicopter Program. Managerial insights are obtained and discussed.

Our model maximizes the probability of meeting a pre-defined target return by selecting a feasible set of projects subject to budget constraints in multiple time periods. We employ a mixed-integer nonlinear algorithm recently developed in the optimization field to solve the
resulting non-convex optimization problem to optimality. Our model and solution methods are tested and validated through a comprehensive computational experiment. Several managerial insights are obtained about the impact of available budget and target return on the optimal solutions. Notably, we have found that increasing target return may not necessarily result in
increase of optimal total expected return of the selected projects. Our model and solution method offer a unified and computationally tractable approach to precisely quantify the tradeoff between project returned and risk.

The supplier's credit term decision is simultaneously made with its production and inventory decisions, and most importantly, it is impacted by the buyer's order quantity. We present a new game-theoretic framework to model this problem, which captures the interaction between the supplier's credit term decision and the buyer's order decision in a multi-period setting. An exact method based on nonlinear programming is implemented to obtain the optimal solutions. We apply our methodologies on a real world case. The computational results show that our approach significantly outperforms the heuristics with fixed credit terms, and either a short or a long credit term can be sub-optimal for the supplier in profitability. Our work offers the first data-driven model and solution approach that assists purchasing and supply managers to make optimal dynamic credit term decision in conjunction with production, ordering and inventory decisions in a game-theoretic setting.

Current literature on SCC realises the importance of considering the demand dynamics associated with the new product diffusion (NPD). However, these studies assume one-segment market for new products, a single homogenous consumer segment. Recent research in marketing indicates that such simplification might be fatal because a diverse and significant number of product categories may experience a dual-market structure, namely early and main markets, and generate a different demand dynamics. The objectives of this study are to: (i) develop a hybrid optimisation model, capturing both SCC decisions and the demand dynamics of dual-market NPD process; (ii) based on real-world data for a host of electronic product categories, various SCC networks and NPD demand dynamics, examine the new integrated optimisation model under one- and two-segment market; and (iii) present relevant managerial implications and guidelines for supply chain and marketing managers. Our extensive comparative computational experiment with 26 categories of consumer electronic products show that on average the relative net profit may improve significantly, when the market is considered as two-segment.

In computational results, we demonstrate the trade-off and positive relationships between key item- and order-based inventory performance measures and short-term profitability under different levels of inventory budget in a multi-item finished goods inventory system.",Haitao Li; James F Campbell; Liu Yang,No,Basic or Discovery Scholarship,"Non-blind, Peer Reviewed",,,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

A new Markov decision process (MDP) model is developed for the SRCPSP-URA. It dynamically and adaptively determines not only which activity to start at a stage, but also which to interrupt and delay when there is not sufficient resource capacity. To tackle the curse-of-dimensionality of an exact solution approach, we devise and implement a rollout-based approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm with priority-rule heuristic as the base policy, for which theoretical sequential improvement property is proved. Computational results show that with moderately more computational time, our ADP algorithm significantly outperforms the priority-rule heuristics for test instances up to 120 activities.",Zhe Xu; Fang Xie; Haitao Li,No,Basic or Discovery Scholarship,,,,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,English,,Self-reported,
Haitao,Li,New Heuristics for the RCPSP with Multiple Overlapping Modes,Computers & Industrial Engineering,,2019.0,131,146-156,,,Completed/Published,,,,,Spring,2019,"Activity overlapping in project management and concurrent engineering allows a downstream activity to start before the end of its upstream activity based on some preliminary information and feedback. Because the preliminary information can be issued at multiple stages during an upstream activity’s execution, the downstream activity may have multiple overlapping modes. Project scheduling with activity overlapping has a wide range of applications in manufacturing, R&D, construction and professional service industries. An optimal overlapping plan may help project manager accelerate project progress effectively with improved rate of investment. In this research, we study a resource-constrained project scheduling problem with multiple overlapping modes, which is NP-hard. To obtain high-quality near-optimal solutions, we formulate it as a dynamic program (DP), and develop a rollout policy based approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm to obtain near-optimal policy efficiently. Our rollout policy sequentially improves over a priority-rule base policy. A rollout procedure based on pre-processing of overlapping options is also devised which we call pre-rollout. The pre-rollout improves over the rollout in some instances with moderately more computational time. A comprehensive experiment is performed on the PSPLIB benchmark instances. Computational results show that our rollout policy and the pre-rollout procedure significantly outperform the exact integer linear programming (ILP) solutions in both solution quality and computational time for medium and large instances.

Haitao,Li,Stochastic Single-Machine Scheduling with Learning Effect,IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,,2017.0,64,94-102,1,,Completed/Published,,,,,Spring,2017,"Learning is ubiquitous in the modern scheduling environment. While the deterministic scheduling problems with known processing time and learning rate have been extensively studied, limited work exists to address the problems with both learning effect and uncertainty. In this paper, the single-machine scheduling problem with random nominal processing time and/or random job-based learning rate is studied, with the objective of minimizing the expected total flow time and expected makespan. Several optimal policies are obtained: first, the shortest expected processing time is optimal when only the nominal processing time is random; second, when the job-based learning rate is random, the optimal policy can be obtained by solving an assignment problem with random assignment cost. Computational study is conducted to offer insights on the behavior of optimal policy. The expected value of perfect information (EVPI) is calculated as the difference between the expected objective value found by the optimal policy, and the expected objective value with perfect information. EVPI offers a practical way for decision makers to quantify the incentive and benefit of reducing uncertainty for the addressed problem. The results show that the performance of optimal policy will be negatively impacted by high variation of random parameters.

Our TS is built upon a new efficient solution representation scheme, which exploits both the permutation and knapsack features of BWTSP. We also embed our TS as a heuristic procedure to improve the upper bound in a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) method to enhance the performance of either a pure TS or MILP approach alone.

Carbon tax has proven to be an effective means to control emission and mitigate its negative impacts. This paper addresses the issue of optimal taxation target from the government’s perspective. Three schemes of carbon tax are considered in a Stackelberg game setting: production-only, consumer-only and mixed-type, where the government leads to determine the taxation rate, and an enterprise follows to optimize its production level and emission reduction. Closed-form analytical solutions are obtained in each case with a numerical study to get additional insights. The paper founds that government’s optimal decision on the taxation target depends on the magnitude of environmental impact of carbon emission. It may also vary with the performance metric to be achieved: maximizing social welfare as the government’s objective, maximizing profit as the enterprise’ objective, or minimizing the amount of carbon emission as social benefit. Our model and methods offer an analytical approach to provide informed decision support for policy makers regarding optimal carbon taxation target and level.",Haitao Li; Jie Chen; Wenguang Tang,No,Applied or Integration/Application Scholarship,,,,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

In this paper, we study a new decentralized multi-project time-cost tradeoff problem, called MPTCTP-D, where project scheduling and resource allocation decisions are made in a distributed way by autonomous project managers to optimize their local objective, subject to a global available budget for all the projects. We show and prove the existence of price of anarchy as the difference between the optimal objective value of MPTCTP-D and its centralized counterpart. A multi-agent based cooperative approach with negotiation protocol is proposed to mitigate resource competition of autonomous local decisions and achieve a reasonable allocation of resource for global decision-maker, with both exact and local-search based heuristic algorithms developed. Our exact algorithm is able to find optimal solutions and prove optimality for instances with up to five projects and 120 activities per project. The hybrid randomized and 2-opt improvement algorithm is able to efficiently find optimal solutions to small instances and significantly better solutions than other heuristics alone for instances with up to 20 projects and 120 activities per project. Managerial insights on the optimal solutions and the price of anarchy are obtained and discussed.

The multi-period stochastic resource planning (MPSRP) studied in this paper extends the one-period deterministic RP by explicitly coping with both internal resource attrition and project demand uncertainty in a sequential decision-making framework. It allows resource managers to make effective use of their internal resources and identify the need to outsource to external contingent resources. We model the MPSRP as a Markov decision process (MDP) and implement an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm to obtain dynamic and adaptive solutions in reasonable computation times. A comprehensive computational study shows that our ADP algorithm achieves higher profitability and internal resource utilization compared to the rolling horizon approach used as a benchmark.

A mixed-integer linear programming model is developed by explicitly accounting for various real-world complexities, such as nonstationary demand, arbitrary review period, and limited inventory budget. We apply the model to a 900-SKU experiment and observe an average 7.5% improvement in profit over the traditional ABC approach. A real-world application for a cheese manufacturer provides a nearly 3% improvement in company's profit with a 13% reduction in inventory capital compared to its current eight-class multi-criteria inventory classification scheme. Comprehensive computational experiments are performed to examine the individual and interactive effects of various parameters on the inventory performance. Results show that it is critical for a company to manage its inventory both dynamically in the face of nonstationary demand and holistically by integrating SKU classification and policy setting. Our work provides a practical decision-support tool that simultaneously optimizes multi-period inventory classification and control decisions under nonstationary demand. It contributes to the inventory management literature by bridging two distinct streams of inventory research, inventory classification and inventory optimization, within a practical inventory modeling framework. Our study also offers several managerial implications for manufacturers and distributors managing finished goods inventory.

It is of crucial importance in project scheduling to ensure the effective use of scarce and expensive renewable resources, and has been successfully applied to production environments, such as make-to-order and engineering-to-order systems. In real-life projects, general temporal relationships are often needed to model complex time-dependencies among activities. We develop a novel genetic algorithm (GA) for the resource levelling problem with generalised precedence relations. Our design and implementation of GA features an efficient schedule generation scheme, built upon a new encoding mechanism that combines the random key representation and the shift vector representation. A two-pass local search-based improvement procedure is devised and integrated into the GA to enhance the algorithmic performance. Our GA is able to obtain near optimal solutions with less than 2% optimality gap for small instances in fractions of a second. It outperforms or is competitive with the state-of-the-art algorithms for large benchmark instances with size up to 1000 activities.

Host countries are generally unprepared for the local impact of refugee resettlement, and because there are significant differences between (and within) refugee groups, even for experienced service providers, the process is challenging. Escaping refugees, powered by the urgency of conflicts with, and/or within, their homelands, are faced by a myriad of additional tests to their fortitude and flexibility. Nation states are not insular, regardless of distance from the country in conflict, and they either directly or indirectly experience the consequences of these conflicts. As host nations prepare to receive and integrate refugees, the global or international issue becomes a local one, and the local community moves to develop opportunities for these newly arriving populations. This paper presents an overview of the refugee experience, proposing that refugee resettlement is only a beginning, and acceptance and integration in the host country is a lifelong process.

The CCC is a component of two distinct complexes, the cleavage/polyadenylation complex and the complex that processes nonpolyadenylated histone pre-mRNAs. RNAi-depletion of CCC factors in Drosophila culture cells causes reduction of CCC processing activity on histone mRNAs, resulting in read through transcription. In contrast, RNAi-depletion of factors only required for histone mRNA processing allows use of downstream cryptic polyadenylation signals to produce polyadenylated histone mRNAs. We used Dmel-2 tissue culture cells stably expressing tagged CCC components to determine that amino acids 272-1080 of Symplekin and the C-terminal approximately 200 amino acids of both CPSF73 and CPSF100 are required for efficient CCC formation in vivo. Additional experiments reveal that the C-terminal 241 amino acids of CPSF100 are sufficient for histone mRNA processing indicating that the first 524 amino acids of CPSF100 are dispensable for both CCC formation and histone mRNA 3' end processing. CCCs containing deletions of Symplekin lacking the first 271 amino acids resulted in dramatic increased use of downstream polyadenylation sites for histone mRNA 3' end processing similar to RNAi-depletion of histone-specific 3' end processing factors FLASH, SLBP, and U7 snRNA. We propose a model in which CCC formation is mediated by CPSF73, CPSF100, and Symplekin C-termini, and the N-terminal region of Symplekin facilitates cotranscriptional 3' end processing of histone mRNAs.

Laura,Miller,From beautiful to cute: Shifting meanings in Japanese language and culture.,International Journal of Language and Culture,5/1/2021,2021.0,8,63-84,1,,In Press,https://doi.org/10.1075/ijolc,,,2214-3157,Spring,2023,"Japanese visual aesthetics as represented in traditional arts such as flower arranging, calligraphy and tea ceremony have long been celebrated or even emulated as exemplary expressions of beauty. The Japanese term utsukushii (beautiful) can be used to describe a wide variety of pleasing aspects of daily life, ranging from the human form to nature and even the gustatory experience. This article outlines traditional notions of beauty in the Japanese language, sketching forward to more contemporary expressions of visual culture that cluster around the term kawaii. This word is often translated as ‘cute’ in English, but we maintain that kawaii extends well beyond its denotative sense to encompass a more complex spectrum of meanings. For example, it can be used to describe objects and practices which have both sentimental charm as well as dark humour. We argue that the kawaii aesthetic has been successful because it serves important emotional and social functions. Finally, the differences between the terms utsukushii and kawaii are gendered and class based, with kawaii often providing a democratic expression of resistance to gendered processes of aging, ideas of class and taste, and attractiveness in Japan’s postmodern society. This essay begins with an overview of the semantic meanings of the concepts of beauty and cuteness in Japanese, followed by a discussion focused on the historical antecedents of the Japanese notion of cuteness. The third section shifts to an analysis of the expansion of the kawaii concept in post-war society and its socio-cultural functions. The essay closes with exploration of a few of the hybrid offshoots derived from kawaii, demonstrating that concepts of beauty in Japan are constantly changing and reacting to social and historical trends.",Carolyn S.

To support growth and identity development, students with IDD should have access to all aspects of college life (e.g., activities, relationships, opportunities). Furthermore, students with IDD should have the freedom to take emotional, physical, and intellectual risks relative to those of their peers without disabilities. This leading-edge article is written by practitioners and researchers with and without disabilities associated with the University of Missouri St. Louis IPSE program, Succeed. To center the voices of persons with disabilities, any direct quotations are in italics. In this article, we advocate for increased dignity of risk in IPSE, present a model to assess and make programmatic decisions regarding dignity of risk in IPSE, and highlight five philosophical values that guide our work toward ""messy inclusion."" Journal Description: Inclusive Practices is a practitioner-focused, research-to-practice journal designed to advance the TASH mission of equity, opportunity, and inclusion, for people with significant support needs. Articles in Inclusive Practices target research-based strategies and how they may translate into practice. Topics are of importance to practitioners working in the field of significant support needs (e.g., inclusion in the community, inclusive education, competitive integrated employment, self-advocacy, policy, integrated community living, diversity, human rights).

April,Regester,A conceptual framework for enabling risk in inclusive postsecondary education programs.,Inclusive Practices ,6/30/2022,2022.0,1,114-123,3,,Completed/Published,https://doi.org/10.1177/27324745221078599,,,,Summer,2022,"Abstract: More students with intellectual and developmental disability (IDD) are attending post-secondary education than ever before. As more students with IDD enter college, inclusive post-secondary education programs (IPSE) will be required to make important decisions about the types of services and supports they provide. IPSE Programs should aim to provide supports and services that honor student’s dignity of risk and facilitate opportunities for students to take risks. The purpose of this article is to describe a conceptual framework IPSE programs can use to assess the extent to which the supports and services they provide enable risk-taking opportunities for students in their program. The framework includes five steps: identify areas for growth, understand risks and rewards for students and stakeholders, evaluate natural supports and determine appropriate supplemental supports, identify and enable access to natural consequences, and reflect and plan for more authentic risk. An example of how to use the framework in the context of residential housing will be described. Journal Description: Inclusive Practices is a practitioner-focused, research-to-practice journal designed to advance the TASH mission of equity, opportunity, and inclusion, for people with significant support needs. Articles in Inclusive Practices target research-based strategies and how they may translate into practice. Topics are of importance to practitioners working in the field of significant support needs (e.g., inclusion in the community, inclusive education, competitive integrated employment, self-advocacy, policy, integrated community living, diversity, human rights).

Limited attention, however, has been given to potential contingencies in this relationship. The aim of this research is to extend previous school-based studies by examining whether and to what extent school context is differentially predictive of violent delinquency for immigrant and nonimmigrant youth. Using two waves of data from two multicity program evaluations, Teens, Crime, and the Community/Community Works (T.C.C./C.W.) and the Gang Resistance Education and Training (G.R.E.A.T.) program, we assess the impact of four measures of school climate on violent delinquency. Results highlight important contingencies in the relationship between immigrant status and violence.

What starts as a simple collection shift grows into a major space planning project, a lesson in catalog maintenance, and thanks to Hurricane Ike, a disaster recovery effort. The Big Shift tells the story of how the University of Houston Libraries handled the numerous roadblocks put in front of them during a large-scale project.

Zachary,Cairns,Interval-Class Succession Graphs,Music Theory and Analysis,1/21/2017,2018.0,4,,2,,Completed/Published,,,,,Summer,2019,"This article presents the interval-class succession graph (ICSG), an analytical tool intended for the comparison of twelve-tone row classes.  The ICSG takes a very intuitive form: the interval classes that are found between adjacent pitch classes of a twelve-tone row form the labels of the graphs nodes, and arrows are drawn between each node to indicate which successions of interval classes are found in the row.  In this article, I begin with a rationale for considering row classes in terms of their ordered interval-class content.  After discussing a rows adjacency matrix and defining the ICSG, I turn my attention to special graph-theoretic relationships between different ICSGs.  The paper concludes with some suggestions of ways in which the ICSG framework can be adapted to other musical contexts outside the realm of twelve-tone music.  An appendix provides an introduction to relevant terminology from the world of mathematical graph theory.",Zachary A Cairns,,,,International,None,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Lead / Corresponding author,,,,,English,,FAS and other legacy systems,
Zachary,Cairns,Switching the Backbeat: The Quick Flip and Polymetric Pogo in 1980s-era Rock Music,Music Theory Online,,2022.0,28,,1,,Completed/Published,,,,,Spring,2022,"This article explores manipulations of the nearly ever-present backbeat in rock music. The status of the backbeat as, not only metrically consonant, but as a defining feature of rock meter is discussed within the context of dual-aspect meter. Operating from the assumption that isochronous snare drum hits in rock are heard as a backbeat, placing those snare drum hits on beats other than 2 and 4 creates a particular kind of metrical dissonance, which I refer to as a backbeat switch. I examine two ways in which a backbeat shift occurs, the quick flip and the polymetric pogo. A quick flip usually occurs at a phrase break, where the drummer apparently (but intentionally) “drops a beat” and then resumes the backbeat pattern, thus shifting it “to the left.” A polymetric pogo involves a situation where the backbeat-insistent drummer is pitted against the rest of the band playing in an asymmetrical meter, resulting in snare hits that bounce back and forth between even-numbered beats and odd-numbered beats every other measure. Short examples by The Cars, Paul Weller, Steve Vai, and Sting are used to demonstrate the article’s fundamental concepts, and longer examples by Tesla, Jerry Goldsmith, and Extreme place these concepts into larger contexts.",Zachary A Cairns,,,,International,None,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Instead, this videocast aims to show that whole-tone collections are also used to accompany moments of what I call ""temporal dislocation,"" which refers to a moment in a film where the film's narrative, or a character, or the audience experiences a challenge of chronology, where we might not be so sure whether events are taking place in the past, present, or future. Using examples from ""The Muppet Christmas Carol,"" ""Bride of Frankenstein,"" ""Jaws,"" ""Back to the Future II,"" ""Frozen II,"" and ""Star Wars IV,"" I aim to show that whole-tone collections are used in these specific ways, and also more broadly to demonstrate various liminal states.",Zachary A Cairns,,,,International,None,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,English,,Self-reported,
Zachary,Cairns,‘Where Do We Go Now?’: Harmonic Departure and Return in the Guitar Solos of Guns N’ Roses,to be submitted to Music Theory Spectrum,,2023.0,,,,,In Progress,,,,,Summer,2023,"The guitar solo is a ubiquitous feature of 1980s/90s-era hard rock. Slash, the original lead guitarist for Guns N’ Roses, is known for his melodic, bluesy, and often virtuosic solos. The majority of Slash’s solos utilize some degree of what I call harmonic departure. Harmonic departure refers to the highlighting of a new harmonic area during the solo. This may be a modulation to a key that has not yet been explored in the song, or a move to a new chord (usually in a strong hypermetric position) that has not yet been used. Typically, departure engenders a return to the original riff or tonality at the end of the solo. This presentation will first examine all of Guns N’ Roses’ music from 1987 until Slash’s departure in 1996 in order to categorize their general approaches to harmonic departure and return. I will focus on the timing of the departure, the departure’s harmonic goal, and the method of return to the original tonality. After this, I will examine two cases from Appetite for Destruction that feature unusual return strategies: “Paradise City,” where the solo departs to the key of ii and then utilizes a post-solo bridge to delay the return to the original riff; and “Sweet Child O’ Mine,” where the solo again departs to the key of ii, but does not return to the original tonality at all. Instead, a new formal section begins, and the song ends in ii, over the repeated lyric “Where do we go now?”",Zachary Cairns,,,,International,None,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Lead / Corresponding author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Laura,Kuensting,Comparing Subcutaneous Fluid Infusion to Intravenous Fluid Infusion in Children,Journal of Emergency Nursing,1/1/2013,2013.0,,,,,Submitted,,,,,Spring,2013,"Introduction:  This study examined subcutaneous infusion as a parenteral alternative for children with mild to moderate illness.  The purpose was to compare the difference in infusion start time of parenteral fluid between an initial subcutaneous order and an initial intravenous order.  Also,  the number of needle sticks a child received for each method was evaluated.   Last, if subcutaneous fluids were given and an intravenous attempt was made later, did the administration of subcutaneous fluids enhance the success of venous cannulation?Methods:  A retrospective descriptive design was used for review of medical records for 36 children from November 2008 to May 2010 who had received subcutaneous fluids only or received subcutaneous fluids after 2 or more failed IV attempts.Results:  The intravenous/subcutaneous (IV/SC) group had significantly longer time to infusion (M = 97.33 minutes) than the subcutaneous (SC) group (M = 20.95 minutes; U = .000, p < .001). The IV/SC group included the number of needle sticks for the intravenous attempts plus the needle stick needed for the subcutaneous infusion.  A significant difference was found between the two groups (mean intravenous = 4.87, mean subcutaneous = 1; Z = .000, p < .001).Discussion:  In a child who is not seriously ill, subcutaneous infusions appear to facilitate the initiation of parenteral rehydration.  Subcutaneous infusions minimized the number of needle sticks a child endured.  More study is needed to determine if subcutaneous fluids enhance success of subsequent venous cannulation.",Laura Kuensting,,,,,,,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,,,FAS and other legacy systems,

This study examines how the sampling frequency for return calculation affects the intraday correlation and the lead-lag relationship between the Hong Kong Hang Seng Index futures, the underlying cash index, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that mimics the index, and each component stock. The paper uses firm bid and offer quotes to eliminate the negative bias in measuring the correlation between the futures and the less liquid stocks. The sampling frequency significantly affects the futures-stock dynamic relationship, particularly for small-cap stocks. The overall results indicate that market participants trade ETF and the largest index's constituent stocks to capitalize on index arbitrage opportunities. The lag of the cash index is greatest against futures price movement, a reflection of the adverse impact of stale prices on the informational role of stock indexes. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Adriano,Udani,Did the Paris Attacks Shape American Public Opinion?,,,2019.0,,,,,Work Discontinued,,,,,Fall,2019,"We examine the impact of the Paris attacks of November 13, 2015 on American public opinion. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attacks, which killed 130 people and wounded another 368. The attacks generated a lot of attention and fueled a wave of elite rhetoric focused on immigration and national security. The Paris attacks took place roughly in the middle of the field period for the 2015 Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES). This allows for a research design that compares the attitudes of respondents interviewed before the attacks versus those interviewed after the attacks. We examine our own CCES module that included questions about immigrants and immigration policy, as well as questions from the common content portion of the survey. Furthermore, CCES records the date and time when each survey is completed, which supports a regression discontinuity design to test for shifts in public opinion after the attacks. We hypothesize that the Paris attacks had an agenda-setting effect, increasing public concern about immigration, terrorism, and national security. In addition, we test whether the attacks primed anti-immigrant predispositions when respondents were asked their opinions about national security and immigration policies.

But, to what extent do beliefs about a perpetrator’s identity shape public support for efforts to prevent and punish voter fraud? Antipathy toward racial and ethnic groups is a strong predictor of public beliefs about voter fraud. Yet, prior studies have only been able to approximate beliefs about deviant behavior, and not specifically casting an illegal ballot. Drawing from sociology and criminology, we use a “typification” strategy that more directly measures which people are perceived as typical perpetrators of casting illegal ballots. We utilize nationally representative surveys of U.S. voters in 2017 – 2020  modules of the Cooperative Election Study (CES) to  apply and empirically test the typification theory. Among white respondents, we find that the typification of racially minoritized groups such as Blacks, Latinos, Arabs, and immigrants is widespread and is strongly associated with beliefs about voter fraud, support for restrictive election policies, and harsh punishment of illegal voting. The pictures of likely criminals that white voters carry in their heads shape their preferences for crime policies, and this extends to the domain of voter fraud.</span>",Adriano Anthony A Udani; Anita Marie Manion; David C Kimball,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,National,None,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Co-author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Our perspectives come from a virtual town hall hosted by the Community Innovation and Action Center (CIAC) at the University of Missouri, St. Louis on April 18, 2020. Based on these initial public discussions, weuse St. Louis as a lens for arguing that government’s attenuated impact is not due to a natural disaster itself, but the inevitable result of race-based policies that had worked against Black peoples over generations. The real failure involves our federalist system’s lack of a commitment to racial equity—when race no longer is used to predict life outcomes, and outcomes for all groups are improved—when designing the federal plan to respond to COVID-19 in local communities.",Katie Kaufmann (Role:Author); Désirée Jones-Smith (Role:Author); Sara John (Role:Author); Alicia Hernàndez (Role:Author); Sheila Renee Grigsby (Role:Author); Adriano Anthony A Udani Jr (Role:Author); Mark Tranel (Role:Author); Cordaryl Patrick (Role:Author); Christopher Prener (Role:Author),,,Blind Peer Reviewed,National,None,Critique / review,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Lead / Corresponding author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,4.0

Political rhetoric about these policies frequently links anxiety about immigration to concerns about voter fraud. However, we know relatively little about the sources of public support for election reforms that require prospective voters to show proof of citizenship, as opposed to more studied photo identification laws. We report the results of two survey experiments that test the impact of elite messages about voter fraud and immigrant threat on public support for stricter voter identification policies. We find a strong relationship between immigrant resentment and public support for voter identification restrictions, particularly proof of citizenship. Furthermore, elite messages that make claims about non-citizen voting or raise concerns about immigration boost public support for proof of citizenship laws. Thus, election reform proposals dealing with voter identification have become “immigrationalized.” ",Adriano Anthony A Udani; David C Kimball,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,National,College,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Co-author,UMSL College of Arts and Sciences,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Adriano,Udani,Did the Paris Attacks Shape American Public Opinion?,,,2019.0,,,,,Work Discontinued,,,,,Spring,2021,"We examine the impact of the Paris attacks of November 13, 2015 on American public opinion. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attacks, which killed 130 people and wounded another 368. The attacks generated a lot of attention and fueled a wave of elite rhetoric focused on immigration and national security. The Paris attacks took place roughly in the middle of the field period for the 2015 Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES). This allows for a research design that compares the attitudes of respondents interviewed before the attacks versus those interviewed after the attacks. We examine our own CCES module that included questions about immigrants and immigration policy, as well as questions from the common content portion of the survey. Furthermore, CCES records the date and time when each survey is completed, which supports a regression discontinuity design to test for shifts in public opinion after the attacks. We hypothesize that the Paris attacks had an agenda-setting effect, increasing public concern about immigration, terrorism, and national security. In addition, we test whether the attacks primed anti-immigrant predispositions when respondents were asked their opinions about national security and immigration policies.

We contend that the asylum process in the United States exhibits how confinement, surveillance, and deportation work together to extend the primary logics of white supremacy: genocide, anti-blackness, and orientalism. We envision abolition work that uplifts not only asylum seekers but all people with lived experiences of coerced mobility.

Methods

Through the lenses of critical race, decolonial theory, and abolition, we conceptualize the asylum process beyond only one violent system that coerces the mobility of migrants.

Results

We build a theory that extends scholarly conversations about asylum processes as a system of racial/colonial surveillance, control, and state-sanctioned violence and that informs abolitionist practices.

Conclusion

In order to eradicate all forms of detention, we must build robust strategies that demolish the pillars of white supremacy and rebuild new politics that reject the notion of freedom as a reward to well-behaved people, resist coerced mobility, foster shared power arrangements in which people with lived experiences of oppression organize to help each other, and reorient a capitalist system that commoditizes and exploits people's oppression.

Scholars have also noted that a plethora of terms representing a participatory research paradigm are difficult to decipher and have become intermingled (Wallerstein and Duran 2008). How then should political scientists distinguish CER in this constellation of scholarship? More importantly, how should political scientists do CER? 
To explore these questions, we situate CER in the context of two dominant participatory frameworks: Community-based participatory research (CBPR) and research-practice partnerships (RPPs). We first identify CER guiding principles that are shared across the two frameworks. We then identify areas that distinguish CER. CER has much to offer to participatory research. Yet, there is more work to be done to improve the praxis of partnership.

However, some sources of public beliefs about voter fraud have received little attention. We identify two conditions that combine to make anti-immigrant attitudes a strong predictor of voter fraud beliefs. First, the recent growth and dispersion of the immigrant population makes immigration a salient consideration for many Americans. Second, an immigrant threat narrative in political discourse linking immigration to crime and political dysfunction has been extended to the voting domain. Using new data from a survey module in the 2014 Cooperative Congressional Election Study and the 2012 American National Election Study, we show that immigrant resentment is strongly associated with voter fraud beliefs. Widespread hostility toward immigrants helps nourish public beliefs about voter fraud and support for voting restrictions in the United States. The conditions generating this relationship in public opinion likely exist in other nations roiled by immigration politics. The topic of fraudulent electoral practices will likely continue to provoke voters to call to mind groups that are politically constructed as “un-American.”",Adriano Anthony A Udani; David C Kimball,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,National,College,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Co-author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,31.0

Adriano,Udani,The Consequences of Immigration Law Enforcement on Latino Support for State Retrenchment ,Policy Studies Journal,,2018.0,,,,,In Progress,,,,,Fall,2021,"Studies show that support for state expansion and economic redistribution policies hinge on whether people actually know that they receive benefits from government. Yet, a conspicuous omission in this line of scholarship concerns Latinos and the extent to which they experience immigration policy as highly salient and a directly consequential factor in one’s life. Using a representative sample of 2,000 Latino adults in the 2016 Latino Cooperative Congressional Election Study, I find that Latino support for state expansion through taxation declines as immigration law enforcement has a more frequent presence in one’s life, even among Latinos with higher levels of direct social program utilization. For Latinos who do favor tax increases, my results show that their support is associated with higher usage of social welfare programs, but is also attributed to feeling that immigration law enforcement does not affect their lives at all. The results not only provide further understanding of the intersection between the U.S. welfare state and immigration system, but also shed light on the challenges that elected officials confront when reshaping Latino political attitudes toward social policy reforms. That is, the ways in which the state enforces immigration laws can undermine its growth.",Adriano Anthony A Udani Jr,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,National,None,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Lead / Corresponding author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

We argue that a “demographic divide”—a growing divergence in the age structures of blacks and whites—was an important factor that contributed to the nation’s rising incarceration rates. Where age disparities between blacks and whites were higher ideological conservatism and religious fundamentalism increased, as did incarceration rates. We contend that historical forces shape how groups respond to subsequent social problems and proposed solutions to them and explore how “generational effects” may shape law and policy. Specifically, we suggest that states with older white and younger black populations created fertile conditions for a more punitive brand of politics and penal policy. We analyze decennial state-level data from 1970 to 2010 and examine whether differences in the median ages of blacks and whites contributed to changing incarceration rates within states over time. We situate our findings within the broader scholarship that has engaged the complex links between race, religion, political conservatism, and punishment.

Competing processes linking vicarious peer victimization and violence are empirically evaluated including social learning theory, general stain theory, and peer group selection models. The analyses use peer-network data from three waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). Regression models demonstrate that the association between vicarious peer victimization and violence is attributed primarily to peer-group selection and social learning mechanisms. These findings indicate that victimization affects not only the immediate victims of violence, but permeates throughout adolescent social networks.

Michael,Campbell,"The demographic divide: Population dynamics, race and the rise of mass incarceration in the United States",Punishment & Society-International Journal of Penology,,2017.0,,,,,Completed/Published,https://doi.org/10.1177/1462474517734166,,,,Fall,2017,"This manuscript examines whether certain fundamental demographic changes in age structures across racial groups might help explain incarceration rates in the United States. We argue that a “demographic divide”—a growing divergence in the age structures of blacks and whites—was an important factor that contributed to the nation’s rising incarceration rates. Where age disparities between blacks and whites were higher ideological conservatism and religious fundamentalism increased, as did incarceration rates. We contend that historical forces shape how groups respond to subsequent social problems and proposed solutions to them and explore how “generational effects” may shape law and policy. Specifically, we suggest that states with older white and younger black populations created fertile conditions for a more punitive brand of politics and penal policy. We analyze decennial state-level data from 1970 to 2010 and examine whether differences in the median ages of blacks and whites contributed to changing incarceration rates within states over time. We situate our findings within the broader scholarship that has engaged the complex links between race, religion, political conservatism, and punishment. Our findings illustrate the importance of accounting for long-term shifts in social structure in understanding more proximate changes in law and policy.",Michael Carl Campbell II; Matthew S Vogel,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,,None,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Co-author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

in the United States in the latter half of the twentieth century. It outlines
how research focused on developments in the states provides unique insights
into the forces that helped drive mass incarceration and has generated rich
historical accounts of how mass incarceration emerged within specific contexts.
It charts some of the new theorizing that has emerged from state case
studies, including those emphasizing how penal change is characterized by
conflict and others that conceptualize state developments as they interact
with federal processes. These insights are then considered against broader
national theories of punishment. The manuscript outlines how some of the
key forces operating at the state level, including penal cultures, institutional
structures, and interest-group activism, conditioned state penal trajectories.
Lastly, the piece identifies potential avenues for future state-level research
on the forces shaping penal law and policy",Michael Carl Campbell II,,,Editorially Reviewed,,None,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Two meta-analyses were conducted; one comprised experimental research measuring rhythmic sight reading (46 studies; 68 individual analyses) and another comprised research measuring melodic sight reading (21 studies; 35 individual analyses). Analyses revealed small overall effect sizes (Rhythmic: d = −0.34, 95% CI [−0.50, –0.19]; Melodic: d = −0.35, 95% CI [−0.59, –0.12]). Moderator variables were used to examine how effect size was influenced by treatment type and other study-level design elements. Treatment type significantly influenced both rhythmic and melodic sight reading. For rhythm, treatments that focused on counting systems and included movement or rhythmic drill positively affected sight reading. Melodic results are preliminary due to the limited number of studies, but based on the information available, treatments using collaboration activities or instrumental training positively affected sight reading. Varying notation did not improve sight reading. The type of sight reading (rhythmic, melodic) significantly affected the effectiveness of some treatments.",Jennifer Mishra,,,,International,None,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Lead / Corresponding author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

In Experiment 1, musicians (n = 22) read letter sequences and labelled notated pitches in two conditions: congruent (letters matched pitch names) or incongruent (letters randomly assigned). Significant interactions occurred between congruency condition and musical feature, for both speed and accuracy. There was an asymmetrical effect:  incongruence did not affect reading of letter sequences but impaired pitch labelling. Experiment 2 eliminated feature suppression, requiring both melody and lyrics to be produced simultaneously. Musicians (n = 32) sightsang pitches paired with either congruent or incongruent letter sequences or on a neutral syllable (control). Significant effects were found for both speed and accuracy. Both facilitation and interference effects were evident. Melody and lyrics are partly independent processes but compete for shared attentional resources, with lyrics processed faster than melody.",Philip Fine; Jennifer Mishra,,,,,,,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,,,FAS and other legacy systems,

An emerging line of research suggests that the apparent increase may be due to complacency, whereby faith in medicine encourages risk-taking behavior. This study examines the hypothesis that certain approaches in the news media could disproportionately influence perceptions of treatment success even when paired with statistics. College students and gay men, recruited in the community, were exposed to a fictional news story in which the ratio of four cases of people taking antiretroviral (ARV) medications was varied in two conditions. The story was either consistent with or inconsistent with the success-rate data presented by an alleged medical expert in the story. Participants' perceptions of ARV success were estimated following exposure to the story. As expected, the personal news stories influenced estimation of ARV success more than the presence of statistical success rate data. Consistent with previous exemplification research, the size of the effect suggests that the stories influenced judgments of the true success rate by roughly 10 to 20%. The effect was moderated by sexual orientation, but not by gender. Exemplification as a journalistic tendency may be one factor that contributes to unrealistic faith in medical advancements. These data suggest that future research should explore in detail the extent and context of HIV/AIDS reporting using exemplification theory with considerations for how reporting might be modified to have less of an effect on increased sexual risk-taking.

from each other, and from the aggressive territorial hummingbirds. When food types were shared, each butterfly
species fed at different times and on different plants. Additionally, each species changed the number of visits to
plants, number of plants visited, and time spent feeding thereby achieving successful coexistence.

Yuefeng,Wu,Bernstein von Mises theorem of Dirichlet mixture of Beta densities in estimating positive false discovery rates,,,,,,,,In Progress,,,,,Fall,2018,"Multiple hypothesis testing is an important for statistical research, especially in relation to applications in genomic and some other emerging fields. Te false discovery rate and its variants provide very important notions of errors in this context comparable to the role of error probabilities in classical testing problems.  The model-based nonparametric Bayesian method of estimation of the pFDR function is commonly used in practice. This method uses a mixture of decreasing beta densities and an appropriate Dirichlet process as a prior on the mixing measure. The simulation study and the theoretical study both showed the consistency of this method. In this paper, we provide Bernstein von Mises theorem of this method, which showed that not only the density of p-values converges to the true probability density, but also the FDR converges to the true FDR in Gaussian distribution.

Yuefeng,Wu,(R) Consistency of Kernel Mixture Priors in Bayesian Density Estimation for Distributions with Unknown Support,,,,,,,,In Progress,,,,,Spring,2019,"We consider the Bayesian inference in density estimation problem with unknown support. We show that if the prior for the distribution assigns positive probabilities to a certain type of neighborhoods of the true distribution, then the posterior distribution is consistent in the weak topology. In particular, this implies that the posterior distribution of the boundary values of the support are consistent in the Euclidean metric. The result follows from the generalization of a celebrated result of Schwartz to the independent, non-identical case and the existence of exponentially consistent tests of the complement of the neighborhoods shown here. We then specialize to a prior commonly used in practice, the Dirichlet mixtures, and showed that under appropriate conditions this prior satisfies the positivity requirement of the prior probabilities of the neighborhoods of the true density. We consider the case of both bounded and half bounded supports.

Yuefeng,Wu,(R) Learning rules and simple decision making algorithms in foraging bumble bees,Behavioral Ecology,,,,,,,In Progress,,,,,Spring,2019,"Animals must make estimates about possible resources in order to choose the resource which will save them time and energy while conferring high energetic content. In order to make the most optimal decision, foragers must use various parameters to come up with an accurate estimate for each possible alternative. Learning rules allow us the possibility of analyzing which parameters animals may be using in order to make the best decision. We use compare known learning rules (i.e. linear operator rule, relative payoff sum rule, perfect memory) and experimental data extracted from bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) subjected to a two-armed bandit scenario in order to find what learning rule best describes their foraging choices in a changing environment. Furthermore, we compared learning rules by using three different information types (i.e. no-cue, non-social, and social) in order to better understand how memory responds to different stimuli. Our findings suggest that the perfect memory best predicts the foraging patterns of bees, where social information increases the likelihood of the learning rule to better predict choice.

It is not rare that the ARMS is trapped away from some subspace with significant probability in the support of the multivariate distribution. While the ARMS updates samples only in the directions that are parallel to dimensions, our proposed method, the hit and run ARMS (HARARMS), updates samples in arbitrary directions determined by the hit and run algorithm, which makes it almost not possible to be trapped in any isolated subspaces. The HARARMS performs the same as ARMS in a single dimension while more reliable in multidimensional spaces. Its performance is illustrated by a Bayesian free-knot spline regression example. We showed that it overcomes the well-known ‘lethargy’ property and decisively find the global optimal number and locations of the knots of the spline function.

Yuefeng,Wu,(R) A Bayesian Nonparametric Framework for Uncertainty Quantification in Simulation,Operations Research,,,,,,,Revise & Resubmit,,,,,Summer,2019,"When we use simulation to assess the performance of stochastic systems, the input models used to drive simulation experiments are often estimated from finite real-world data. There exist both input and simulation estimation uncertainty in the system performance estimates. Without strong prior information on the input models and the system mean response surface, in this paper, we propose a  Bayesian nonparametric framework to quantify the impact from both sources of uncertainty. Specifically, nonparametric input models are introduced to faithfully capture the important features of the real-world data, such as heterogeneity, multi-modality and skewness. Bayesian posteriors of flexible input models characterize the input uncertainty, which automatically accounts for both model selection and parameter value uncertainty. Then, the input uncertainty is propagated to outputs by using direct simulation. Thus, under very general conditions, our framework delivers an empirical credible interval accounting for both input and simulation uncertainties. A variance decomposition is further developed to quantify the relative contributions from both sources of uncertainty. Our approach is supported by rigorous theoretical and empirical study.

This paper seeks to extend these results to the use of nonparametric Bayesian density estimators within disparity methods. We propose two estimators: one replaces the kernel density estimator with the expected posterior density using a random histogram prior;  the other transforms the posterior over densities into a posterior over parameters through minimizing the Hellinger distance for each density.   We show that it is possible to adapt the mathematical machinery of efficient influence functions from semiparametric models to demonstrate that both our estimators are efficient in the sense of achieving the Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound. We further demonstrate a Bernstein-von-Mises result for our second estimator, indicating that its posterior is asymptotically Gaussian. In addition, the robustness properties of classical minimum Hellinger distance estimators continue to hold.

We propose to modify a prior over non-parametric densities with the exponential of twice the Hellinger distance between a candidate and a parametric density. By incorporating a prior over the parameters of the second density, we arrive at a hierarchical model in which a non-parametric model is placed between parameters and the data. The parameters of the family can then be estimated as hyperparameters in the model. In frequentist estimation, minimizing the Hellinger distance between a kernel density estimate and a parametric family has been shown to produce estimators that are both robust to outliers and statistically efficient when the parametric model is correct. In this paper, we demonstrate that the same results are applicable when a non-parametric Bayes density estimate replaces the kernel density estimate. We then demonstrate that robustness and efficiency also hold for the proposed hierarchical model. The finite-sample behavior of the resulting estimates is investigated by simulation and on real world data.

Yuefeng,Wu,(R) Impact of Missouri’s Primary Care Health Home program on healthcare service utilization,Health Services Research,,,,,,,In Progress,,,,,Fall,2018,"Missouri was one of the first states to implement Primary Care Health Homes (PCHH) as part of the Affordable Care Act. In this report we focus on the healthcare utilization outcomes for ER use, hospital admissions and hospital length of stay for PCHH participants compared to a propensity score matched control group. Decreases in healthcare utilization for ER visits and hospital length of stay were observed, as well as an interaction between each of the utilization measures and Medicaid eligibility months.  On average, enrollees in the PCHH had fewer ER visits, hospital admissions, and hospital days with increasing Medicaid eligibility compared to the control group. These results indicate that additional time in the PCHH may result in reductions in healthcare utilization over time.

Regarding your editorial “Sharing the Wealth of Markets” (Sept. 21): Yes, recent stock price increases aren’t creating new wealth as broadly as most would like because the market isn’t providing adequate liquidity for the kind of firms that drive economic growth. We believe that much of the blame rests with Federal Reserve policy. 
The New Keynesian model the Fed uses led, in part, to paying banks interest on excess reserves in 2008. Before 2008 excess reserves were virtually zero but now hover near $2 trillion. This is no longer a rational response to the financial panic of 2008-09. Interest payments made by the Fed on those reserves have helped make major banks richer by not issuing loans from reserves but instead earning interest at no risk.
Before 2008, competition between banks forced them to loan out or otherwise invest excess reserves. This produced new economic activity that produced economic gains outside the banking sector. If the Fed began reducing the interest paid on excess reserves, the excess reserves would begin to enter the system and make capital available to startups by increasing liquidity.
If the near $2 trillion of excess reserves entered circulation tomorrow, it would soon expand the money stock, igniting a major inflation. Interest rates paid on excess reserves should therefore be cut in several stages. But if there ever was a compelling argument for paying banks to hold on to excess reserves, that time is past. The sooner the Fed unwinds this practice the sooner we can avoid frustrating the emergence and expansion of a new generation of wealth-creating firms.

This endogenous velocity enables a sequence of shocks to the bank sector and the goods sector to explain with the model the rate inversion as seen in the 2007 to 2017 data. To do this, it combines a sequence of initially negative bank productivity shocks with a sequence of subsequently negative goods sector productivity shocks.

In “Pause Interest-Rate Hikes to Help the Labor Force Grow” (op-ed, Oct. 26), Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari is mistaken in two important ways. Federal Reserve interest rates of 2% to 2.25% aren’t neutral if the inflation rate is 2.61%, as it is as of the third quarter of 2018. This gives a negative real interest rate of at least 0.36%. Only a positive rate of real interest in the 2% to 3% range is “neutral,” as during phases of the high-growth era of the 1980s and 1990s.
The Federal Reserve’s forcing of negative real interest rates for most of the 18 years since 2000, with the exception of about three years, has encouraged the substitution of capital for labor. This means the labor force gets paid less. This can help explain why the labor participation rate fell from 2000 to 2017, and now is finally starting to turn upward as interest rates rise.
Note that the Fed targets the personal consumption expenditures deflator index, and not the consumer price index, as a possible defense for President Kashkari. Everyone else across the globe uses the CPI as the key price-index measure of inflation.

It shows how a decrease in the tax rate causes the tax elasticity and welfare cost to decrease in magnitude by more than with zero evasion. And it provides conditions by which a stable share of income tax revenue in output can occur over time, even with tax rate reduction occurring gradually. Given a rising productivity trend, the paper shows that this causes less evasion, increases tax revenue as a percent of income, and allows for tax rate reduction while keeping constant the income tax revenue to output ratio. The model is illustrated for less and more productive economies, with sensitivity analysis, and with discussion on how postwar US income tax rate reductions can induce less tax evasion, lower welfare cost, and make for a stable income tax share of output.",Max Kenneth Gillman (Role:Author),,,Blind Peer Reviewed,International,Hayek Professorship endowment fund,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Lead / Corresponding author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Regarding your editorial “Sharing the Wealth of Markets” (Sept. 21): Yes, recent stock price increases aren’t creating new wealth as broadly as most would like because the market isn’t providing adequate liquidity for the kind of firms that drive economic growth. We believe that much of the blame rests with Federal Reserve policy. 
The New Keynesian model the Fed uses led, in part, to paying banks interest on excess reserves in 2008. Before 2008 excess reserves were virtually zero but now hover near $2 trillion. This is no longer a rational response to the financial panic of 2008-09. Interest payments made by the Fed on those reserves have helped make major banks richer by not issuing loans from reserves but instead earning interest at no risk.
Before 2008, competition between banks forced them to loan out or otherwise invest excess reserves. This produced new economic activity that produced economic gains outside the banking sector. If the Fed began reducing the interest paid on excess reserves, the excess reserves would begin to enter the system and make capital available to startups by increasing liquidity.
If the near $2 trillion of excess reserves entered circulation tomorrow, it would soon expand the money stock, igniting a major inflation. Interest rates paid on excess reserves should therefore be cut in several stages. But if there ever was a compelling argument for paying banks to hold on to excess reserves, that time is past. The sooner the Fed unwinds this practice the sooner we can avoid frustrating the emergence and expansion of a new generation of wealth-creating firms.

Max,Gillman,Supply-Side Economics with AS-AD in Ramsey Dynamic General Equilibrium,Economic Analysis and Policy ,,2023.0,,,,,Submitted,,,,,Spring,2023,"While the Neoclassical dynamic general equilibrium (DGE) model has been applied clearly to the labor market, it has not been clarified for the goods market in which aggregate supply and demand for goods arises. The problem has been the inability to recognize the microeconomic-based relative price that exists with this DGE foundation of modern dynamic macroeconomics. The paper shows that the relative price is the time required per good. It then applies the framework to demonstrate how increasing productivity and decreasing income tax rates can be viewed through a rigorously derived aggregate supply (AS) and aggregate demand (AD) analysis found within the baseline model of Ramsey's dynamic neoclassical foundation. This dynamic stationary theory of value is derived in terms of the aggregate supply and demand for output and its relative price, which is the nominal price of goods divided by the nominal price of labor. The productivity increase and corporate tax rate decrease cause a net shift out in aggregate supply and illustrate foundations of supply-side economics. A decrease in the labor income tax rate causes a proportionate shift out in both AS and AD, rather than the net supply-side shift characteristic of supply-side economics. The paper extends the concepts of AS-AD to derive both a Hicksian, utility-constant aggregate demand with only substitution effects, as well as a Marshallian version that allows both income and substitution effects. An alternative version of the relative price of output as the real interest rate is presented, in which a productivity increase keeps AD unchanged while aggregate supply shifts out. Additional extensions make clear the consistency of the AS-AD framework with the labor market, capital market, isoquant and production function realms, and with the implied consumption function that are well-known standards of analysis, even though the AS-AD foundation to date remains in an unnecessary impasse.",Tamas Z.` Csabafi (Role:Author); Max Kenneth Gillman (Role:Author); Szilard Benk (Role:Author),,,Blind Peer Reviewed,International,Commissioned,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Lead / Corresponding author,,"Conception and execution of entire paper, with helpful comments from coauthors.",,,English,,Self-reported,

Impulse responses show the significance of our two additional monetary shocks in impacting real oil prices.

Decomposition of historical oil price shocks shows a significant role played by inflation expectations and the money supply shocks during major oil shock episodes.

We find that volatility matters. To advance from linear models as in previous work, we estimate volatility-based Markov-switching regimes within a vector autoregression framework to identify significant Granger-predictability. We combine this with estimated impulse responses of shocks from nominal variables on real asset prices in both low and high volatility regimes. Through the theoretic lens of maintaining the present value of the asset flow with a competitive market return to capital, high volatility times with sudden jumps in the US money supply or inflation expectations cause jumps in the discount rate on the present value income stream that induce jumps in asset prices. Consistent with this we find that in crises periods of high volatility narrower US money supply aggregates and inflation variables significantly Granger-predict and shock upwards both real oil and gold prices. Nominal variables also significantly Granger-predict the USD exchange rate in both regimes. In the <br>low volatility regime associated with more normal business cycle fluctuations and moderate changes in money supply and inflation, present value theory suggests a stable <br>discount rate such that oil and gold prices need only change in tandem with the inflation rate to maintain present value. Consistent with this we find that in the low volatility regime, the inflation related variables more than the money supply aggregates Granger-predict real oil and gold prices and shock down the exchange rate.",Sel Dibooglu (Role:Author); Emrah Cevik (Role:Author); Max Kenneth Gillman (Role:Author),,,Blind Peer Reviewed,International,Commissioned,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Lead / Corresponding author,,Wrote most of the paper; developed the theory; interpreted the results relative to the theory,,,English,,Self-reported,

We found that mobile health interventions were significantly more effective than comparison/control conditions at improving health outcomes. Furthermore, results indicated that there were several moderators of the relative effectiveness of mobile health interventions. This study adds to knowledge related to mobile health intervention effectiveness and the conditions under which such interventions have a particular advantage over comparison interventions and standard-of-care.

Brandon,Ofem,The Collaboration Networks of Economic Development Organizations in Eastern Kentucky,Journal of Appalachian Studies,,2015.0,21,105--127,,,Completed/Published,,,,,Fall,2015,"This study describes the patterns of collaboration among economic development organizations (EDOs) in eastern Kentucky. Economic development organizations work to improve the economic conditions of their respective locales. They operate in a region facing many historical barriers to economic sustainability, and where resource scarcity is the norm. Given this distressed context, a deeper understanding of how these organizations work together provides valuable insight into practices that promote or discourage goal attainment. Employing a social network perspective, we examine the patterns of collaboration between ninety- eight EDOs currently operating in the region. Data were collected through in-depth interviews with EDO leaders and via an online survey. In this paper, we review the relevant literature and our methodology, identify the population of such organizations, describe their characteristics, and illustrate the various ways in which they collaborate. Our findings reveal that although EDOs share a common mission to promote local economic development, they vary widely in their service offerings and geographic scope, and only leverage about 8 percent of their networking potential.",Jane Jensen; Seungahn Nah; Walter Ferrier; Stephen Borgatti; Sara Compion; Patricia Cook-Craig; Brandon Ofem,No,Basic or Discovery Scholarship,Blind Peer Reviewed,,Research Board,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,NSF SES-1063773,Contribution: 50%; Completed at UMSL.

Brandon,Ofem,(R) Too tight to move? How cultural norms and stereotypes regulate imprinting in hybrid social venturing,Journal of Business Venturing,,2021.0,36,,4,,Completed/Published,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusvent.2021.106127 ,,,,Spring,2021,"Abstract: Though discussion of culture is central in the literature on gender in entrepreneurial settings, prior studies have paid scant attention to the specific impact of cultural norms. We propose that the impact of gender composition in new venture teams (NVTs) on commercialization of social ventures is contingent on the strength of cultural norms of a nation. Our view of gender as a culture-contingent resource reveals ordering mechanisms that distinguish gender effects in culturally tight versus culturally loose societies with respect to commercialization intent and legal form. The empirical analysis of an international sample of 6657 social ventures from 30 countries supports the study hypotheses. The findings show that gender differences in new ventures are more significant in tight societies compared to loose societies.

",Journal of Management,,2022.0,,,,,In Progress,,,,,Summer,2022,"Abstract: Patents are of critical strategic importance in the context of technology entrepreneurship. In this study, we investigate the age and gender-related differences in patenting for technology entrepreneurs. We draw on upper echelons and generational arguments to theorize that there is a curvilinear association between new venture founders’ age and patenting, with distinct moderating effects based on gender. Leveraging a global sample of 2848 new technology ventures across several industries, our analysis broadly supports the hypotheses and provides empirical evidence of the powerful role of age and gender in shaping innovation outcomes for new technology ventures.

Our analysis of data from 98 collaborating economic development organizations operating in the economically distressed region of eastern Kentucky shows that EO and collaborative engagement are positively associated with performance.

Brandon,Ofem,Looking at our STEM Teacher Workforce: How to Model Self-efficacy,Economic Development Quarterly,,2021.0,,,,,Completed/Published,,,,,Spring,2021,"There is currently a severe shortage of teachers in the US workforce. The problem is especially acute among STEM teachers and exacerbated by high turnover among new teachers – those with less than 5 years of teaching experience. In this paper, we investigate one piece of the puzzle. We model a social cognitive approach to understanding self-efficacy, a key precursor to job performance and retention. Our interactionist approach accounts for both demographic (i.e. gender and age) and relational variables (i.e. social networks). We test our ideas on a sample 159 STEM teachers across five geographic regions in the United States. Our analysis reveals patterned differences in self-efficacy across gender that are contingent on the communities of practice in which the teachers are embedded. Together, our theory and findings highlight the value of taking a holistic, interactionist view in explaining STEM teacher self-efficacy.",Rebecca Konz; Samuel J Polizzi; Michael Beeth; Gregory T Rushton; Jessica Doering; Brock Couch; Keith Sheppard; Gillian Roehrig; Brandon Rowan Ibiang Ofem,Yes,Basic or Discovery Scholarship,Blind Peer Reviewed,,Research Board,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Lead / Corresponding author,NSF Awards DUE-1035451 and DUE-1660736,Contribution: 75%; initiated and completed at UMSL.

The central premise is that CVC funding will encourage the development of technology-centric IP outcomes while dissuading the development of market-centric IP outcomes. Specifically, CVC investments entail a trade-off, which will increase post-funding patent/copyright output while decreasing post-funding trademark output in new firms. Findings from an analysis of a multi-industry sample of U.S. new firms provide broad support for this study thesis and suggest that the impact of CVC funding is contingent on entrepreneurs’ industry-specific experience.",Satish Nambisan; Ikenna Uzuegbunam; Brandon Ofem,Yes,Basic or Discovery Scholarship,Blind Peer Reviewed,,None,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,Contribution: 40%; initiated and completed at UMSL.

Brandon,Ofem,An Exploration of Communities of Practice in the STEM Teacher Context: What Predicts Ties of Retention?,Journal of STEM Teacher Education,,2022.0,,,,,Completed/Published,,,,,Fall,2022,"The STEM teacher workforce in the United States has faced a host of pressing challenges, including teacher shortages, pervasive job dissatisfaction, and high turnover, problems largely attributable to working conditions within schools and districts. These problems have been exacerbated in high-needs districts with fewer resources and more students from low-income communities. Since social network research has shown that workplace relationships are vital for retention, this study investigates the demographic and relational antecedents to what we dub ties of retention. We explore how demographic and relational properties affect the likelihood that teachers have “retention-friendly” networks, characterized by connections important for retention. Our analysis of data from a sample of 120 STEM teachers across five geographic regions identifies key demographics (i.e., site, gender, career changer, and prior teaching experience) and relational properties (network size, positive affect, and perceptions of bridging) associated with ties of retention.

For this reason, the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury Regulations limit corporate compensation deductions to “reasonable compensation”; however, primary tax authorities do not provide a standard definition, leaving the courts to determine what is reasonable and what is not. The courts have generally followed two approaches: a multi-factor test and an independent investor test. <br><br>We provide an in-depth exploration of reasonable compensation case law with a focus on disparity within and across court circuits. <br><br>We supplement this exploration with an analysis of whether multi-factor determined court outcomes would have changed under the independent investor test.

Michele,Meckfessel,Are all non-GAAP disclosures created equal?,Business Horizons,1/31/2021,2021.0,64,18-Jul,1,,Completed/Published,,,,,Spring,2021,"<br>(R) Publicly traded companies in the U.S. must prepare financial statements in accordance with the requirements of U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP). However, many companies also report non-GAAP measures—those calculated outside the requirements of U.S. GAAP—in their earnings announcements, annual reports, and SEC filings. The SEC began regulating the release of non-GAAP measures in 2003 and has expressed ongoing concern regarding firms’ disclosure of the same, but the use of non-GAAP measures continued to increase nonetheless. A 2018 Audit Analytics report found that in 2006, 76% of SEC filers included non-GAAP measures, but in 2017 that percentage rose to 96%.
<p>In this article we provide an overview of the SEC regulations regarding non-GAAP measures, examine how investors react to non-GAAP disclosures, and provide guidance regarding how companies can avoid receiving a non-GAAP disclosure comment letter from the SEC.</p>

Michele,Meckfessel,Meeting the Demands of the Accounting Curriculum: An Integrated Approach Using a Tax Research Case Assignment.,Advances in Accounting Education: Teaching and Curriculum Innovations,2020,2020.0,24,49-66,,,Completed/Published,,,,,Summer,2020,"<p><br>(R) In this paper we discuss a pedagogical approach that incorporates multiple critical topics in the accounting curriculum using an integrated tax research case. Our approach is designed to develop students research, data management and analysis, critical thinking, decision-making, and professional communication skills. These goals are achieved through the use of an integrated assignment requiring students to conduct research, decide how to use an assortment of information sources, conduct analysis of data and business documents, and arrive at and communicate a conclusion.</p>
<p>The key issue is reasonable compensation, a highly litigated tax issue which requires students to identify relevant authority found across many court cases. We created a closely held business with multiple family members with different fact patterns to expose students to different outcomes with a varying degree of complexity. Students were required to analyze business documents and firm-and industry-level data created by the authors to determine the appropriate tax treatment. Further, the case scenario exploits the fact that reasonable compensation is a tax issue in which circuit courts have ruled differently on the same issue, requiring in-depth research and interpretation of primary authority. Additionally, students were exposed to differing outcomes based on entity type.</p>
<p>We provide discussion of our multiple implementations and student questionnaire results to support the efficacy of our approach. We prepared resources to help instructors implement this pedagogical approach, including a completed data analysis, supporting summary tables, and an in-depth discussion of the primary authority related to reasonable compensation.</p>

We also analyze a sample of 71 articles from early research, 2004 through 2018. Within the combined sample we find three common methods for operationalizing the restatement variable: announcement date (AD), first occurrence (FO), and all occurrences (AO). <br><br>Analyzing the research question(s) examined in articles and the operationalization method employed, we inductively develop guidelines that encapsulate the logic applied in choosing the appropriate measurement approach. We find that that a noticeable subset of the 2004-2018 sample (9.86%) did not select the proper operationalization approach. However, 47 of 48 articles (97.92%) in the 2019-2021 period use the appropriate restatement method. Of the 119 combined articles, 89.1% explain why their research operationalization method fits with their research question. However, only 11.8% provide a satisfactorily complete discussion of how they operationalized the restatement variable. <br><br>We replicate a recently published article using all three restatement measurement methods and find that the choice made altered both the significance and sign of several of multiple predictor variables.

In this study we provide evidence through the lens of tax and capital market consequences. Specifically, we examine the impact of leasing accounting standard-ASC 842 on market participant reaction from the tax perspective concerning implementation from 2016 to 2021. Using difference-in-difference analyses, we find that relative to control firms, treatment firms report higher temporary book-tax differences and experience greater market uncertainty. We show that the increase in market uncertainty among treatment firms is driven mainly by the increase in book-tax differences.

Many audit firms have started offering ESG audits, which both assess a company’s exposure to ESG related risks and evaluate the accuracy of a company’s ESG disclosures. While there have been many articles that focus on the environment and social aspects of ESG our article helps company managers reconsider their governance systems so that they align with a broader range of shareholders and those shareholders’ interests, as well as other stakeholders’ interests. An organization’s goals, as well as the resources that they have available, will affect their governance system. There is not a one-size fits all solution to corporate governance, and each organization will have to consider the costs and benefits of the different processes and mechanisms available to them in order to find the right combination for their organization

We identified the two most common causes for those restatements and the accounting and tax regulations related to the underlying transactions described in the disclosure. We identified firms that restated their financial statements due to improper recording of deferred taxes related to indefinite-lived intangibles acquired in mergers and acquisitions and mishandling of deferred tax assets and liabilities on indefinite-lived intangibles in determination of the valuation allowance. An indefinite-lived intangible asset under U.S. accounting principles is one that does not have a legal or contractual limit on its life and in which the useful life is deemed to extend beyond the foreseeable future after obsolescence and other limiting factors are taken into consideration. Examples of indefinite-lived intangible assets include goodwill, trademarks, and some renewable licenses and franchises. <br><br>We created a “lessons learned” for firm managers and tax professionals designed to help eliminate the mishandling of complex transactions in financial disclosures.<br><br>This article received the 2015 Lybrand best article award from the Institute of Management Accountants.<br><em><br>Strategic Finance </em>is classified as a “High Quality” Publication by the Accounting Department.<br><br>In the Accounting literature article authors are listed in alphabetical order when the authors’ contributions are relatively equal.",Mollie Adams (Role:Author); Michele D Meckfessel (Role:Author); Kerry Inger (Role:Author),No,Basic or Discovery Scholarship,Blind Peer Reviewed,International,None,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Co-author,,Manuscript development; data analysis; manscript writing,,,English,This article received the 2015 Lybrand best article award from the Institute of Management Accountants.,Self-reported,2.0
Michele,Meckfessel,An Examination of the Impact of Tax Avoidance on the Readability of Tax Footnotes,Journal of the American Taxation Association,11/1/2017,2017.0,32,81-99,4,,Completed/Published,,,,,Fall,2017,"<p><br>(R) In this article, we examine the information provided to stakeholders in the tax footnote in the context of readability. The tax footnote is an interesting disclosure to examine because tax reporting requires bridging a vast volume of tax law with financial accounting principles (under ASC 740) and tax returns are proprietary leaving the tax footnote as one of the only public sources of information.</p>
<p>Our paper extends the literature on qualitative disclosures by examining an important firm disclosure, the tax footnote, in isolation.  Additionally, we provide insight into the tax information provided to stakeholders by developing a model of the determinants of tax footnote readability. We find that for firms with relatively low tax avoidance, there is a positive association between tax avoidance and tax footnote readability. In contrast, we find that for firms with relatively high tax avoidance, there is a negative association between tax avoidance and tax footnote readability, consistent with managers concealing information from the tax authority. Our results suggest a firm’s level of tax avoidance creates differing incentives for managers’ disclosure choices.</p>
<p>We extend our analysis to examine whether tax footnote readability impacts investor valuation of tax avoidance. In a model of the association between firm value and tax avoidance, we find investors positively value tax avoidance when tax footnotes are straightforward and firms have relatively low levels of tax avoidance.</p>
<p>Finally, we develop a systematic method of extracting the tax footnote from the 10-K filing. Our data collection method is a combination of approaches, beginning with XBRL extraction (most accurate and efficient) whenever possible, extending to collecting textual filings (moderately accurate and efficient) and finally to manual extraction (accurate but inefficient) when necessary. Our method formalizes and, when possible, automates the complex and time-consuming process of tax footnote extraction for large data samples.</p>

Second, authors that have cited Dr. Hunton’s work in their research are encouraged to review their work to determine whether it relied on findings in a retracted paper such that their subsequent findings could be called into question.  Third, authors are encouraged to add to their initial literature review process a step to verify that none of the papers they are citing have been retracted.  Finally, the article encourages authors to develop alternative ways to provide evidence regarding the research questions addressed in retracted papers in the literature to further restore the literature.   <em>Research in Accounting Regulation </em>is classified as a “High Quality” Publication by the Accounting Department and as a “B” on the Australian Business Deans Council (ABDC) Journal Quality List.<br><br>In the Accounting literature article authors are typically listed in alphabetical order when the authors’ contributions are relatively equal.",Stephen R Moehrle (Role:Author); Michele D Meckfessel (Role:Author),Yes,Basic or Discovery Scholarship,Blind Peer Reviewed,International,None,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Lead / Corresponding author,,Manuscript writing; responding to review comments,,,English,,Self-reported,6.0

<p>For this tax research case we created “The Not So Pokey Hokies,” a running club based on real people that participate in a wide range of running activities including charitable race participation, not-for-profit running organization management, nationally competitive racing, pacing, competitive team membership, coaching and collegiate sports. This case requires students to identify tax issues related to the club members’ running activities and address the issues using tax research skills. The modular nature of the case allows the instructor to assign specific tax issues or entire scenarios, depending on the nature of the class. As the students complete the case, they are required to use critical thinking to identify the issues and build tax research skills to address the issues. In addition, students gain technical knowledge through exposure to a variety of tax concepts and communication skills through completion of a written analysis of the case. To add to the realism of the case, we created a website <a href=""http://www.notsopokeyhokies.com"">www.notsopokeyhokies.com</a> with all of the runner profiles available for student download. <br><br><em>Issues in Accounting Education</em> is classified as a “High Quality” publication by the Accounting Department and as an “A” on the Australian Business Deans Council (ABDC) Journal Quality List.</p>

This paper explores the question: Does the regrowth of sizable consulting practices by the Big 4 influence audit reporting lag and restatement rates? <br><br>The data presented supports the concern that Big 4 audit practices are not immune to the presence of large consulting practices within the same firm. We find that consulting practice size has a positive and statistically significant influence on audit reporting lag and restatement rate. <br><br>Prior empirical scope-of-services research has focused on conflict of interest as a risk to audit quality, with mixed results. The uniqueness of this paper is in our exploration of the theorized impact of loss of professional focus on audit quality. Also by utilizing the 2000-2009 sample period the paper examines a dynamic timeframe encompassing the divesture and the regrowth of Big 4 accounting firm consulting practices and concurrent implementation of SOX scope-of-service restrictions.<br><em><br>Managerial Auditing Journal</em> is classified as a “High Quality” Publication by the Accounting Department as an “A” on the Australian Business Deans Council (ABDC) Journal Quality List.<br><br>Downloads: 4140 (According to Emerald Publishing).

We predict and find that obfuscation of tax avoidance increases the likelihood of incurring a subsequent tax-related restatement. We predict an asymmetric response to a restatement announcement depending upon the level of tax avoidance before the restatement.</p>
<p>Specifically, we document an increase in tax avoidance for firms that have relatively low tax avoidance prior to the restatement event, which we attribute to improved governance leading firms to a more optimal level of tax avoidance. Conversely, we document a decline in tax avoidance for firms that have relatively high tax avoidance prior to the restatement event, consistent with improved governance leading firms to a more optimal level of tax avoidance and increased perceived scrutiny from the tax authority constraining tax avoidance.</p>

As of January 2023, ChatGPT provides correct answers for 56.5 percent of questions and partially correct answers for an additional 9.4 percent of questions. When considering point values for questions, students significantly outperform ChatGPT with a 76.7 percent average on assessments compared to 47.5 percent for ChatGPT if no partial credit is awarded and 56.5 percent if partial credit is awarded. Still, ChatGPT performs better than the student average for 15.8 percent of assessments when we include partial credit.

Using the ability-motivation-opportunity (AMO) perspective we conceptualize IHC as ability, collaborative climate as motivation, and the firm's level of internationalization as opportunity. We test three alternative AMO models - the additive model (main effect), the combinative model (two-way interactions), and the multiplicative model (a three-way interaction). Using a cross-industry sample of South Korean firms, we find support for the multiplicative model. Specifically, the relationship between IHC enhancement practices and firm performance is significant and positive only when both collaborative climate and internationalization are high.

Drawing from a sample of Fortune 300 firms, we uncover two mechanisms through which community influential directors impact a firm’s CSP. Our findings show that both interlocks with socially-oriented organizations, such as non-profit, community, or educational organizations (NGOs), as well as interlocks with firms highly ranked in CSP, mediate the relationship between the percentage of community influential directors on the board and the firm’s CSP. Furthermore, we compared the strength of these two effects and found that the mediating effect of interlock ties with high-CSP firms is stronger than the mediating effect of interlock ties with NGOs.

The increased power through serving at the top over time enables CEOs to block significant organizational change such as asset divestitures even when the situation warrants. However, managerial power is complex and multi-dimensional, as power can be formed through a CEO’s structural position, prestige/social influence, equity ownership, and expertise. Our study provides a more nuanced perspective by examining how different forms of power may serve as intervening mechanisms that decouple or promote long-tenured CEOs’ strategic CSQ toward firm assets. Our results show that increased structural (duality) and ownership (stock holdings) power and decreased expert power (firm performance decline) will mitigate long-tenured CEOs’ aversion to organizational change, as reflected in more divestiture activities. We also find that CEOs’ prestige power (breadth of external board ties) and expert power (past divestiture experience) positively impact firm divestiture activity, regardless of CEO tenure. Our study contributes to the literatures on strategic change, power and CSQ by providing novel insights into the link between the multifaceted role of power and executives’ strategic choice during critical corporate change events.

In this study, we investigate the age and gender-related differences in patenting for technology entrepreneurs. We draw on upper echelons and generational arguments to theorize that there is a curvilinear association between new venture founders’ age and patenting, with distinct moderating effects based on gender. Leveraging a global sample of 2848 new technology ventures across several industries, our analysis broadly supports the hypotheses and provides empirical evidence of the powerful role of age and gender in shaping innovation outcomes for new technology ventures.

Seemantini,Pathak,The impact of firm-advisor ties on corporate post-divestiture performance,Journal of Business Research,,2020.0,,,,,Completed/Published,,,,,Fall,2020,"Abstract: The important role of financial advisors in corporate divestiture is widely recognized; however, their impact on firm performance is underexplored. Our study examines three aspects (the number, task relevance, and exclusivity) of firm-advisor ties in predicting firms’ post-divestiture performance. We theorize that relationship-related learning from greater numbers of prior firm-advisor ties and task-related learning from higher task relevance in those ties contribute to stronger post-divestiture performance. These positive effects are amplified in divesting firms facing financial decline. However, the exclusivity of firm-advisor ties can be a double-edged sword, showing a curvilinear impact on performance. This study contributes to our understanding by demonstrating that divesting firms benefit from having a familiar advisor when prior ties are contextually relevant, but not necessarily exclusive, and firms’ financial condition can modify those relationships.

While the conventional view suggests that more changes are likely to occur in firms led by new outside CEOs, recent evidence shows that outside successors often face challenges in affecting changes due to their lack of firm-specific knowledge. Our paper examines how CEO successor origin leads to variations in firms' strategic orientations during portfolio restructuring. Through investigating two dimensions of strategic change in restructuring, we demonstrate that new inside CEOs are associated with a greater scale of divestiture, whereas new outside CEOs are associated with a greater scope change through divestiture. Our results, based on 234 divestiture programs in the United States between 1986 and 2009 demonstrate that both new inside and outside CEOs can affect the changes in restructuring firms, albeit in different ways, depending on the scale and scope change following a divestiture program.

We propose that the impact of gender composition in new venture teams (NVTs) on commercialization of social ventures is contingent on the strength of cultural norms of a nation. Our view of gender as a culture-contingent resource reveals ordering mechanisms that distinguish gender effects in culturally tight versus culturally loose societies with respect to commercialization intent and legal form. The empirical analysis of an international sample of 6657 social ventures from 30 countries supports the study hypotheses. The findings show that gender differences in new ventures are more significant in tight societies compared to loose societies.

As a result, some firms created chief diversity officer (CDO) positions to manage workforce diversity. This study takes a multitheoretic approach, drawing upon institutional, resource dependence, and upper echelons theories to explain firms' adoptions of this key position. Using Cox event history analyses based on a sample of S&P 500 firms, we find that, from an institutional theory perspective, firms are more likely to adopt CDOs when they are headquartered in legalized gay marriage states and the accumulative number of industry CDO adoptions is high. From a resource dependence perspective, we find that firm innovation intensity, diversification levels, transient institutional ownership, and industry female and African American employment bases can predict firms' adoptions of CDO positions. From an upper echelons explanation, we find that female top management team representation is positively associated with firms' adoptions of CDO positions.

Sandra,Langeslag,(R) Down-regulation of love feelings after a romantic break-up: Self-report and electrophysiological data,Journal of Experimental Psychology: General,,2018.0,147,720-733,,,Completed/Published,,,,,Spring,2018,"Because remaining love feelings for an ex-partner are negatively associated with recovery from a romantic break-up, it may be helpful to decrease those love feelings. Love regulation is the use of behavioral or cognitive strategies to change the intensity of current feelings of romantic love. This study
evaluated three regulation strategies: (1) negative reappraisal of the ex-partner, (2) reappraisal of love feelings, and (3) distraction. It was tested how these regulation strategies change love feelings for the ex-partner, valence of affect, and motivated attention for the ex-partner. Participants who were upset
about a romantic break-up performed these regulation strategies before passively viewing a picture of their ex-partner, during which their electroencephalogram was recorded. Negative reappraisal decreased
love feelings and made participants feel more unpleasant. Love reappraisal did not change how in love or pleasant/unpleasant participants felt. Distraction did not change love feelings but made participants feel more pleasant. This suggests that in the context of a romantic break-up, negative reappraisal is an
effective love down-regulation strategy, whereas distraction is an effective positive emotion up-regulation strategy. Furthermore, all three strategies decreased motivated attention for the ex-partner, as indicated by a reduced amplitude of the late positive potential. This reduced motivated attention for the ex-partner could make it easier to deal with encounters of (reminders of) the ex-partner. Love regulation is a promising phenomenon with important everyday life and clinical implications.

Sandra,Langeslag,(R) Early visual processing of snakes and angry faces: An ERP study,Brain Research,,2018.0,1678,297-303,,,Completed/Published,,,,,Fall,2017,"Snakes and angry faces are common fear stimuli and both elicit an Early Posterior Negativity (EPN) in the event-related potential, which indicates that they capture early automatic visual attention. But because snakes have been a predatory threat for primates since long before communication through facial expressions evolved, we tested the hypothesis that the EPN for snakes would be more pronounced than the EPN for angry faces. We carefully controlled for differences between reptiles and faces by using lizards and neutral faces as control stimuli. Participants viewed a rapid serial visual presentation of snakes (i.e., threatening reptiles), lizards (i.e., non-threatening reptiles), angry faces (i.e., threatening humans), and neutral faces (i.e., non-threatening humans). EPNs for snakes (vs. lizards) and angry (vs. neutral) faces started to develop around 120 ms after stimulus onset. The EPN was of the same size for snakes and angry faces between 150–225 ms, but was larger for snakes than for angry faces between 225–300 ms, which suggests that snakes capture more extensive early automatic attention than angry faces. These findings
correspond with the notion that the visual system is specifically tuned to detect snakes because of the prolonged pressure of snakes on primate evolution.

Sandra,Langeslag,"(R) Regulation of romantic love feelings: Preconceptions, strategies, and feasibility",PLOS ONE,,2016.0,11,e0161087,,,Completed/Published,,,,,Summer,2016,"Love feelings can be more intense than desired (e.g., after a break-up) or less intense than desired (e.g., in long-term relationships). If only we could control our love feelings! We present the concept of explicit love regulation, which we define as the use of behavioral and cognitive strategies to change the intensity of current feelings of romantic love. We present the first two studies on preconceptions about, strategies for, and the feasibility of love regulation.
Questionnaire responses showed that people perceive love feelings as somewhat uncontrollable. Still, in four open questions people reported to use strategies such as cognitive reappraisal, distraction, avoidance, and undertaking (new) activities to cope with break-ups, to maintain long-term relationships, and to regulate love feelings. Instructed up-regulation of love using reappraisal increased subjective feelings of attachment, while
love down-regulation decreased subjective feelings of infatuation and attachment. We used the late positive potential (LPP) amplitude as an objective index of regulation success. Instructed love up-regulation enhanced the LPP between 300–400 ms in participants who were involved in a relationship and in participants who had recently experienced a romantic
break-up, while love down-regulation reduced the LPP between 700–3000 ms in participants who were involved in a relationship. These findings corroborate the self-reported feasibility of love regulation, although they are complicated by the finding that love up-regulation also reduced the LPP between 700–3000 ms in participants who were involved in a relationship. To conclude, although people have the preconception that love feelings are uncontrollable, we show for the first time that intentional regulation of love feelings using reappraisal, and perhaps other strategies, is feasible. Love regulation will benefit individuals and society because it could enhance positive effects and reduce negative effects of romantic love.

By assessing deception in low- and high-risk conditions, we differentiated between children displaying some dishonesty and children who deceived repeatedly, and we assessed the correlates of deception in 163 children. A large majority of the children were deceptive in the low-risk condition (n = 121, 74.2%), but most children refrained from deception when at risk for getting caught (69 of 121). Using an aggregate score, children who continued deceiving could be discriminated from other children based on gender, lower age, lower IQ, less effortful control, and lower educated mothers. Compared with honest children and high-risk deceivers, low-risk deceivers differed on an aggregate score, suggesting that they were more likely to be girls and to come from higher income families. Compared with the other children, high-risk deceivers showed decreased activation in the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and right frontal pole during the low-risk condition, suggesting decreased engagement in conflict monitoring and error detection during opportunities for deception. In high-risk deceivers, high-risk deception was associated with increased bilateral
ACC and right paracingulate gyrus activation compared with lowrisk deception. High-risk deceivers may require a higher level of risk to engage the ACC to the same degree as low-risk deceivers or honest children. Our results suggest that deceptive behavior in children seems to be largely dependent on the estimated likelihood of getting caught. High-risk deceivers form a distinct group with
different cognitive and neurobiological characteristics compared with honest children and low-risk deceivers.

Sandra,Langeslag,(R) Cognitive reappraisal of snake and spider pictures: An event-related potentials study,International Journal of Psychophysiology,,2018.0,130,8-Jan,,,Completed/Published,,,,,Summer,2018,"Fear of snakes and spiders are common animal phobias. Emotion regulation can change the response to emotional stimuli, including snakes and spiders. It is well known that emotion regulation modulates the late positive potential (LPP), which reflects sustained motivated attention. However, research concerning the effect of emotion regulation on the early posterior negativity (EPN), which reflects early selective attention, is scarce. The present research question was whether the EPN and LPP amplitudes are modulated by regulation of emotional responses to snake and spider stimuli. Emotion up- and down-regulation were expected to enhance and reduce the LPP amplitude, respectively, but emotion regulation was not expected to modulate the EPN amplitude. Female participants passively viewed snake, spider, and bird pictures, and up- and down-regulated their emotional responses to the snake and spider pictures using self-focused reappraisal, while their electroencephalogram was recorded. There were EPNs for snakes and spiders vs. birds, as well as for snakes vs. spiders. The LPP amplitude tended to be enhanced for snakes and spiders compared to birds. Most importantly, the LPP
amplitude was larger in the up-regulate than in the down-regulate condition for both snakes and spiders, but there was no evidence that the EPN amplitude was modulated by emotion regulation. This suggests that emotion regulation modulated sustained motivated attention, but not early selective attention, to snakes and spiders. The findings are in line with the notion that the emotional modulation of the EPN is more automatic than the emotional modulation of the LPP.

Sandra,Langeslag,(R) Cognitive control in romantic love: The roles of infatuation and attachment in interference and adaptive cognitive control,Cognition and Emotion,,2020.0,34,596-603,,,Completed/Published,,,,,Spring,2020,"Besides physiological, behavioural, and affective effects, romantic love also has cognitive effects. In this study, we tested (1) whether individual differences in infatuation and/or attachment level predict impaired interference control even in the absence of a love booster procedure, and (2) whether individual differences in attachment level predict reduced adaptive cognitive control as measured by conflict adaptation and post-error slowing. Eighty-three young adults who had recently fallen in love completed a Stroop-like task, which yielded reliable indices of interference control (i.e. the interference effect) and adaptive cognitive control (i.e. conflict adaptation and post-error slowing). We did not observe the predicted negative association between infatuation or attachment level and interference control. It might be that reduced interference control with love only happens when people are actively thinking about their beloved. In addition, we observed only weak evidence for the prediction that attachment level is associated with reduced conflict adaption. The results did show, however, that attachment level is associated with less post-error slowing, which is in line with the notion that attachment to a romantic partner buffers against aversive events. Our findings suggest that attachment is associated with reduced adaptive cognitive control, which could have
implications in everyday life.

We tested whether the beloved captures early automatic attention, as indicated by an early posterior negativity (EPN) in a typical rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) task, while replicating previous findings that the beloved receives sustained motivated attention, as indicated by an enhanced late positive potential (LPP) in a standard passive viewing task. Participants viewed beloved, friend, and stranger pictures in RSVP and standard passive viewing tasks. Participants felt most pleasant and aroused while viewing beloved pictures. In the RSVP task, there was a left lateral parietal EPN for the beloved (vs. friend and stranger) between 225 and 300 ms. In the standard passive viewing task, the midline centroparietal LPP between
400 and 1000 ms was larger in response to the beloved than friend and stranger. So, the beloved captures early automatic attention as well as sustained motivated attention, likely because they are evolutionarily significant.

Sandra,Langeslag,(R) The effect of fearful expressions on recognition memory for faces: Behavioral and electrophysiological data,International Journal of Psychophysiology,,2020.0,152,53-61,,,Completed/Published,,,,,Spring,2020,"Facial expressions affect memory for face identity. We tested how fearful expressions modulate recognition memory for faces. In two studies, participants completed a continuous recognition task with fearful and neutral
faces while their electroencephalogram was recorded. Each face stimulus was presented twice and participants were instructed to indicate whether it was presented for the first (‘new’) or second time (‘old’). The false alarm
rate was higher for fearful than neutral faces, which is opposite to the emotion enhancement effect on memory but in line with the liberal response bias for emotional information. There was no evidence of emotional modulation of the N400 old/new effect, which suggests that the sense of familiarity was not affected by fearful facial expressions. The LPC old/new effect, however, was modulated by facial expression, as it was absent for fearful faces because of a greater positivity in response to new fearful than new neutral faces. This LPC old/new effect finding may reflect that the emotional salience of fearful new faces is mistaken for a sense of recollection, resulting in an increased false alarm rate. In short, people seem more likely to (mistakenly) think that they have encountered a person before when the person looks scared compared to non-emotional, which has relevance for daily life and forensic situations such as police lineups.

Sandra,Langeslag,(R) The effect of mouth opening in emotional faces on subjective experience and the early posterior negativity amplitude,Brain and Cognition,,2018.0,127,51-59,,,Completed/Published,,,,,Fall,2018,"Previous studies have examined the role of the eye region in emotional expressions, but the mouth region is understudied. The main goal of this study was to examine how mouth opening in emotional faces affects subjective
experience and early automatic attentional capture, as measured by the early posterior negativity (EPN) amplitude. Participants in two studies viewed angry, happy, and neutral faces with mouths open and closed while their electroencephalogram was recorded. Afterwards, participants indicated how unpleasant-pleasant (i.e., valence) and calming-arousing (i.e., arousal) each face made them feel. Angry and happy faces (and neutral faces to a lesser extent) with an open vs. closed mouth made observers feel more extreme valence and arousal. In addition, there generally was an EPN for angry and happy faces (and neutral faces to a lesser extent) with open vs. closed mouths, which suggests that emotional expressions with an open mouth capture early automatic attention more than expressions with a closed mouth. Finally, the effects of mouth opening were somewhat modulated by face gender, but not by observer gender. The current findings contribute to our knowledge of
facial expressions and social interaction, but also have relevance for the growing fields of social robotics and digital animation.

We tested whether positively reappraising the spouse and/or up-regulating positive emotions in general increases love feelings for the spouse, marital satisfaction, and motivated attention to the spouse as measured by the late positive potential (LPP). Married individuals viewed spouse, pleasant, and neutral pictures, and thought about positive aspects of their spouse or interpreted pleasant pictures more positively. Event-related potentials were recorded, and self-reported infatuation, attachment, and marital satisfaction were assessed. Viewing spouse pictures increased infatuation, attachment, and marital satisfaction compared to viewing pleasant or neutral pictures. Motivated attention, measured using the LPP amplitude, was greatest to spouse, intermediate to pleasant, and smallest to neutral pictures. Although positively reappraising the pleasant pictures increased the LPP and hence increased motivated attention even further, positively reappraising the spouse did not. This study indicates that love and marital satisfaction increase even by just viewing the spouse, which can be used to stabilize marriages.

Negative reappraisal was expected to reduce love, increase unpleasantness, reduce upsetness about the break-up, and reduce motivated attention to the ex-partner as measured by the late positive potential (LPP) compared to positive reappraisal. In this study, twenty-four participants who were upset about a break-up viewed pictures of their ex-partner in two reappraisal conditions and a no reappraisal condition. In the negative reappraisal condition, participants thought about negative aspects of their ex-partner. In the positive reappraisal condition, participants thought about positive aspects of the situation. Subsequently, participants viewed ex-partner pictures and the LPP was measured. Participants rated infatuation, attachment, valence, and upsetness about the break-up. Even though numerical differences were in line with our hypotheses, we found no evidence of significant differences between conditions for infatuation, attachment, valence, upsetness, or LPP amplitude in the preregistered analyses.

Sandra,Langeslag,(R) The effect of arousal on regulation of negative emotions using cognitive reappraisal: An ERP study,International Journal of Psychophysiology,,2017.0,118,18-26,,,Completed/Published,,,,,Summer,2017,"Because the effectiveness of the emotion regulation strategy cognitive reappraisal may vary with emotion intensity, we investigated how stimulus arousal affects reappraisal success. Participants up- and down-regulated
emotional responses using cognitive reappraisal to low and high arousing unpleasant pictures while the electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Up-regulation resulted in more negative self-reported valence, while down-regulation resulted in less negative self-reported valence regardless of stimulus arousal, suggesting that subjective reappraisal success does not vary with emotional intensity. Participants felt that down-regulation of emotional responses to low arousing unpleasant pictures was easiest, which is in line with previous findings that participants showed a greater preference for reappraisal in low than high arousing situations. The late positive
potential (LPP) amplitude was enhanced by down-regulation of high arousing unpleasant pictures. Even though this effect was unexpected and is opposite to the typical effect of down-regulation on the LPP, it is in line with several previous studies. Potential explanations for LPP regulation effects in the unexpected direction, such as strategy selection and task design, are evaluated. Suggestions and recommendations for future research are
discussed, including using trial-by-trial manipulation of regulation instructions and studying the effect of stimulus arousal on up- and down-regulation of positive emotions.

Sandra,Langeslag,(R) Preferential processing of task-irrelevant beloved-related information and task performance: Two event-related potential studies,Neuropsychologia,,2020.0,145,106497,,,Completed/Published,,,,,Summer,2020,"People who are in love have better attention for beloved-related information, but report having trouble focusing on other tasks, such as (home)work. So, romantic love can both improve and hurt cognition. Emotional information
is preferentially processed, which improves task performance when the information is task-relevant, but hurts task performance when it is task-irrelevant. Because beloved-related information is highly emotional,
the effects of romantic love on cognition may resemble these effects of emotion on cognition. We examined whether beloved-related information is preferentially processed even when it is task-irrelevant and whether this
hurts task performance. In two event-related potential studies, participants who had recently fallen in love performed a visuospatial short-term memory task. Task-irrelevant beloved, friend, and stranger faces were presented during maintenance (Study 1), or encoding (Study 2). The Early Posterior Negativity (EPN) reflecting early automatic attentional capturing and the Late Positive Potential (LPP) reflecting sustained motivated attention were largest for beloved pictures. Thus, beloved pictures are preferentially processed even when they are task-irrelevant. Task performance and reaction times did not differ between beloved, friend, and stranger conditions. Nevertheless, self-reported obsessive thinking about the beloved tended to correlate negatively with task performance, and positively with reaction times, across conditions. So, although task-irrelevant beloved-related information does not impact task performance, more obsessive thinking about the beloved might relate to
poorer and slower overall task performance. More research is needed to clarify why people experience trouble focusing on beloved-unrelated tasks and how this negative effect of love on cognition could be reduced.

Sandra,Langeslag,(R) Perceived ability to regulate love,PLOS ONE,,2019.0,14,e0216523,,,Completed/Published,,,,,Spring,2019,"Research has shown that romantic love can be regulated. We investigated perceptions about love regulation, because these perceptions may impact mental health and influence love regulation application. Two-hundred eighty-six participants completed a series of items online via Qualtrics that assessed perceived ability to up- and down-regulate, exaggerate and suppress the expression of, and start and stop different love types. We also tested individual
differences in perceived love regulation ability. Participants thought that they could up- but not down-regulate love in general and that they could up-regulate love in general more than down-regulate it. Participants thought that they could up-regulate infatuation less than attachment and sexual desire. Participants also thought that they could exaggerate and suppress expressions of infatuation, attachment, and sexual desire, but that they could not start and stop infatuation and attachment, or start sexual desire. The more participants
habitually used cognitive reappraisal, the more they thought that they could up- and down-regulate infatuation and attachment and up-regulate sexual desire. The more participants were infatuated with their beloved, the more they thought that they could up- but not down-regulate infatuation, attachment, and sexual desire. Finally, participants thought that they could up- and down-regulate happiness more than infatuation These findings are a first step
toward the development of psychoeducation techniques to correct inaccurate love regulation perceptions, which may improve mental health and love regulation in daily life.

Participants passively viewed organized, slightly disorganized, totally disorganized, and control pictures while their electroencephalogram was recorded. They also rated the valence and arousal elicited by each picture and completed questionnaires assessing desire for order and organization behavior. Organized pictures made participants feel most pleasant, control pictures made participants feel less pleasant, slightly disorganized pictures made participants feel even less pleasant, and totally disorganized pictures made participants feel least pleasant. There were no significant effects on arousal. Totally disorganized pictures elicited a frontal negativity in the ERP between 200±2000 ms after stimulus onset, which might reflect inhibition of rearranging
behavior. Individual differences in desire for order and organization behavior did not correlate with valence, arousal, or the frontal negativity. The current study design and findings could be a starting point for examining the differences between adaptive and maladaptive preferences for organization and aversions to disorganization.

Cardiac and Electrocortical Concomitants of Romantic Interest and Rejection,Biological Psychology,,2019.0,146,107707,,,Completed/Published,,,,,Summer,2019,"Online dating has become a very popular way to find a romantic partner. In the present study, we examined whether romantic interest and rejection in such a setting would evoke differential electrocortical and cardiac responses. For this purpose a database was created, similar to a dating website, where the participants’ personal information and photos were placed. Heterosexual, single participants (N=61) evaluated the profiles of opposite-sex potential romantic partners and decided whether they would like to date this person or not. Subsequently, participants passively viewed (34 analyzable volunteers participated in the EEG session; 10 male; mean age=20) the pictures of the potential partners together with their own judgment about the “dateability”
of the potential partner, and the potential partner’s judgment of the “dateability” of the participant. After viewing the pictures participants received the email addresses to contact their matches. Electrocortical and cardiac responses to these “match” or “non-match” judgments were measured. A significantly larger P3 response was found when participants received a positive evaluation as compared to negative evaluations. This is in line with an explanation in terms of reward. A significantly larger cardiac deceleration was found when participants received a negative evaluation as compared to positive evaluations, which is in line with an explanation in terms of social pain. Findings are discussed in terms of activation of different parts of the anterior cingulate cortex.

This increases the care burden of health care providers during times when the governmental structure may be overwhelmed or functioning in a less than optimal manner. Beginning with the death of Michael Brown, civil unrest over the last 2 years has necessitated a closer examination of the role nurse leaders play in preparing their staff and facilities for potential results of this civil unrest. The similarities between the results of rioting and violence and natural disaster are obvious, but the differences are significant.

Acquisition of new traits can be achieved through horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Here, we investigate drivers that promote or deter the maintenance of HGT-driven degeneracy, occurring when processes accomplish identical functions through nonidentical components. Subsequent evolution can optimize newly acquired functions; for example, beneficial alleles identified in an engineered Methylorubrum extorquens strain allowed it to utilize a ""Foreign"" formaldehyde oxidation pathway substituted for its Native pathway for methylotrophic growth. We examined the fitness consequences of interactions between these alleles when they were combined with the Native pathway or both (Dual) pathways. Unlike the Foreign pathway context where they evolved, these alleles were often neutral or deleterious when moved into these alternative genetic backgrounds. However, there were instances where combinations of multiple alleles resulted in higher fitness outcomes than individual allelic substitutions could provide. Importantly, the genetic context accompanying these allelic substitutions significantly altered the fitness landscape, shifting local fitness peaks and restricting the set of accessible evolutionary trajectories. These findings highlight how genetic context can negatively impact the probability of maintaining native and HGT-introduced functions together, making it difficult for degeneracy to evolve. However, in cases where the cost of maintaining degeneracy was mitigated by adding evolved alleles impacting the function of these pathways, we observed rare opportunities for pathway coevolution to occur. Together, our results highlight the importance of genetic context and resulting epistasis in retaining or losing HGT-acquired degenerate functions.",José I Rojas Echenique; Caleb J Renshaw; Lon M Chubiz; Nora V Espericueta; Jeremy A Draghi; Christopher J Marx; Eric L Bruger,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,,,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Synonymous mutations are typically silent. In this study, we show that synonymous mutations can be highly beneficial and rapidly fixed in evolving populations. Using codon-optimized, codon-randomized versions of a key gene gene in the central carbon metabolism of Methylobacterium extorquens, we found that, independent of codon optimality, synonymous mutations in this gene resulted in improved growth and were rapidly fixed in experimentally evolving populations. Experiments were conceived and designed by D. Agashe and C.J. Marx. I provided significant technical assistance in production of materials to conduct the experiments and aided in data analysis. These materials were prepared prior to my arrival to UMSL. DA drafted the manuscript that was edited by DA, CJM, and me following my arrival to UMSL. Submission and revision were handled by DA.

The sample included 130 preterm infants and their mothers observed in a feeding interaction in the NICU. Dyads were observed through 36 months postterm. Observed maternal positive affective involvement and verbalizations in the NICU were associated with the same parenting behaviors at 24 months, social support, socioeconomic status, and being born in the late preterm period. Maternal negative affect and behavior were unrelated to later maternal negativity or child and maternal characteristics. Positive parenting assessed in the NICU appears related to later parenting interaction quality, suggesting early assessment is possible. Maternal negative affect and behavior towards children may not consistently emerge until later in development.

However, this association has not been well studied in infancy or toddlerhood, and prospective mediators have not been thoroughly explored. This prospective, longitudinal study utilized two transactional models to examine bidirectional relations between parenting stress and children’s behavior problems and explore perceived family conflict and parental supportiveness as potential mediators. Data were taken from the Early Head Start Family and Child Experiences Study, where 835 parent–child dyads were assessed at 1, 2, and 3 years. Parenting stress and behavior problems were measured at all 3 time points, while family conflict and observed parental supportiveness were measured at ages 2 and 3. Results indicated that parenting stress and children’s behavior problems were relatively stable over time and had bidirectional or cross-lagged associations. Family conflict mediated the relation between children’s behavior problems at age 1 and parenting stress at age 3, while parental supportiveness mediated the relation between parenting stress at age 1 and behavior problems at age 3, suggesting both “child” and “parent” effects that function through two different mechanisms. These findings suggest that early prevention programs should focus on both children’s behavior and parenting stress in the first year and work to reduce family conflict and increase parental supportiveness in order to disrupt this negative cycle. My role included conceptualization, data analysis, manuscript preparation, and supervision.

One potential pathway is postnatal parental depression. The authors assessed depressive symptoms in mothers and fathers after preterm birth, and identified the impacts of both prematurity and parental depressive symptoms on children’s early cognitive function. Data were from the nationally representative Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Birth Cohort (n=5350). Depressive symptoms were assessed at 9 months and children’s cognitive function at 24 months. Weighted generalized estimating equation models examined the extent to which preterm birth, and mothers’ and fathers’ postnatal depressive symptoms impacted children’s cognitive function at 24 months, and whether the association between preterm birth and 24-month cognitive function was mediated by parental depressive symptoms. At 9 months, fathers of very preterm (<32 weeks gestation) and moderate/late preterm (32-37 weeks gestation) infants had higher CESD scores than fathers of term-born (≥37 weeks gestation) infants; preterm birth was not associated with maternal depressive symptoms. In multivariable analyses, preterm birth was associated with lower cognitive function at 24 months; this association was unaffected by adjustment for parental depressive symptoms. Fathers’, but not mothers’, postnatal depressive symptoms predicted lower cognitive function in the fully adjusted model. The national findings support early identification and treatment of fathers of preterm infants with depressive symptoms. My role on this project involved conceptualization and manuscript preparation.

The inclusion of evidence-based practices to address these challenges in the NICU has largely been based upon short-term improvements in parent and infant functioning. However, less is known regarding the extent to which family-based interventions may also be associated with longer-term parenting behaviors and children’s neurobehavioral outcomes. Comprehensive family-based NICU interventions demonstrate consistent links with later parental mental well-being, sensitive parenting behaviors, and children’s cognitive and socioemotional development. Dyadic co-regulation activities implemented inconsistently and/or in isolation to other components of NICU interventions show mixed associations with outcomes, highlighting the need for multifaceted wrap-around care. Further research is needed to delineate associations between NICU interventions and children’s neurological and language development, with follow-up beyond very early childhood in larger samples. Long-term associations may reflect the stability of early parental responses to NICU interventions and the extent to which parents continue to implement mental health and sensitive parenting techniques in the home. Remaining issues also concern the extent to which NICU interventions incorporate sociodemographic differences across families, and whether interventions are generalizable or feasible across hospitals. My role included conceptualization, literature review and manuscript preparation.

A sample of 173 mother-child dyads were followed from just before the infant was discharged from the neonatal intensive care unit to 6 years of age, with observational measurements of maternal insensitivity and child noncompliance (24 and 36 months), maternal self-reports of perceived parenting stress (24 months, 36 months, 6 years), and maternal reports of child externalizing behavior at 6 years. Results indicated that maternal insensitivity at 36 months significantly mediated the relation between parenting stress at 24 months and externalizing behaviors at 6 years. Parenting stress was also directly associated with child noncompliance at 36 months and with child externalizing behavior at 6 years. Neonatal risk was associated with increased maternal insensitivity at 24 months, but also decreased parenting stress at 24 months. No significant “child effects” from child behavior to either maternal insensitivity or parenting stress were found. Parenting stress appears to play a critical role for children born preterm, and it is associated with children’s behavior both directly and through its influence on parenting.

Person-centered approaches can help researchers, clinicians, and educators make more informed predictions about a child’s trajectory and provide tailored interventions specific to the child’s strengths and vulnerabilities. However, research has often focused on school-age children in low-risk samples. This study utilized a latent profile analysis (LPA) to create different profiles of 521 toddlers in Early Head Start across behavioral and language domains, and then examined individual, family, and socioeconomic predictors of profile. Data were drawn from the Early Head Start Family and Child Experiences Study, a nationally-representative, prospective, longitudinal study of children assessed at ages 1, 2, and 3. The LPA suggested five distinct profiles of development at age 3: children who were well-adjusted, children with language difficulties, children with parent-reported behavior problems, children with staff-reported behavior problems, and children with multiple difficulties. Among the patterns of risk and protective factors, those in the profile with multiple difficulties were most likely to have missed early developmental milestones at age 1. Those in the parent-reported behavior problems profile experienced less supportive and more negative parenting, greater chaos in the home, and had mothers with higher levels of depressive symptoms than those who were well-adjusted. Those in the language and multiple difficulties profiles experienced the highest level of sociodemographic risk. Overall, findings suggest unique patterns of risk factors for each profile, suggesting that interventions tailored to the unique needs of the family may be most beneficial.

However, the categories of coerced sexual experiences examined in most prior studies are somewhat limited. The present study evaluated cognitive and psychological outcomes associated with coerced sexual experiences as a function of the type of sexual act and coercive tactic experienced; a wide range of acts and tactics were considered. Participants (N = 402) completed an online survey about their worst or only coerced sexual experience, identifying the worst (or only) sexual act and coercive tactic that occurred. They completed measures of posttraumatic stress symptoms, depressive symptoms, anger, and negative trauma-related cognitions. Relationships between symptom severity and worst (or only) sexual act and coercive tactic, as well as number of acts and tactics, were analyzed. Results related to sexual act demonstrated that vaginal penetration and penetration of the other person’s vagina were associated with the most symptoms on several measures. Results related to coercive tactic demonstrated that sex obtained through anger/criticism and physical force were associated with the most symptoms on several measures. Additionally, experiencing a larger number of coercive tactics predicted more symptoms on all measures, whereas experiencing more sexual acts only explained unique variance in PTSD symptoms.

Emotion regulation skills are important across the lifespan for psychological and interpersonal functioning. Research on children’s emotion regulation skill development often examines parent socialization of emotion. However, this research has largely focused on mothers, neglecting fathers’ roles in emotionally socializing children. This is concerning because traditional Western masculine norms include restricted emotionality, toughness, invulnerability, and aggression. Fathers’ views on masculinity are likely to impact their parenting attitudes and behavior, and therefore relate to their socialization of children’s emotion regulation. Research and theory need to include fathers from a variety of cultural backgrounds and family constellations in order to better understand the relation between masculinity and fathering behavior, particularly fathers’ beliefs and behaviors toward socializing their children’s emotion regulation. This review also discusses implications for prevention and intervention work with fathers and children, as well as key methodological issues and future directions for research and policy.

One hundred and twenty five children (85 VPT and 40 full‐term) underwent neurodevelopmental evaluation at age 5‐years. Parents and teachers completed measures of internalizing, externalizing, attention‐deficit/hyperactivity (ADHD), and autism symptoms. Psychiatric and neurodevelopmental measures were analyzed using Latent Profile Analysis. Multinomial regression examined the extent that infant, sociodemographic, and family factors, collected prospectively from birth to follow‐up, independently differentiated resilient and impaired children. Four latent profiles were identified, including a Typically Developing Group which represented 27.1% of the VPT group and 65.0% of the full‐term group, an At‐Risk Group with mild psychiatric and neurodevelopmental problems (VPT 44.7%, full‐term 22.5%), a Psychiatric Group with moderate‐to‐severe psychiatric ratings (VPT 12.9%, full‐term 10.0%), and a school‐based Inattentive/Hyperactive Group (VPT 15.3%, full‐term 2.5%). Clinical diagnoses were highest among the Psychiatric Group (80%). Factors that differentiated resilient and impaired subgroups of VPT children included prolonged exposure to maternal psychosocial distress, current family dysfunction, and maternal ADHD symptoms, whereas social risk index scores differentiated resilient and impaired full‐term children. Maternal distress and family dysfunction are modifiable factors to be targeted as part of psychiatric interventions embedded in the long‐term care of VPT children.

Intrusive parenting is parenting which is overly directive and controlling of children’s play, and it has traditionally been considered a negative parenting style. However, current research aims to contextualize this parenting style. This study examined the relation between intrusive parenting and early childhood behavior problems or emotion regulation, as well as the moderating role of race/ethnicity and developmental level. Participants (n=511; 47.4% male) were part of a larger, longitudinal study on an Early Head Start sample. The sample was racially and ethnically diverse (40.1% White, 18.7% Black, and 41.2% Hispanic). Behavior problems and developmental level were assessed via parent report, while parental intrusiveness and emotion regulation were rated by observers. Higher use of intrusive parenting at age 2 predicted greater behavior problems and less emotion regulation at age 3. However, this relation was moderated by race/ethnicity and developmental level. Greater intrusiveness was related to increased behavior problems and poorer emotion regulation for White families; they were unrelated in Black families. Similarly, though intrusive parenting and behavior problems were related at each developmental level, the relation was strongest for children at average or above levels of development. Further, fewer maternal risk factors, being female, and being Hispanic/Latino were associated with higher emotion regulation, and fewer risk factors were associated with fewer behavior problems. These findings highlight the importance of considering how a child’s context and development interact with parenting style. Children may benefit from clinical assessment and intervention that considers this intersectionality.

Emily,Gerstein,"<p style=""font-size:12pt;""><span>Factors affecting caregiving competence in female family carers.</span></p>",International Journal of Care and Caring,,,,,,,Submitted,,,,,Spring,2023,"(38 pages) (Submitted 2/18/21) Objectives: Unpaid family caregivers commonly experience stress, anxiety, and depression, but there are also positive consequences of caregiving. The aim of this study is to determine correlates of self-perceived caregiving competence, a positive caregiving outcome, in family caregivers of physically and cognitively impaired older adults. Design: Measures were collected as part of a pre-intervention assessment for a larger intervention study of intergenerational caregivers. Heirarchical linear regression was used to determine the extent to which self-efficacy for controlling upsetting thoughts, caregiver prepardedness and self-reassurance were related to varying levels of self-perceived caregiving competence. Setting: Measures were completed online by the participants. Participants: Participants were 146 women in the United States who provided unpaid care to community-dwelling older adults. Measurements: The main outcome measure was self-perceived competence. Other measures included caregiver annual income and level of education, an analogue caregiver-report version of the Clinical Dementa Rating Scale, number of ADL/IADLs care recipients needed help with, the percentage of care provided by the caregiver, the length of time spent caregiving, Revised Scale for Caregiving Self-Efficacy, the Archbold Preparedness Scale, and the Self-Reassurance Scale. Results: Regression analyses identified self-efficacy for controlling upsetting throughts, caregiver prepardedness, and self-reassurance as significant correlates of self-perceived caregiving competence, when controlling for all other variables. Conclusions: These findings support Crellin et al.’s (2014) model depicting different trajectories for caregiving stressors. Specifically, caregivers can experience positive caring outcomes following a trajectory that includes appraisals and self-efficacy beliefs following challenging caregiving situations.",Kelly A Bergstrom*; Ann Steffen; Emily D Gerstein,,,,,,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,English,,Self-reported,
Emily,Gerstein,(R) Developmental delay and parenting: The role of behavior problems in toddlers,Infant and Child Development,,2020.0,29,e2199,,,Completed/Published,10.1002/icd.2199,,,,Fall,2020,"Developmental delays (DD) are missed early childhood developmental milestones in cognitive, motoric or linguistic domains. DD associated with behavior problems may compound to impact parenting. This study investigated whether DD would moderate the relation between behavior problems and parenting in families of toddlers. Data were drawn from an Early Head Start (n=564) sample. The Ages and Stages Questionnaire- 3rd edition measured developmental status at age 2 (typically developing, in a monitoring zone, or having a DD), behavior problems were assessed at age 2, and supportive and negative parenting at age 3. Developmental delay moderated the relationship between behavior problems and supportive parenting such that greater behavior problems was unrelated to parental supportiveness for children with DD, while greater behavior problems led to less parental supportiveness for typically developing children. These findings suggest distinct developmental processes, with parental supportiveness acting as potentially protective for children with DD. My role included conceptualization, manuscript preparation, and supervision.

This prospective longitudinal study addresses differences in whole family interactions in 194 families of young children with and without early-identified developmental risk associated with cognitive delay. The influence of family interactions on children’s later externalizing behaviors, internalizing behaviors, and social skills was examined, and developmental risk was tested as a potential moderator of these relations. Results indicated that the presence of cognitive developmental risk was linked to higher levels of family control than in families of typically developing children, but groups did not differ on dimensions of cohesion, warmth, organization, or conflict. Observed cohesion and organization were associated with better social skills for all children, regardless of risk status. Significant interactions emerged, indicating that higher levels of conflict and control were associated with higher levels of behavior problems, but only for families of typically developing children. These findings underscore the importance of family-level assessment in understanding the development of children’s behavior and suggest the need for deeper analysis of the nuances of family process over time. I was the primary author and my role included conceptualization, grant funding, data collection, data analysis, and the majority of the manuscript preparation.

We examined its effect on children’s empathy and self-regulation and explored how the curriculum might be the needs of children attending federally subsidized preschools. Children in five preschool classrooms were randomly assigned by classroom to either a 12-week mindfulness intervention or a treatment as usual (TAU) and assessed at three time points: pre-intervention (Time 1), immediately post-intervention (Time 2), and 3-month follow-up (Time 3). Children in the mindfulness intervention significantly increased their attentional focus from Time 1 to Time 2 compared to children in the TAU group. Similarly, compared to the TAU group, children in the mindfulness intervention significantly increased their self-regulation skills at Time 2, and these results were maintained at Time 3.  There were no changes in empathy or compassion in either the TAU or mindfulness intervention group.   Qualitative analysis of classroom observations and instructor interview data suggested that the intervention can be developmentally structure to meet the needs of economically disadvantaged children.

We report on a randomized controlled preliminary efficacy study. Certified teachers administered CBCT for 20 hours across 8 to 10 weeks in two cohorts of parents with infants and young children. The intervention group was compared to a waitlist control group. Thirty‐nine parents and their children, who ranged in age from 4 months to 5 years, were evaluated at pre‐ and post-intervention (n = 25 intervention, n = 14 waitlist control) on hair cortisol concentration. Parents also completed self‐administered questionnaires at both time points regarding demographics, physical symptoms of stress, parenting stress, self‐compassion, and mindfulness. Children of parents in the CBCT group experienced significant decreases in cortisol at the post-intervention assessment, as compared with the control group. However, parent cortisol and self‐report measures did not significantly change other than a small effect on clinical levels of parenting stress. CBCT may be a positive new way to intervene with parents to lower infants’ and young children's cumulative physiological stress.

However, individual variation and resilience are hallmarks of the preterm population. The present study examined pathways to resilience across multiple domains (e.g. social activities, peer relations, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptomatology, externalizing and internalizing behavior, and sleep quality) as children born preterm reached school age. The study also examined early child and family predictors of resilience. Using a prospective longitudinal design, 173 infants born preterm and without significant neurological complications were assessed at five time points: neonatal intensive care unit discharge, 9 months, 16 months, 24 months, and 6 years. Three pathways of adaptation emerged at 6 years: children who were resilient, those who remained at-risk, and children who exhibited significant difficulties. Resilient children were less likely to have experienced negative parenting at 9 and 16 months, more likely to delay gratification at 24 months, and more likely to experience neonatal health complications than nonresilient children. My role on this project involved conceptualization, formal data analysis, and manuscript preparation.

Background: Household chaos relates to children’s difficulty with self-regulation and behavior problems. Emotionally responsive parenting could protect against the detrimental effects of chaos for children. However, both the perception of chaos and impact of parenting behaviors on children’s behavior may vary with race, ethnicity, crowding in the home, and other contextual factors. Method: This study examined relations among chaos, observed emotional responsivity, and toddler’s subsequent behavior problems among EHS Family and Child Experiences Study participants. Results: Chaos was associated with more behavior problems, and three-way interaction findings indicated significant group differences by race/ethnicity in the relation between chaos and parenting on behavior problems. Behavior problems were also higher in lower socioeconomic contexts, and with child exposure to violence. Conclusion: Chaos and parenting both influence children’s early behavior problems, with distinct findings by race, ethnicity, socioeconomic and other contextual factors.Implications: These findings may reflect differing perceptions and effects of chaos and parenting, with important implications for research and prevention.",Emily D Gerstein; Kathryn E Cherry*,,,,,,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

At age 5-years, 154 children (VPT=88, FT=66) participated in a parent-child interaction (PCI) with their parent and completed EF tasks. Parenting sensitivity, intrusiveness, cognitive stimulation, and positive and negative regard for the child were coded with the Parent-Child Interaction Rating Scale. Socioeconomic adversity spanned measures of maternal socio-demographic risk, Income-to-Needs ratio, and Area Deprivation Index percentiles. Parents completed self-report measures of depression, anxiety, parenting stress, inattention/hyperactivity symptoms, and social-communication interaction (SCI) problems. Results showed that negative parenting behaviors, but not positive parenting behaviors, were more strongly related to EF in VPT and FT children. This association was subsequently explained by parental depression and socioeconomic adversity. Results persisted after adjustment for parent IQ and child IQ. Parental SCI problems were associated with parenting dysfunction in the VPT group, whereas socioeconomic adversity was significant in the FT group.

This study examines how maternal depressive symptoms and stress in the NICU are related to parenting behaviors at age 5 years, in mothers of children born very preterm (at ≤30 weeks’ gestation). This longitudinal study followed a diverse sample of 74 very preterm children and their mothers. Maternal depression and stress were assessed in the NICU. At age 5, mother−child dyads were observed and coded for maternal intrusiveness, negativity, sensitivity, and positivity. Other covariates, including maternal and child intelligence, maternal education, income-to-needs ratio, maternal depression at age 5 years, and child sex were included in multivariate analyses. The interaction between maternal NICU stress and NICU depression for intrusiveness and negativity indicates that greater NICU depression was associated with more intrusiveness under medium or high levels of NICU stress, and more negativity under high levels of NICU stress. Furthermore, greater NICU depression was associated with less sensitivity, over and above other covariates. Findings suggest that early maternal peripartum depression and stress in the NICU can have lasting impacts on multiple parenting behaviors, highlighting the need for screening and targeted interventions in the NICU. My role included conceptualization, data collection, data analysis, and manuscript preparation.

This longitudinal study followed 148 children and their mothers from neonatal intensive care unit discharge until 6 years of age. Gestational ages ranged from 23 to 36 weeks. Trajectories were identified with a semiparametric group-based analytic method, and multinomial logistic was used to identify significant risk factors. Three distinct trajectories for preterm children were found for both internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. For the 2 groups with greater behavior problems (groups 1 and 2), trajectories reached their peak between 24 and 36 months of age, then leveled off or decreased. Group 3 showed a stable low level of externalizing behaviors, and a low, but slightly increasing level of internalizing behaviors. Maternal depression, child dysregulation, gestational age, and socioeconomic challenges were identified as risk factors that predicted less optimal behavior problem trajectories. The most severe behavior problems started early in development and were associated with increased child dysregulation, maternal depression, and lower socioeconomic status. These findings have implications for screening and monitoring preterm children.

In this paper, it is empirically confirmed that association participation strengthens municipal managers’ predispositions toward engaging citizens. It is found that municipal managers that are active in generalist-oriented professional associations will be more likely to realize successful practices for citizen engagement in peer municipalities, which boosts their perceived sense of citizen contribution, and reduces their perceptions on the costliness of engaging citizens. These relationships are found to be mediated by municipal managers’ technocratic orientation and engagement self-efficacy.

To test the model, self-administered mail surveys were compiled from two American states—New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The findings address the role of individual intentionality. The municipal manager’s attitudinal willingness, his perceived ease or difficulty, the trust she receives from elected officials, and the capacity to coordinate effectively are significantly related to his consistent use of two-way engagement mechanisms. However, district representatives and pressures channeled through media scrutiny are not able to compel a municipal manager to routine use of such mechanisms.

This study proposes that nonprofits’ intentions to maintain collaborations with government are influenced by both instrumental and relational factors. Using a national sample of human service nonprofits, this study demonstrates that both nonprofits’ continuance commitment and affective commitment play a role in shaping their intentions to maintain collaborative relationships with government. Specifically, continuance commitment is driven by the presence of a formal agreement and the dependence on government funding, and affective commitment is shaped by distributive and procedural justice.

This study examines whether single-item attitude measures commonly used in research adequately capture adolescent attitudes towards specific delinquent behaviors. It also explores whether delinquent attitudes form a unidimensional or multidimensional construct. Finally, this study tests Ajzen and Fishbein’s principle of compatibility to determine if delinquent attitudes have a behavior-specific and a situation-specific effect on behavior.
Methods

Data from a sample of 223 high school students in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) and from the Gang Resistance Education and Training (GREAT) evaluation are used. The means and correlations between single-item global attitude items are compared to situation-specific measures. Exploratory factor analysis is conducted to examine dimensionality, and logit regressions are used to predict the willingness to offend in the PNW and self-reported offending in the GREAT.
Results

The findings indicate that: (1) global attitude measures underestimate the degree of approval of delinquency and are not strongly correlated with situation-specific attitudes; (2) delinquent attitudes form a multidimensional construct that coalesce around crime-types; (3) there is some evidence that attitudes towards specific crimes have crime-specific effects on behavior, and; (4) situation-specific attitudes predict the willingness to offend in a specific situation above and beyond one’s overall approval of that behavior.
Conclusions

Attitudes towards fighting and theft are too complex to be captured by single-item measures. The findings also support the principle of compatibility which suggests that attitudes may be well-suited to explain why individual engage in specific types of crimes in specific situations. Other implications and limitations are discussed.",Kyle J Thomas,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,,None,,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Lead / Corresponding author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Across two samples of university students (Ns = 396 and 263), the results revealed that as the size of the involved group increased, the anticipated experience of sanction risk and several informal social costs associated with engaging in the act decreased, and the anticipated experience of two rewards increased.

To consider, at a conceptual level, the factors that inform perceptions of peer deviance and subsequently, at an empirical level, the extent to which survey information from high school students confirms whether these elements shape perceptions of friends’ drinking. This study also offers an alternative way to document projection bias.
Methods:

249 public high school students completed a survey about what factors inform their perceptions of friends’ drinking behavior. Subjects also responded to several vignettes in order to assess their general tendency to engage in projection.
Results:

Subjects rely on both observed behavior and various forms of communication when forming perceptions of friends’ drinking, though there is notable variation across these elements. When using hypothetical vignettes, results suggest projection bias is significantly diminished as subjects are provided with more information about a hypothetical peer.
Conclusions:

Adolescents appear to rely on a wide range of information when forming perceptions about friends’ drinking behavior. Although we did document a tendency to engage in projection when subjects had minimal information about a peer, the fragility of this tendency questions whether perceptual measures are inherently contaminated.",Kyle J Thomas; Jean Marie McGloin,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,,None,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Co-author,,"Shared contribution in the theoretical development, primary data collector, shared contribution in the analyses",,,English,,Self-reported,

The recent debates over super-diversity or hyper-diversity in urban studies and geography correspond with the recognition in sociology and human development of a growing heterogeneity in the transition of young people to adulthood across western societies. While national systems of education, employment and welfare continue to stratify opportunities in particular ways, they also shape the relative importance of local contexts such as neighborhoods for providing access to important resources and supports. Greater diversity on the neighborhood level could potentially benefit disadvantaged and minority youth by providing access to more diverse social networks and relationships. The importance of these questions is amplified by persisting patterns of inequality and exclusion, despite the diversification in the fabric of cities and neighborhoods and the greater variability in life course trajectories. Drawing on a study of disadvantaged immigrant young men in Dortmund/Germany and Chicago/USA, who grew up in diverse neighborhoods, this paper explores the mechanisms through which they formed relationships that critically shaped their transitional experience.",Florian Sichling (Role:Author),,,Blind Peer Reviewed,International,Research Board,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Lead / Corresponding author,Fahs-Beck Fund for Research and Experimentation,,,,English,,Self-reported,4.0

Drawing on administrative data and qualitative interviews with administrators, front-line workers and refugee youth in Nuremberg, the article provides a contextualized account of how the crisis led to the collapse of established bureaucratic procedures, new forms of interagency collaboration and a flexible distribution of responsibilities and tasks. Combining a street-level bureaucracy (SLB) perspective with insights from the literature on crisis and policy change, the analysis shows how the responses of front-line workers effectively altered the content of services, introduced new actors and expanded the professional capacity of the local child welfare system. On a broader level, the findings indicate that front-line practice is not merely guided by policy mandates, but also responds to situational and institutional circumstances. For the child welfare system in Nuremberg, the findings raise important questions about the extent to which aspects of the crisis response will remain a part of the service delivery process moving forward, and whether the recent experience will better prepare them for future crises.

As a result, traditional notions of success may limit our understanding of the mechanisms that lead to differential transitional and adaptation pathways among today’s children of immigrants. This study explores the definitions of success among a sample of Bosnian-origin youth in St. Louis. 
Method: The analysis is based on the first wave of in-depth qualitative interviews with 58 Bosnian second-generation youth (age 13-23) in St. Louis. Interviews lasted 45-90 minutes, were conducted in English, transcribed and coded following an inductive analytic logic. 
Results: Overall the respondents complemented traditional notions of success, such as material stability and family formation with more subjective indicators such as self-fulfillment and happiness. 
Conclusions: The findings highlight the importance for future waves of data collection to trace how definitions of success evolve and how they shape particular trajectories of the youth in our study. On a more general level, these findings urge researchers to incorporate definitions of success that are not primarily based on social and economic status mobility in an effort to generate a more nuanced understanding of the adaptations and transitions to adulthood of today’s children of immigrants.

Overly narrow conceptualizations of the EBP model deepened the gap between practice knowledge and formal research evidence in the profession. While much has been written about the dissemination and adaptation of research findings to practice, much less is known about the actual sources of knowledge social workers draw on in their practice. This paper reports findings from an exploratory survey about the sources and content of knowledge that changed professional practice among social work field instructors (n=250) in St. Louis. The qualitative analysis of open-ended questions reveals that co-workers and continuing education programs are the most important sources for knowledge and information that influences practice. While academic journals are perceived to be relatively unimportant sources for such knowledge, research findings on the background and effectiveness of interventions, however, make up the primary content that appears to affect social work practice. The findings suggest that formal research knowledge is important but that it is primarily accessed through professional networks and training programs instead of peer-reviewed journals. Social media platforms seemed to be insignificant sources for professional knowledge. These insights raise important questions about how social workers use social media and the role of occupational networks and associations for the dissemination of research findings. Finally, our findings suggest that agencies and researchers think more purposefully about the infusion of knowledge into practice through opportunities for professional socialization, the use of research briefs and open-access, peer-reviewed journals.

For immigrant youth, these perceptions also influence their developing sense of self and how they navigate different social contexts. Considering the growing diversity of immigrants and their places of settlement in the U.S., however, the empirical focus on native Whites’ perceptions of immigrant newcomers does not adequately reflect the range of potential in-group/out-group configurations. We know very little, for instance, about native minorities’ perceptions of White newcomers in different receiving contexts. The experience of Bosnian youth in St. Louis provides a unique case for examining perceptions of White newcomers in a nontraditional immigrant 
gateway, characterized by a sharp racial binary in its native population. Data for the present study includes i) qualitative interviews with 62 second-generation Bosnian youth and ii) a quantitative survey of non-Bosnian adult residents in St. Louis. Results show that overall, St. Louisians have positive 
views of Bosnians. This finding is complicated, however, by somewhat less favorable perceptions among Blacks than among Whites and the fact that most respondents indicated limited contact with Bosnians. In their interviews, Bosnian youth revealed that they use subtle cues such as mannerisms and shared cultural knowledge that are largely invisible to natives, to differentiate 
between groups. While our findings indicate that Bosnian youth may simply pass as Whites in their daily interactions with non-Bosnians, the results raise important questions about the extent to which these perceptions influence actual social networks and socialization patterns.

We conducted in-depth interviews and mental mapping exercises with young people aged 14–19 in both sites. We found that neighbourhoods matter because they expose young people to certain kinds of risks, but also that their responses were shaped by their perceptions and interpretations of these risks. Moreover, we illustrate the dynamic and interactive nature of these processes of risk perception and management by discussing the ways in which different groups occupy and use, or travel through, public space at different times of the day.

They provide resources and opportunities for positive interactions with peers and non-family adults. But neighbourhoods differ systemically in their demographic composition and the type and quality of resources they offer young people. In the US, there is an implicit assumption equating suburban neighbourhoods with better schools, more jobs and higher quality housing compared to urban neighbourhoods. There is however, little explicit empirical evidence of how such differences may shape the experience of immigrant youth. This gap is concerning in light of recent trends of immigrants to move directly to the suburbs. The first part of the paper reviews the literatures on immigrant adaptation and neighbourhood effects.

The analysis reveals however, that the respondents experienced these rather traditional father roles in different ways, ranging from extreme violence and neglect to dedication and sacrifice, which in turn, led to rejection, modification or emulation in their own conceptions of fatherhood.

Shorter FBL also corresponds to poorer performance on cognitive measures sensitive to advanced age. However, it is unclear if individual factors such as cognitive reserve (CR) effectively moderate the relationship between FBL and cognitive performance. This study examined CR as a potential moderator of cognitive performance and brain integrity as defined by FBL. Sixty-three healthy adults underwent neuropsychological evaluation and 3T brain magnetic resonance imaging. Cognitive performance was measured using the Repeatable Battery of Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). FBL was quantified from tractography tracings of white matter fiber bundles, derived from the diffusion tensor imaging. CR was determined by estimated premorbid IQ. Analyses revealed that lower scores on the RBANS were associated with shorter whole brain FBL (p = 0.04) and lower CR (p = 0.01) CR moderated the relationship between whole brain FBL and RBANS score (p < 0.01). Tract-specific analyses revealed that CR also moderated the association between FBL in the hippocampal segment of the cingulum and RBANS performance (p = 0.03). These results demonstrate that lower cognitive performance on the RBANS is more common with low CR and short FBL. On the contrary, when individuals have high CR, the relationship between FBL and cognitive performance is attenuated. Overall, CR protects older adults against lower cognitive performance despite age-associated reductions in FBL.",Matthew R Brier; Robert H Paul; Amanda R McMichael; Elizabeth M Lane; Lauren E Salminen; Jacob Bolzenius; Jodi M Heaps-Woodruff; David F Tate; Stephen Correia; Thomas E Conturo; Erbil Akbudak; Ryan Cabeen; David H Laidlaw; Laurie M Baker,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Further, the impact of the threonine variant on cognitive function remains unknown. The present study utilized multiple indices of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neuropsychological assessment to examine the integrity of specific white matter tracts and cognition between individuals with homozygous genotypes of M268T (MetMet n=27, ThrThr n=27). Differences in subcortical hyperintensity (SH) volume were also examined between groups. Results indicated that the threonine variant was associated with significantly reduced integrity in the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) and the cingulate gyrus segment of the cingulum bundle (cingulum CG) compared to those with the methionine variant, and poorer cognitive performance on tests of attention/processing speed and language. Despite these associations, integrity of these tracts did not significantly mediate relationships between cognition and genetic status, and SH did not differ significantly between groups.

The majority who sustain mTBI recover, although ~20 % continue to experience symptoms that can interfere with quality of life. Accordingly, there is a critical need to improve diagnosis, prognostic accuracy, and monitoring (recovery trajectory over time) of mTBI. Volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been successfully utilized to examine TBI. One promising improvement over standard volumetric approaches is to analyze high-dimensional shape characteristics of brain structures. In this study, subcortical shape and volume in 76 Service Members with mTBI was compared to 59 Service Members with orthopedic injury (OI) and 17 with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) only. FreeSurfer was used to quantify structures from T1-weighted 3 T MRI data. Radial distance (RD) and Jacobian determinant (JD) were defined vertex-wise on parametric mesh-representations of subcortical structures. Linear regression was used to model associations between morphometry (volume and shape), TBI status, and time since injury (TSI) correcting for age, sex, intracranial volume, and level of education. Volumetric data was not significantly different between the groups. JD was significantly increased in the accumbens and caudate and significantly reduced in the thalamus of mTBI participants. Additional significant associations were noted between RD of the amygdala and TSI. Positive trend-level associations between TSI and the amygdala and accumbens were observed, while a negative association was observed for third ventricle.

The objective of this study was to identify subgroups of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans (IAVs) with distinct compositions of symptoms associated with TBI, PTSD, and depression. Our cross-sectional, observational study included 303,716 IAVs who received care in the Veterans Health Administration in 2010-2011. Symptoms and conditions were defined using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes and symptom-clusters were identified using latent class analysis. We identified seven classes with distinct symptom compositions. One class had low probability of any condition and low health care utilization (HCU) (48 %). Other classes were characterized by high probabilities of mental health comorbidities (14 %); chronic pain and sleep disturbance (20 %); headaches and memory problems (6 %); and auditory problems (2.5 %). Another class had mental health comorbidities and chronic pain (7 %), and the last had high probabilities of most symptoms examined (3 %). These last two classes had the highest likelihood of TBI, PTSD, and depression and were identified as high healthcare utilizers. There are subgroups of IAVs with distinct clusters of symptom that are meaningfully associated with TBI, PTSD, depression, and HCU.

We argue in this paper for an explanation of the datum that appeals to common resources in metaphysics and the philosophy of language.

William,Dunaway,Expressivism and Normative Metaphysics (R),Oxford Studies in Metaethics,,2016.0,11,241-264,,,Completed/Published,,,,,Spring,2016,"Expressivists about ethics hold that the primary function of ethical language is to express plans or attitudes, rather than to state facts about the world. But recent expressivists show that their proposal for the semantics of ethical terms makes many of the realist-sounding claims about ethical language come out true. I argue that, even if we grant this, there is a significant difference between expressivism and realism: the expressivist’s theory entails that ethical properties are not metaphysically elite; whereas the realist’s explanation requires this.

We do know about another causal influence on our ethical beliefs: natural selection as described by evolutionary theory. Some (“debunkers”) have argued that this shows that our ethical beliefs, even if true, cannot be knowledge, because they do not track the facts they are about in the right way. I argue that this conclusion depends heavily on the details of the evolutionary explanation of our ethical beliefs, and so evolutionary debunkers have not made a compelling case.

Curricular, conversational, and collaborative inquiry deepened awareness and activated activism toward issues of racial justice. The use of high-impact practices (Kuh, 2008) allowed the cohort and faculty mentors to delve further into heritage leadership themes, including: confronting difficult emotions, recognizing sanctified space, facilitating group bonding and trust building, identifying models for activism, and moving forward in activism. We argue that the emergence of these themes demonstrates the value of immersing students and faculty in a shared, high-impact experience that focused on awareness, remembering, and wondering—the process of imagining the not yet (Keenan-Lechel et al., 2019)—as a means to “activate activism” in a cohort-based Ed.D. program.",Lisa Marie Overholser (Role:Author); William W.

A tenet of the Multi-Tier System of Supports (MTSS) is that evidence-based interventions will not be effective with all children.  We examined the range in children’s response to an evidence-based, supplemental literacy intervention (Story Friends) in two preschool classrooms (A and B) using single case design.  Based on universal screening, the children with weak vocabulary skills were identified and received the Story Friends intervention.  The children’s response to Story Friends ranged from highly effective (responsive children) to very ineffective (unresponsive children) in both classrooms.  In classroom (B), three children not responsive to Story Friends were targeted to receive additional complementary intervention components in an effort to achieve a better response.  Given additional components, two children acquired new vocabulary words at rates comparable to peers in both classroom, who were highly responsive to the supplemental Story Friends intervention only, and much greater than peers not making progress and not receiving additional support.  We had to drop the third child from the study due to refusal to attend sessions.  Control word probes demonstrated that children’s progress was a function of the interventions and not simply listening to the words read in the stories. Implications are discussed.

Background
Many individuals comprise a nursing mother’s social support network. Grandmothers within African American families, historically, have played a vital role in the transmission of culture. Understanding intergenerational perspectives within African American families related to infant feeding and scholarship about breastfeeding is critical, given the breastfeeding patterns among African American women.

Research aim
To describe intergenerational perspectives within African American families, where the mother has successfully breastfed.

Methods
A prospective, cross-sectional, qualitative design using semi-structured interviews was used. African American nursing mothers and maternal grandmothers (N = 14) residing in the Metro–St. Louis area, who reflected economic and educational diversity, were recruited. Inductive and iterative data analysis, framed by Black Feminist Theory allowed for emerging patterns reflecting the participants’ voices.

Results
Three of the six (50%) grandmother participants had breastfed. The majority of the mother participants were married (n = 5; 62.5%) and had a college degree (n = 4; 50.0%) or a high school diploma (n = 1; 12.5%); and four (50.0%) had received the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). Three patterns emerged: (a) intergenerational connections; (b) changes in breastfeeding experiences over time; and (c) going with the flow (referring to the choice to work within the constraints of one’s circumstances). Grandmothers supported mothers’ breastfeeding decisions; grandmothers who had breastfed benefited from the updated information the mothers provided; and grandmothers who did not breastfeed acquired new breastfeeding knowledge, which informed the ways they supported the mothers.

Conclusion
The intergenerational perspectives surrounding breastfeeding within African American families participating in this study offer future research directions.",Mary M Muse (Role:Author); Jerome E Morris (Role:Author); Joan E Dodgson (Role:Author),,,Blind Peer Reviewed,International,External,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,English,,Self-reported,2.0

Jerome,Morris,Researching the Neighborhood and Schooling Experiences of Black Male High-School “Students-Who-Play-Sports” in Atlanta and Chicago,Teachers College Record,,2020.0,122,52,8,,Completed/Published,,,,,Fall,2020,"Background/Context: The corpus of scholarship on Black male students who play sports focuses on students at the collegiate level, thus ignoring the regional, neighborhood, and K–12 educational backgrounds and experiences of these young people before some matriculate into a college or university. This omission suggests the need for more robust investigations that (a) focus on Black males during K–12 schooling, (b) place Black male students’ experiences within the larger geographic (e.g., regions, neighborhoods and schools) and social and historical contexts in which they live and go to school, and thereby, (c) seek to understand how these contexts shape students’ experiences and beliefs about race and the role of academics and athletics in their lives and future.
Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: We investigated two research questions: (1) For Black male students who play high school sports, how do the social contexts shape their experiences and their beliefs about race and the role of academics and athletics in their lives and future? (2) And, what are the consequences of Black male students’ experiences and beliefs for their academic and athletic outcomes? This investigation across geographically and economically contrasting cities, neighborhoods, and schools in the U.S. South (metro Atlanta, Georgia) and Midwest (Chicago, Illinois) offers empirical, theoretical, and practice-related evidence about young Black males’ experiences and beliefs about race, academics, and athletics, while providing a window into the complex social and cultural worlds in which they live, go to school, and play sports.
Research Design: This article emanates from research studies that employed ethnographic research methods such as interviews and observations, while embedding the researchers within the communities where Black people resided. The research design used a cross-case analysis to investigate participants’ experiences and beliefs. The constant comparative method allowed
for the synthesizing of data collected from two different research sites.",Jerome E Morris (Role:Author); Adeoye O Adeyemo (Role:Author),,,Blind Peer Reviewed,International,Research Board,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,Spencer Foundation,,,,English,,Self-reported,

The under-emphasis of the U.S. South in contemporary school closings research and policy debates disconnects this reform from a much longer, vile, and racist history of school closings that have had devastating consequences for Black students, educators, families and communities. By shifting this discussion to the U.S. South where the majority of Black people have historically and continue to reside--and linking it with the region’s history--we highlight the connection between previous waves of Black school closings and contemporary case studies of closings in three urban southern spaces. This paper informs research and policy on the need for regional analyses, and the vital role of Black educational institutions across history, within Black communities, and for African-American culture and achievement.

(R) Machine learning and classification algorithms provide means for using data to create predictions for enhanced decision making, but these methods do not account for the preferences of the decision maker. This research develops analytic results supporting the selection of cutoff thresholds for classification algorithms that account for a decision maker’s risk attitude. This work bridges theory and practice for both the literature on decision analysis and the literature for machine learning.

The research includes a problem formulation that enables the development of theorems with full proofs, illustrative examples, sensitivity analysis, and discussion of the implications of the findings for industry.

(R) Multicriteria methods are often used to support decision making. This paper describes a property of scale dependence in the measurement of attributes within these methods in which a rank-preserving transformation of the scale can change the ranking of the overall preferred alternative. This property has not previously been identified in the literature. Analytic results show the conditions under which preferences are robust to scale modifications and conditions when preferences are especially sensitive to them. These results highlight the importance of sensitivity analysis when applying multicriteria methods in practice.

Recent neuroimaging research suggests that altered variability in the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal may disrupt normal network integration and be an important novel predictor of psychopathology. However, no studies have yet determined the relationship between resting-state BOLD signal variability and depressive disorders nor applied BOLD signal variability features to the classification of depression history using machine learning (ML). We collected resting-state fMRI data for 79 women with different depression histories: no history, past history, and current depressive disorder. We tested voxelwise differences in BOLD signal variability related to depression group and severity. We also investigated whether BOLD signal variability of DMN, FPN, and SN regions could predict depression history group using a supervised random forest ML model. Results indicated that individuals with any history of depression had significantly decreased BOLD signal variability in the left and right cerebellum and right parietal cortex (pFWE <0.05). Furthermore, greater depression severity was also associated with reduced BOLD signal variability in the cerebellum. A random forest model classified participant depression history with 74% accuracy, with the ventral anterior cingulate cortex of the DMN as the most important variable in the model.

Maladaptive and adaptive subtypes of rumination contribute to distinct outcomes, with brooding worsening negative mood and reflection related to fewer depression symptoms in healthy populations. Neuroimaging studies have implicated several cortical midline and lateral prefrontal brain regions in rumination. Recent research indicates that blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal variability may be a novel predictor of cognitive flexibility. However, no prior studies have investigated whether brooding and reflection are associated with distinct patterns of BOLD signal variability in depression. We collected resting-state fMRI data for 79 women with different depression histories: no history, past history, and current depression. We examined differences in BOLD signal variability (BOLD<sub>SD</sub>) related to rumination subtypes for the following regions of interest previously implicated in rumination: amygdala, medial prefrontal, anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (dlPFC). Rumination subtype was associated with BOLD<sub>SD</sub> in the dlPFC, with greater levels of brooding associated with lower BOLD<sub>SD</sub> in the dlPFC, even after controlling for depression severity. Depression history was related to BOLD<sub>SD</sub> in the dlPFC, with reduced BOLD<sub>SD</sub> in those with current depression versus no history of depression.

Carissa,Philippi,(R) Subclinical depression severity is associated with distinct patterns of functional connectivity for subregions of anterior cingulate cortex,Journal of Psychiatric Research,12/1/2015,2015.0,71,103-111,Supplement C,,Completed/Published,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2015.10.005,26468907,PMC4630072,0022-3956,Fall,2015,"Depression is a prevalent psychiatric condition characterized by sad mood and anhedonia. Neuroscientific research has consistently identified abnormalities in a network of brain regions in major depression, including subregions of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). However, few studies have investigated whether the same neural correlates of depression symptom severity are apparent in subclinical or healthy subjects. In the current study, we used resting-state fMRI to examine functional connectivity for subregions of the ACC in N = 28 participants with subclinical levels of depression. In regression analyses, we examined relationships between depression severity and functional connectivity for pregenual ACC (pgACC), anterior subgenual ACC (sgACC), and posterior sgACC seed regions. Additionally, we examined relationships between ACC subregion connectivity and trait levels of positive and negative affect. We found distinct associations between depression severity and functional connectivity of ACC subregions. Higher depression severity was associated with reduced pgACC-striatum connectivity and reduced anterior sgACC-anterior insula connectivity. Consistent with resting-state findings in major depression, higher depression severity was also related to greater anterior sgACC-posterior cingulate connectivity and greater posterior sgACC-dorsolateral prefrontal connectivity. Lastly, there were distinct correlations between connectivity for anterior versus posterior ACC subregions and positive and negative affective traits. These findings provide novel support linking subclinical depression to the same neural substrates associated with major depression. More broadly, these results contribute to an emerging literature on dimensional approaches to psychiatric illness.

Human neuroimaging studies have demonstrated coincident activation and functional connectivity between these brain regions, and animal studies have demonstrated that the vmPFC modulates ventral striatum activity. However, there have been no comparable data in humans to address whether the vmPFC may be critical for the reward-related response properties of the ventral striatum. In this study, we used fMRI in five neurosurgical patients with focal vmPFC lesions to test the hypothesis that the vmPFC is necessary for enhancing ventral striatum responses to the anticipation of reward. In support of this hypothesis, we found that, compared with age- and gender-matched neurologically healthy subjects, the vmPFC-lesioned patients had reduced ventral striatal activity during the anticipation of reward. Furthermore, we observed that the vmPFC-lesioned patients had decreased volumes of the accumbens subregion of the ventral striatum. Together, these functional and structural neuroimaging data provide novel evidence for a critical role for the vmPFC in contributing to reward-related activity of the ventral striatum. These results offer new insight into the functional and structural interactions between key components of the brain circuitry underlying human affective function and decision-making.

Targeted lesion research has documented impairments in mind-wandering after damage to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampal regions associated with the DMN. However, no lesion studies to date have applied lesion network mapping to identify common networks associated with deficits in mind-wandering. In lesion network mapping, resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) data from healthy participants are used to infer which brain regions are functionally connected to each lesion location from a sample with brain injury. In the current study, we conducted a lesion network mapping analysis to test the hypothesis that lesions affecting the DMN and FPN would be associated with diminished mind-wandering. We assessed mind-wandering frequency on the Imaginal Processes Inventory in participants with brain injury (n = 29) and healthy comparison participants without brain injury (n = 19). Lesion network mapping analyses showed the strongest association of reduced mind-wandering with the left IPL within the DMN. In addition, traditional lesion symptom mapping results revealed that reduced mind-wandering was associated with lesions of the dorsal, ventral, and anterior sectors of mPFC, inferior parietal lobule (IPL), and inferior frontal gyrus in the DMN (p < .05 uncorrected). These findings provide novel lesion support for the role of the DMN in mind-wandering and contribute to a burgeoning literature on the neural correlates of spontaneous cognition.

Studies of brain structure and function in psychopathy have frequently identified abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex. However, findings have not yet converged to yield a clear relationship between specific subregions of prefrontal cortex and particular psychopathic traits. We performed a multimodal neuroimaging study of prefrontal cortex volume and functional connectivity in psychopathy, using a sample of adult male prison inmates (N=124). We conducted volumetric analyses in prefrontal subregions, and subsequently assessed resting-state functional connectivity in areas where volume was related to psychopathy severity. We found that overall psychopathy severity and Factor 2 scores (which index the impulsive/antisocial traits of psychopathy) were associated with larger prefrontal subregion volumes, particularly in the medial orbitofrontal cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, Factor 2 scores were also positively correlated with functional connectivity between several areas of the prefrontal cortex. The results were not attributable to age, race, IQ, substance use history, or brain volume. Collectively, these findings provide evidence for co-localized increases in prefrontal cortex volume and intra-prefrontal RSFC in relation to impulsive/antisocial psychopathic traits.

Neuroimaging research has implicated cortical midline brain structures, including the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and isthmus cingulate (IsthCing), in rumination in healthy and depressed populations. While past research has revealed dysfunction in cortical midline regions in PTSD, no studies have yet investigated the structural and functional neural mechanisms underlying rumination in women with PTSD. In the current study, we used structural MRI and resting-state fMRI to examine relationships between rumination and brain volume, as well as resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of cortical midline structures in women with PTSD due to interpersonal trauma (N = 71). We performed multiple linear regression analyses to relate brain volume in rACC, PCC, and IsthCing regions to self-reported rumination, after controlling for age and total intracranial volume. We also conducted standard seed-based voxelwise rsFC analyses for significant regions identified in the structural analysis. We found a significant relationship between greater rumination and volume in the left IsthCing (p = .025). Results from the rsFC analyses revealed a significant relationship between greater rumination and diminished rsFC between the left IsthCing and left precuneus (pFWE < .05). These findings provide novel support for alterations in the neural substrates of ruminative thought in women with PTSD. More broadly, we discuss clinical implications for targeted interventions to reduce rumination through psychotherapy or non-invasive brain stimulation.

One potential psychological mechanism underlying these traits is the relative consideration of “self” versus “others”. Here we used task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify neural responses during personality trait judgments about oneself and a familiar other in a sample of adult male incarcerated offenders (n = 57). Neural activity was regressed on two clusters of psychopathic traits: Factor 1 (e.g., egocentricity and lack of empathy) and Factor 2 (e.g., impulsivity and irresponsibility). Contrary to our hypotheses, Factor 1 scores were not significantly related to neural activity during self- or other-judgments. However, Factor 2 traits were associated with diminished activation to self-judgments, in relation to other-judgments, in bilateral posterior cingulate cortex and right temporoparietal junction. These findings highlight cortical regions associated with a dimension of social-affective cognition that may underlie psychopathic individuals' impulsive traits.

Carissa,Philippi,"(R) Relationships between self-leadership, psychological symptoms, and self-related thought in an undergraduate sample",Psi Chi Journal of Psychological Research,6/2/2020,2020.0,25,142-150,2,,Completed/Published,https://doi.org/10.24839/2325-7342.JN25.2.142,,,,Summer,2020,"The concept of self-leadership was developed in the 1980s as an integral component of Internal Family Systems therapy (IFS). According to IFS, a self-led person can more effectively manage stress and difficult life events. These enhanced coping abilities associated with self-leadership are thought to reduce symptoms of psychiatric disorders. Several studies have investigated self-leadership in connection with workplace behavior, psychological health, and physical health. Few studies have examined the relationship between self-leadership and psychological symptoms in a community sample. Another important question is whether self-leadership is related to other established measures of self-related thought. In the current study, adult undergraduate participants (n = 166) completed self-report measures assessing psychological symptoms and self-related thought. We predicted that there would be a relationship between (H1) self-leadership and fewer psychological symptoms and (H2) self-leadership and lower levels of negative self-reference, but higher positive self-regard. Our findings revealed significant negative relationships between self-leadership and symptoms of depression (p < .001, f2 = .55), posttraumatic stress disorder (p < .05, f2 = .03), and social anxiety (p < .001, f2 = .21). Enhanced self-leadership was also associated with distinct correlations with measures of negative versus positive aspects of self-related cognition. Specifically, self-leadership was associated with lower levels of self-rumination (p = .005, f2 = .05) and negative self-related responses (p = .002, f2 = .06), but greater levels of self-reflection (p < .001, f2 = .12) and positive self-related responses (p = .021, f2 = .03). These findings provide novel empirical support for a relationship between self-leadership, symptoms of psychological conditions, and measures of self-related thought.

Carissa,Philippi,(R) Structural and functional brain imaging in acute HIV,Neuroimage-Clinical,7/27/2018,2018.0,20,327-335,,,Completed/Published,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2018.07.024,30101063,PMC6082997,,Summer,2018,"Background: HIV RNA is identified in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within eight days of estimated viral exposure. Neurological findings and impaired neuropsychological testing performance are documented in a subset of individuals with acute HIV infection (AHI). The purpose of this study was to determine whether microstructural white matter and resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) are disrupted in AHI.

Methods: We examined 49 AHI (100% male; mean age = 30 ± SD 9.9) and 23 HIV-uninfected Thai participants (78% male; age = 30 ± 5.5) with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and rsFC acquired at 3 Tesla, and four neuropsychological tests (summarized as NPZ-4). MRI for the AHI group was performed prior to combination antiretroviral treatment (ART) in 26 participants and on average two days (range:1–5) after ART in 23 participants. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean (MD), axial (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were quantified for DTI. Seed-based voxelwise rsFC analyses were completed for the default mode (DMN), fronto-parietal, and salience and 6 subcortical networks. rsFC and DTI analyses were corrected for family-wise error, with voxelwise comparisons completed using t-tests. Group-specific voxelwise regressions were conducted to examine relationships between imaging indices, HIV disease variables, and treatment status.

Results: The AHI group had a mean (SD) CD4 count of 421(234) cells/mm3 plasma HIV RNA of 6.07(1.1) log10 copies/mL and estimated duration of infection of 20(5.5) days. Differences between AHI and CO groups did not meet statistical significance for DTI metrics. Within the AHI group, voxelwise analyses revealed associations between brief exposure to ART and higher FA and lower RD and MD bilaterally in the corpus callosum, corona radiata, and superior longitudinal fasciculus (p < 0.05). Diffusion indices were unrelated to clinical variables or NPZ-4. The AHI group had reduced rsFC between left parahippocampal cortex (PHC) of the DMN and left middle frontal gyrus compared to CO (p < 0.002). Within AHI, ART status was unrelated to rsFC. However, higher CD4 cell count associated with increased rsFC for the right lateral parietal and PHC seeds in the DMN. Direct associations were noted between NPZ-4 correspond to higher rsFC of the bilateral caudate seed (p < 0.002).

Conclusions: Study findings reveal minimal disruption to structural and functional brain integrity in the earliest stages of HIV. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine if treatment with ART initiated in AHI is sufficient to prevent the evolution of brain dysfunction identified in chronically infected individuals.

Yet to our knowledge, few studies have examined self-referential cognition by analyzing survivors’ written impact statements in individuals whose PTSD is due to interpersonal trauma. In the current study, we performed a linguistic analysis of impact statements (i.e., descriptions of how the trauma has affected the survivors’ views of themselves, others, and the world) collected at the beginning of therapy from women with PTSD that was due to interpersonal trauma, with the goal of determining whether PTSD symptom clusters were associated with altered self-referential thought. We found that a higher level of PTSD-related hyperarousal symptoms were significantly associated with diminished self-related word use after controlling for depression severity, f2 = .31. Similarly, diminished negative self-related word use was also associated with a higher level of hyperarousal symptoms, f2 = .47. Our findings align with previous research that has provided evidence for a diminished sense of self in PTSD. These results may help inform targeted interventions aimed at improving social-affective functions in PTSD and other psychiatric conditions.

Neuroscientific research has identified abnormalities in a network of brain regions in MDD, including brain areas associated with SFT such as medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). To our knowledge no studies have investigated the behavioral and neural correlates of negative‐SFT using a sentence completion task in a sample of individuals with varying depression histories and severities. We test the following hypotheses: (1) negative‐SFT will be associated with depression; and (2) depression and negative‐SFT will be related to resting‐state functional connectivity (rsFC) for brain regions implicated in SFT. Seventy‐nine women with varying depression histories and severities completed a sentence completion task and underwent resting‐state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs‐fMRI). Standard seed‐based voxelwise rsFC was conducted for self‐network regions of interest: dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC) and pregenual ACC (pgACC). We performed linear regression analyses to examine the relationships among depression, negative‐SFT, and rsFC for the dmPFC and pgACC. Greater negative‐SFT was associated with depression history and severity. Greater negative‐SFT predicted increased rsFC between dmPFC and pgACC seeds and dorsolateral prefrontal (dlPFC) and parietal regions; depression group was also associated with increased pgACC‐dlPFC connectivity. These findings are consistent with previous literature reporting elevated negative‐SFT thought in MDD. Our rs‐fMRI results provide novel support linking negative‐SFT with increased rsFC between self‐network and frontoparietal network regions across different levels of depression. Broadly, these findings highlight a dimension of social‐affective functioning that may underlie MDD and other psychiatric conditions.

Carissa,Philippi,(R) Impulsive-antisocial dimension of psychopathy linked to enlargement and abnormal functional connectivity of the striatum,Biological Psychiatry : Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging,3/1/2017,2017.0,2,149-157,2,,Completed/Published,10.1016/j.bpsc.2016.07.004,28367514,PMC5373097,,Spring,2017,"Background: Psychopathy is a mental health disorder characterized by callous and impulsive antisocial behavior, and it is associated with a high incidence of violent crime, substance abuse, and recidivism. Recent studies suggest that the striatum may be a key component of the neurobiological basis for the disorder, although structural findings have been mixed, and functional connectivity of the striatum in psychopathy has yet to be fully examined.

Methods: We performed a multimodal neuroimaging study of striatum volume and functional connectivity in psychopathy using a large sample of adult male prison inmates (N = 124). We conducted volumetric analyses in striatal subnuclei and subsequently assessed resting-state functional connectivity in areas where volume was related to psychopathy severity.

Results: Total Psychopathy Checklist–Revised and factor 2 scores (which index the impulsive-antisocial traits of psychopathy) were associated with larger striatal subnuclei volumes and increased volume in focal areas throughout the striatum, particularly in the nucleus accumbens and putamen bilaterally. Furthermore, at many of the striatal areas where volume was positively associated with factor 2 scores, psychopathy severity was also associated with abnormal functional connectivity with other brain regions, including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, ventral midbrain, and other areas of the striatum. The results were not attributable to age, race, IQ, substance use history, or intracranial volume.

Conclusions: These findings associate the impulsive-antisocial dimension of psychopathy with enlarged striatal subnuclei and aberrant functional connectivity between the striatum and other brain regions. Furthermore, the colocalization of volumetric and functional connectivity findings suggests that these neural abnormalities may be pathophysiologically linked.

This trend is evident in and applicable to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) treatment research given the high nonresponse rate of individuals with PTSD who undergo cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Functional connectivity analyses investigating disrupted brain networks across mental disorders have been employed to understand both mental disorder symptoms and therapeutic mechanisms. However, few studies have examined pre-post CBT brain changes in PTSD using functional connectivity analyses. The current study investigated a) whether brain networks commonly implicated in psychopathology (e.g., default mode network [DMN], central executive network [CEN], and salience network [SN]) changed following Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) for PTSD and b) whether change in these networks was associated with PTSD and/or transdiagnostic symptom change. Independent components analysis was implemented to investigate resting-state functional connectivity in DMN, CEN, and SN in 42 women with PTSD and 18 trauma-exposed controls (TEC). Results indicated weaker CEN-cerebellum connectivity in PTSD participants versus TEC prior to CPT and weaker DMN connectivity in PTSD participants after CPT. Additionally, DMN and SN connectivity was related to change in PTSD symptoms, positive affectivity, negative affectivity, and rumination. These findings provide evidence for normalization of CEN with treatment and implicate the DMN and SN in clinical symptom change following CPT.

Carissa,Philippi,(R) Posttraumatic stress disorder symptom clusters are differentially related to functional connectivity in affective and default mode networks,Brain and Behavior ,,2019.0,,"(31 pages, typed double-spaced)",,,Submitted,,,,,Spring,2019,"Background: Numerous studies report altered functional connectivity in various brain networks in subjects with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) compared to controls. Moreover, connectivity in the affective network (AN) and default mode network (DMN) corresponds to total PTSD symptom severity. Despite these results, there is little research to date that has examined whether functional connectivity in these networks corresponds to specific PTSD symptom clusters. 
Methods: Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans were collected in 63 women aged 18-55 with PTSD. Seed-based functional connectivity analyses examined the relationship between connectivity in AN and DMN seeds and PTSD symptom clusters. 
Results: Total PTSD symptom severity was related to functional connectivity between numerous DMN seeds and middle frontal gyrus. PTSD symptom clusters were differentially related to resting state connectivity in both networks. Avoidance symptoms correlated with midline DMN connectivity while hyperarousal symptoms correlated with connectivity between a DMN seed and striatum. Re-experiencing symptoms were correlated with connectivity between the left amygdala seed in the AN and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. 
Conclusion: These results suggest that unique brain networks underlie the expression of PTSD symptoms. Outcomes from the present study may inform treatments targeting specific PTSD symptoms and corresponding brain systems.

Previous neuroimaging research identifies abnormalities in emotion-related brain regions in depression without HIV, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and amygdala. However, no studies have examined the neural signatures of depressive symptoms in acute HIV infection (AHI). Seed-based voxelwise resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) for affective seed regions of interest (pregenual ACC, subgenual ACC [sgACC], bilateral amygdala) was computed for 74 Thai males with AHI and 30 Thai HIV-uninfected controls. Group analyses compared rsFC of ACC and amygdala seed regions between AHI and uninfected control groups. Within the AHI group, voxelwise regression analyses investigated the relationship between depressive symptoms and rsFC for these affective seed regions. Group analyses revealed alterations in rsFC of the amygdala in AHI versus uninfected controls. Depressive symptoms associated with decreased rsFC between ACC regions and posterior cingulate/precuneus, medial temporal, and lateral parietal regions in AHI. Symptoms of depression also correlated to increased rsFC between ACC regions and lateral prefrontal cortex, sgACC, and cerebellum in AHI. Similar to the ACC, depressive symptoms associated with decreased rsFC between amygdala and precuneus. Of blood biomarkers, only HIV RNA inversely correlated with rsFC between posterior sgACC and left uncus. We found that depressive symptoms in AHI associate with altered rsFC of ACC and amygdala regions previously implicated in depression. Longitudinal research in this cohort will be necessary to determine whether these early alterations in rsFC of affective network regions are related to persistent depressive symptoms after combination antiretroviral therapy.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often co-occurs with mTBI and predicts worse clinical outcomes. Functional neuroimaging research suggests there are both overlapping and distinct patterns of resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) in mTBI versus PTSD. However, few studies have directly compared rsFC of cortical networks in military service members with these two conditions. In the present study, U.S. service members (n=137; ages 19-59; 120 male) underwent resting-state fMRI scans. Participants were divided into three study groups: mTBI only, PTSD only, and orthopedically injured (OI) controls. Analyses investigated group differences in rsFC for cortical networks: default mode (DMN), frontoparietal (FPN), salience, somatosensory, motor, auditory, and visual. Analyses were family-wise error (FWE) cluster-corrected and Bonferroni-corrected for number of network seeds regions at the whole brain level (pFWE < 0.002). Both mTBI and PTSD groups had reduced rsFC for DMN and FPN regions compared with OI controls. These group differences were largely driven by diminished connectivity in the PTSD group. rsFC with the middle frontal gyrus of the FPN was increased in mTBI, but decreased in PTSD. Overall, these results suggest that PTSD symptoms may have a more consistent signal than mTBI. Our novel findings of opposite patterns of connectivity with lateral prefrontal cortex highlight a potential biomarker that could be used to differentiate between these conditions.

However, the unique influence of anhedonia severity on reward circuit connectivity in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) remains unclear. To address this, we examined resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the ventral striatum as a function of anhedonia for individuals with PTSD. 

Methods: Resting-state functional MRI scans and behavioral assessments were collected for 71 women diagnosed with PTSD. Seed-based voxelwise rsFC analyses for left and right nucleus accumbens (NAcc) seed regions of interest were performed. Voxelwise regression analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between anhedonia severity and rsFC of left and right NAcc. 

Results: Results indicated that greater anhedonia severity was associated with reduced rsFC between the left NAcc and a cluster in the left caudate extending to the thalamus. This relationship between anhedonia and rsFC remained significant after controlling for PTSD symptom severity or depression severity. 

Conclusions: Our findings suggest that reward circuit dysfunction at rest is associated with anhedonia in PTSD. These results further contribute to our understanding of the neural correlates of consummatory anhedonia in psychiatric conditions.

Practitioners can play a valuable role in the social and emotional development of young children by providing supports early on that are relevant and appropriate. The four culturally responsive strategies described in this manuscript guide teachers in creating a classroom atmosphere that not only responds to children’s challenging behaviors but anticipates their needs. Through systematic implementation of these strategies and resources, teachers initiate sustainable relationships that provide young children from urban communities with an opportunity to grow and develop in nurturing classrooms where all children are valued. The more children get together and engage in prosocial interactions with teachers and peers, the happier everyone will truly be. ",Charis Lauren Price; Elizabeth A.

onset asynchronies (SOAs) of -1000, -500, -100 and 0 ms. Results showed semantic interference (SI) (i.e. significantly slower RTs in related compared to unrelated conditions) for all groups at -500, -100 and 0 ms, indicating timely spreading activation to semantic competitors. However, both PPA groups
showed a greater magnitude of SI than normal across SOAs. The PPA-L group and six PPA-G participants also evinced SI at -1000 ms, suggesting an abnormal time course of semantic interference resolution, and concomitant left hemisphere cortical atrophy in brain regions associated with semantic processing. These subtle semantic mapping impairments in non-semantic variants of PPA may contribute to the anomia of these patients.",Emily Rogalski; Christina Wieneke; Charis Lauren Price; Soojin Cho; Marsel Mesulam; Sandra Weintraub; Borna Bonakdarpour; Cynthia K Thompson,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,International,Research Board,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Co-author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

We investigate whether there are disparities in campaign contributions based on the race and gender of the candidates, as well as the race of donors. To test this, we examine campaign contributions in St. Louis City mayoral elections from 2011-2021, which include candidates who are Black, white, women, and men. We find significant differences in the campaign contributions women and Black candidates receive; results also show significant differences in the amount of money donors contribute by race. Our findings suggest that fundraising strategies for mayoral candidates are likely to vary substantially by candidate race and sex. This research is an essential step in increasing insight into the role of race and gender in local campaign finance and to better understanding municipal elections.</span></p>",Sapna Varkey; Anita Marie Manion; Jake Lynn Shaw; David C Kimball,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,National,College,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Co-author,Creating Whole Communities,,,,English,,Self-reported,

But, to what extent do beliefs about a perpetrator’s identity shape public support for efforts to prevent and punish voter fraud? Antipathy toward racial and ethnic groups is a strong predictor of public beliefs about voter fraud. Yet, prior studies have only been able to approximate beliefs about deviant behavior, and not specifically casting an illegal ballot. Drawing from sociology and criminology, we use a “typification” strategy that more directly measures which people are perceived as typical perpetrators of casting illegal ballots. We utilize nationally representative surveys of U.S. voters in 2017 – 2020  modules of the Cooperative Election Study (CES) to  apply and empirically test the typification theory. Among white respondents, we find that the typification of racially minoritized groups such as Blacks, Latinos, Arabs, and immigrants is widespread and is strongly associated with beliefs about voter fraud, support for restrictive election policies, and harsh punishment of illegal voting. The pictures of likely criminals that white voters carry in their heads shape their preferences for crime policies, and this extends to the domain of voter fraud.</span>",David C Kimball (Role:Author); Anita Marie Manion (Role:Author); Adriano Anthony A Udani (Role:Author),,,Blind Peer Reviewed,National,None,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Co-author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

<p>The convergence of trauma symptomatology, mental health symptoms, family and social difficulties, and intersectionality of diverse sexual and gender minority (SGM) individual issues is complex, multi-faceted, and challenging for the individuals in Cambodia who suffer them and for the therapists in Cambodia who meet individuals in treatment. We documented and analyzed the perspectives of mental health therapists in the context of a randomized control trial (RCT) intervention within the Mekong Project in Cambodia. The research questions explored perceptions of therapists’ care of mental health clients, therapist well-being, and experiences of navigating within a research environment in which SGM citizens with mental health concerns receive treatment.</p>
<p>The larger study enrolled 150 Cambodian adults, among which 69 identified as SGM. Three key patterns emerged across our interpretations. Clients seek help when symptoms interfere with daily life, therapists care for clients and themselves, and integrated research and practice is integral yet sometimes paradoxical. Therapists did not identify differences in terms of how they work with SGM clients compared with non-SGM clients.</p>
<p>Future studies are warranted to examine a reciprocal academic-research partnership in which we examine therapists’ work alongside rural community members, evaluate the process of embedding and fortifying peer supports within educational systems, and study the wisdom of traditional and Buddhist healers to address the discrimination and violence that citizens who identify as SGM disproportionately suffer.

This need for multiple perspectives requires mixed-methods research. Philosophy and practicality are needed to plan, conduct, and make mixed-methods research more broadly accessible to the health sciences research community. The traditions and dichotomy between qualitative and quantitative research makes the application of mixed methods a challenge. Aim To propose an integrated model for a research project containing steps from start to finish, and to use the unique strengths brought by each approach to meet the health needs of patients and communities. Discussion Mixed-methods research is a practical approach to inquiry, that focuses on asking questions and how best to answer them to improve the health of individuals, communities and populations. An integrated model of research begins with the research question(s) and moves in a continuum. The lines dividing methods do not dissolve, but become permeable boundaries where two or more methods can be used to answer research questions more completely. Rigorous and expert methodologists work together to solve common problems. Conclusion Mixed-methods research enables discussion among researchers from varied traditions. There is a plethora of methodological approaches available. Combining expertise by communicating across disciplines and professions is one way to tackle large and complex healthcare issues. Implications for practice The model presented in this paper exemplifies the integration of multiple approaches in a unified focus on identified phenomena. The dynamic nature of the model signals a need to be open to the data generated and the methodological directions implied by findings.",Roxanne Vandermause; Celestina Barbosa-Leiker; Janet Katz; Sterling McPherson,,,,,,,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Few studies assess both adolescents and caregivers' needs as adolescents transition to adult health care. Objective/Methods This study explored and compared the health-related independence experiences of 27 adolescents with ASD and their caregivers. Caregivers participated in focus groups and adolescents participated in semi-structured interviews Results Thematic analysis of dyads’ responses highlighted three common themes: (a) efforts toward independence, (b) low self-efficacy for adolescents’ independence, and (c) desire for independence. Nuances in responses indicated that although members of dyads shared many experiences, they were not communicating these experiences with each other Conclusions Results suggest both groups understand the importance of health-related independence and are motivated to achieve independence but lack skills and supports. Improved communication about experiences and goals between caregivers, adolescents, and the care team are needed. These findings can inform future interventions to better support adolescents’ transition to adult health care.<br>

Framed by an intersectional stance, this study aimed to identify patterns of barriers to help inform adherence interventions for the most at-risk people living with HIV (PLWH). Ethnographic data from two peer-led HIV medication adherence intervention studies (N = 35) in a large Midwestern U.S. city (2011 and 2014) were analyzed. Trained Peer Interventionists (e.g., the ethnographers) met with intervention participants for six weeks and wrote semi-structured field notes about participants’ adherence experiences. These notes were transcribed and analyzed using elements of theme and narrative analysis. All participants were HIV positive and not adherent to HIV medication. All participants were members of multiple minority or disadvantaged social groups. Participants experienced an average of 26.6 stressors over six weeks and 4.9 stressors in a single week, which were barriers to medication adherence. Stressors or barriers were characterized overall by four descriptive themes – severe, multileveled, connected, and variable. The most common stressors were physical illness (HIV and non-HIV related), mental health, isolation, poverty, homelessness, substance abuse, and hunger or poor diet. Successful interventions necessitate connections to various multileveled services that address trauma and multiple stressors, and are preferably available in one location. Research requires uncovering how individuals prioritize their stressors, to better understand the effect instability has on PLWH’s adherence patterns, and to determine the most appropriate points to intervene.<br>

Few anti-stigma interventions target undergraduate health professions students, although evidence supports reaching providers early in their training. We developed two different arts-based interventions based on Intergroup Contact Theory: a Photovoice intervention in which they viewed photo-stories of PLWH and a fiction writing intervention in which they developed characters with HIV. We present the results of a qualitative analysis of the post-intervention interviews, to elaborate on what and how students learned from both interventions. Via theme analysis, we identified three similar patterns among both sets of intervention participants. Interventions helped students to understand PLWH as ""people first,"" experience emotional responses to PLWH, and complicated their understanding of who was living with HIV. All three themes illustrate how Photovoice and fiction writing interrupted stereotypes about PLWH and humanized PLWH to health professions students.<br>

With elevated symptoms of poor mental health in conflict-affected settings, it is important to consider if and how mental health may be a risk factor for STIs in these settings. We used cross-sectional logistic regression to examine the association between symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with having been treated for an STI in rural South Kivu, Democratic Republic of the Congo. Among 753 adults, those with elevated self-reported symptoms of depression and anxiety (adjusted OR = 2.73, 95% CI 1.68, 4.44) and PTSD (adjusted OR = 1.89, 95% CI 1.17, 3.06) had higher odds of reporting ever being treated for an STI than those who were not symptomatic.

Methods: The Agency, comprised of 90 employees serving over 10,000 people annually, received federal funding to raise awareness about trafficking and to identify and support individuals at risk for trafficking through training, coalition building, direct outreach and service, and case management. We counted the numbers of tips and potential victims reported to the Agency by year, type of trafficking, economic sector, sex, region of origin, and age and looked for new risk factors of trafficking. Results: Data were available for 213 tips received between 2008 and 2017 and for 82 potential victims identified between 2011 and 2017. Labor trafficking (126 tips, 57 potential victims) was more common than sex trafficking (59 tips, 17 potential victims). The number of tips varied throughout the study. Tips and potential victims were diverse and included male and female children and adults. Most were from Mexico (n=68), the United States (n=47), Asia (n=31), and Central and South America (n=23). Potential victims were exploited in several industries including agriculture, construction, commercial sex, and landscaping. New risk factors for trafficking included exploitation within marriage and work in sales. Conclusions: Domestic and foreign-born men, women, and children are all at risk for labor and sex trafficking. Direct outreach to foreign-born victims should be a priority. The value of the new risk factors should be explored.<br>

We conducted a scoping review of the literature to identify evidence-based associations between mental health (depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD]) and factors related to HIV acquisition and progression in conflict-affected populations. Five electronic databases were searched on October 10, 2014 and updated on March 7, 2017 to identify peer-reviewed publications presenting primary data from January 1, 1994 to March 7, 2017. Articles were included if: 1) depression, anxiety, and/or PTSD was assessed using a validated scale, 2) HIV or HIV-related factors were a primary focus, 3) quantitative associations between depression/anxiety/PTSD and HIV or HIV-related factors were assessed, and 4) the study population was conflict-affected and from a conflict-affected setting. Of 714 citations identified, 33 articles covering 110,818 participants were included. Most were from sub-Saharan Africa ( = 25), five were from the USA, and one each was from the Middle East, Europe, and Latin America. There were 23 cross-sectional, 3 time-series, and 7 cohort studies. The search identified that mental health has been quantitatively associated with the following categories of HIV-related factors in conflict-affected populations: markers of HIV risk, HIV-related health status, sexual risk behaviors, and HIV risk exposures (i.e. sexual violence). Further, findings suggest that symptoms of poor mental health are associated with sexual risk behaviors and HIV markers, while HIV risk exposures and health status are associated with symptoms of poor mental health. Results suggest a role for greater integration and referrals across HIV and mental health programs for conflict-affected populations.<br><br>(Journal Impact Factor: 4.554; Citations: 20)<br><br>Author contribution: 80%<br>

Inductive and deductive techniques were used to analyze secondary data from a federally funded anti-trafficking program in a Midwest metropolitan area recorded between 2008 and 2017. Cases were included if there was indication of sex or labor exploitation initiated by an IP, family member, or other in the domestic setting via elements of abuse; 59 cases of 213 met this criteria. Most cases included the IP as the trafficker, followed by family members, then others in the domestic setting. Abuse was more commonly used than the threat of abuse. From the Power and Control Wheel, the most frequent types of abuse were using privilege, physical abuse, economic abuse, isolation, and sexual abuse. Case typologies included: those with elements of sex trafficking, specifically forced commercial sex by an IP or family member; those with elements of labor trafficking such as domestic servitude (with or without childcare provision abuse), exploitation in a family business by an IP or family member, or work environments by family and non-family; those with elements of sex and labor trafficking included servile partnerships and forced marriage. Trafficking exploitation by an IP, family member, or in the domestic setting is not uncommon. Intimate relationships with a trafficker, psychological coercion, and threats may reduce reporting of abuse, subsequent provision of services, and result in misclassification as victims of IP violence. This study sheds light on various typologies of trafficking and exploitation in the domestic setting, further expanding the anti-trafficking movement’s evidence base for intervention and prevention and adding complexity and nuance to the pathways to trafficking exploitation.</span><br><br>(Journal impact Factor: 2.621; Citations: 19)</p>

This study examined the effect a quasi-experimental intervention (prostitution diversion program, n=149) had on prostitution re-arrest compared to a waitlist control group (n=77) among N=226 individuals arrested for prostitution in Baltimore. In both groups, n=64 (28.32%) were re-arrested for prostitution over 30 months. Tests of differences compared groups with a significant difference in gender only. A cox proportional hazard model examined differences in survival time (to recidivist prostitution arrest) between individuals in the control and intervention groups at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 months. Only history of prior prostitution arrest was a significant predictor (HR=1.12, p = 0.02) of re-arrest. Lack of program success suggests that barriers to exiting prostitution are substantial, despite availability of supportive services. Future research should identify motivators for exiting and how to reduce exiting barriers.<br>

Of 1,898 citations identified, 22 studies were included. Studies included a mean of 18 (range 4-38) participants. Studies were of strong quality but lacked consistent procedures. Goals varied and projects included different combinations of introductory, photo training, ethics, group, individual, and exhibit sessions. Descriptions of the researcher-participant relationship were uneven. Photovoice allowed PLWH to inform research and practice priorities through their own visual perspectives. Continued use of Photovoice with PLWH is recommended with greater emphasis on consistent methods and detailed reporting; more studies should be undertaken resulting in actions or advocacy.<br>

Existing research has not examined the use of images on social media. This study explored the benefits and challenges of using visual social media to support health among ethnically/racially diverse middle-aged adults with HIV in a major midwestern city. This qualitative study utilized posters created from a parent photovoice project to explore participants’ (N = 15) use of social media, interest in viewing posters via social media, and interest in creating their own photo stories for social media. Benefits for social media use included connecting with other PLWH, education, and sharing empowering messages. Challenges were limited technical ability, dislike of/inappropriate use of social media, and concerns for anonymity. Our findings suggest that PLWH want to see photo stories of others living with HIV and that the benefit of viewers creating and sharing their own stories on social media is worth exploring.<br>

A public health approach has called for population-level assessment; however, identification of TIP victims lacks a standardised operational definition. This study applied the Prevalence Reduction Innovation Forum (PRIF) statistical definitions, developed by the US Department of State, to a community survey in Cape Town, South Africa. A high-risk sampling strategy was used. TIP screening questions from two instruments were matched with PRIF domain indicators to generate prevalence estimates. Sensitivity, specificity and receiver operating characteristics analyses were conducted to assess the performance of the two screeners. <strong>Setting</strong> Cross-sectional survey conducted in Cape Town, South Africa, from January to October 2021. <strong>Participants</strong> South Africans and immigrants from other nations residing in Cape Town and its surrounding areas, aged 18 or older, who met the study inclusion criteria for a set of experiences that were identified as TIP risk factors. <strong>Primary and secondary outcome measures</strong> Primary outcome measures were PRIF lifetime and past 12-month TIP positivity. Secondary outcome measures included individual and summary measures from the two screeners. <strong>Results</strong> Our PRIF algorithm yielded a TIP lifetime prevalence rate of 17.0% and past 12-month rate of 2.9%. Summary measures from each TIP screener showed an excellent range of predictive utility. The summary screener measures yielded statistically significant differences among some demographic and background categories. Several screener items were shown less predictive of the PRIF statistical definition criteria than others. <strong>Conclusions</strong> Prevalence estimates of probable TIP were higher than those reported elsewhere. Our TIP screeners yielded an excellent range of predictive utility for the statistical definitions, promising the potential for wider applications in global and regional TIP research and policymaking. A more systematic sampling strategy is needed even if statistical definitions become widely used.<br></span></span>

Erica,Koegler,(R) Guns and intimate partner violence among adolescents: A scoping review,Journal of Family Violence,8/14/2021,2020.0,36,605-617,,,Completed/Published,10.1007/s10896-020-00193-x,,,,Fall,2020,"Purpose: Intimate partner violence (IPV) among adolescents, or teen dating violence (TDV), is a significant public health issue that may affect up to two-thirds of youth aged 12–18. Gun violence among adolescents is similarly high, accounting for 18.7% of all firearm injuries from 2010 to 2016. Despite these statistics and evidence showing that TDV continues into adulthood as IPV, gun-related TDV has not received the same level of attention as adult IPV. In this scoping review, we are guided by the following questions: (1) what are the known risk and protective factors for gun-related TDV across micro (individual, interpersonal), mezzo (school, neighborhood), and macro (policy, social norms) domains? (2) What are the future directions for this area of research? Methods: We conducted a scoping review of eight academic databases to identify peer-reviewed studies examining risk and protective factors for gun-related TDV published in 1999–2019. Results: Our search returned few unique results (N = 16). Most of the published studies described the shared individual risk factors of gun carrying/access and TDV. Mezzo studies discussed TDV within the context of peer aggression or youth delinquency and gun carrying. There were zero macro studies meeting our search parameters. Conclusion: Our review suggests that adolescence may confer a unique blend of risk factors for both firearm and relationship violence, yet the intersection of these issues has received relatively little attention compared to gun violence in adult relationships. Areas for future inquiry involve increased surveillance of this issue and interventions addressing the shared risks for gun carrying/access and TDV. <br><br>(Journal Impact factor: 1.35; Citations: 13)<br><br>Author Contribution: 20%<br><br>

Exploitation has both short term and long-term impacts on the lives of the survivors but it continues to be a phenomenon that many are exposed to. Attention should be given to issues of exploitation to help prevent new incidents and continuous exploitation of people. Therefore, this paper focuses on exploring peoples’ subjective experiences of being exploited with a specific focus on the types of exploitative situations they are exposed to. This study sample consists of 417 adults residing in Cape Town and its’ surrounding areas, from which 84% were South African and 16% were migrants from other African countries. Data were collected using a structured survey with additional open-ended questions which were analysed through thematic analysis. The findings of the study reveal that study participants are vulnerable to multiple forms of exploitation including, sexual, psychological and physical abuse, intimate partner abuse, forced labour and lack of respect from the employers. In light of this, the study calls for the collaboration of different stakeholders including but not limited to the families, community, leaders, scholars, governmental and non-governmental sectors in the development and prioritisation of the implementation of strategies to prevent exploitation. This is not only essential in protecting and safeguarding the rights of individuals but also in building a just South Africa where everyone can thrive. <br><br></p>

Inclusion criteria were: 1) trauma was the predictor variable of the article, 2) at least one of two selected mental health conditions (depression and anxiety) was an outcome variable of the study, 3) the quantitative relationship between trauma and mental health was discussed; 4) participants of the study were adolescent refugees or asylum seekers; 5) the article was published between January 1, 2011 and August 30, 2020; 6) and written in English. Adolescents aged 12–18 of all genders were included in this review. Of 3319 potentially relevant articles identified, 11 articles were included. All the included studies employed a cross-sectional study design. Adolescent refugees experienced a variety of traumatic events, such as physical and sexual violence, war-related events, natural disasters, migration-related events, and verbal and emotional abuse. The review found a positive association between trauma exposure and poor mental health outcomes of depression and anxiety in all included studies across diverse adolescent refugee populations. The findings suggest that effective intervention strategies should be implemented to meet the needs of children and adolescent refugees as a vulnerable group in the host community as they adjust to the language, cultural, and school barriers and to support overall growth and development.<br></span></span>

TGNC health conferences can help, yet these events occur mostly in urban centers. Meanwhile, patients in non-metropolitan areas often face significant discrimination and notably poor access to TGNC care. This study explores the ongoing needs of TGNC patients and their providers following a one-day TGNC health conference in a small town in the American Midwest. Exploratory semi-structured interviews were used to gather in-depth information from TGNC conference attendees (N = 25). Theme analysis methods were used to identify areas of need for future trainings. Providers reported that they needed more exposure to TGNC patients, judgement-free opportunities to learn the basics about TGNC care, and ongoing trainings integrated into their medical school and ongoing education credits. Patients needed better access to care, more informed providers, and safer clinics. They cited lack of specialty care (e.g., mental health, surgery) as particularly problematic in a non-metropolitan setting. TGNC patients, and their providers in non-metropolitan areas, urgently need support. Patients lack specialized care and often possess greater knowledge than their health care teams; providers, in these areas, lack opportunities to work with patients and stay up to date on treatments.<br></span></span>

This data was derived from interviews with 15 service providers in a major metropolitan area. Findings revealed consistencies with previous literature and new insights into the trafficker- substance use dynamic. Traffickers’ use of substances with victims was pervasive when trafficking was for the purpose of sex but not other labour. There were several examples of how traffickers use substances for victim exploitation and recruitment. These include using substances to ensure a victim is in a euphoric mood prior to sex work, to reward victim sex work productivity, and to initiate withdrawal effects to demonstrate the traffickers’ supreme control. Novel findings include how and why traffickers might deny victim use of substances and how they might give substances to victims without the victim’s knowledge. Implications for how these findings can be utilised for victim treatment and for future research are discussed.<br><br></span></span>

Yet, gaps remain in our understanding of services needed and the best approaches to improve outcomes. Using cross-sectional electronic survey data from 107 service providers to human trafficking victims across Missouri, this study examines (1) victims’ service needs, (2) agencies’ ability to provide services, (3) victim sub-populations that agencies are able to serve, and (4) the rural/urban availability of anti-trafficking services. Findings Service providers, including social workers, counselors, law enforcement, and medical professionals reported that the most needed services for victims included case management, counseling, crisis services, shelter, and medical assistance. However, out of 15 possible victim services, only two were provided in-house by the majority of agencies. Additionally, respondents identified populations they were frequently unable to serve including incarcerated victims, tribal victims of violence, and refugees and immigrants. Urban counties were served by a significantly higher mean number of respondents compared to rural counties. Applications Findings raise concerns that some of the most critical services needed for best practice response may not be easily accessible for victims, particularly in rural regions. In addition, many providers are tasked with addressing multiple service needs with limited resources. Efforts to increase cross-discipline training, interdisciplinary collaboration, and funding for basic services are needed to ensure adequate and accessible services for survivors. Recommendations for future research and coordination of an effective response are noted.<br>

The Cross-Cultural Community Insights Matter (Triple C-IM) model was developed as a way to connect School Psychology training to meet current needs of local families and children.  Triple C-IM works to avoid assuming program curriculum perfectly addresses the needs of those who school psychologists serve in the field once they graduate. Instead, Triple C-IM humbly strives to partner with local community members in order to listen and learn how to improve training in order to respond to local needs through enhanced training. Triple C-IM works to accomplish this goal through university programs 1). Identifying cross-cultural community stakeholders to serve as School Psychology social justice advisory board members 2). Partnering with identified cross-cultural community stakeholders to map out and implement key areas for enhanced program social justice training 3). Utilizing cross-cultural community stakeholders in evaluation of program social justice learning outcomes.  

The model discusses long-term systems change and the process to create sustainable implementation of Triple C-IM within training programs. The aim of Triple C-IM is to create rich social justice training development infused within each year of the Ed.S degree. This formal alliance in Triple C-IM is critical to furthering social justice and engaging in advocacy that matters to communities served.

Despite these statistics and evidence showing that TDV continues into adulthood as IPV, gun-related TDV has not received the same level of attention as adult IPV. In this scoping review, we are guided by the following questions: (1) what are the known risk and protective factors for gun-related TDV across micro (individual, interpersonal), mezzo (school, neighborhood), and macro (policy, social norms) domains? (2) What are the future directions for this area of research? Methods: We conducted a scoping review of eight academic databases to identify peer-reviewed studies examining risk and protective factors for gun-related TDV published in 1999–2019.

Police-initiated post-traumatic stress symptomatology (PI-PTSS) refers to post-traumatic stress symptoms that are rooted in interactions with police officers. Research on PI-PTSS is scarce, though results typically suggest that invasive police behaviors are associated with higher levels of PI-PTSS.  However, this research utilizes a general measure of PI-PTSS, failing to account for unique profiles of PI-PTSS that may be present in the data. Further, research has yet to the relationship between PI-PTSS and co-morbidities. The present study utilizes latent class analysis (LCA) to identify profiles of PI-PTSS, tests predictors of latent class membership, and tests latent classes as predictors of depressive symptomatology. Findings from identified three profiles of PI-PTSS: low PI-PTSS, avoidance, and high PI-PTSS. The odds of belonging to the high PI-PTSS are greater for youth in low-income households, black youth, and youth who have been stopped by the police multiple times. Membership in the high PI-PTSS class is also associated with higher levels of depressive symptomatology.",Michael Gearhart; Sheila Barnhart; Annah Bender; Kristen A Berg; Courtney Jones,,,,,,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,"50%: Writing, analysis, editing, revisions",,,English,,Self-reported,4.0

Juvenile justice, policing, and trauma are key themes in the social work Grand Challenges, highlighting a need for social work researchers to study and address mental health issues that are rooted in the juvenile justice system. Research suggests that police encounters can be traumatic experience for youth. These experiences may result in trauma symptomatology and co-occurring mental health issues like depression and anxiety. However, studies exploring the relationships between trauma symptomatology, depression and anxiety do not typically focus on trauma that is rooted in experiences with the police. The present study utilizes exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis to examine the relationships among police-initiated post-traumatic stress symptoms, depression and anxiety. Our findings highlight the need to develop methods of disentangling the relationships between police-initiated post-traumatic stress symptomatology and co-occurring mental health symptoms, and advocating for policies and practices that can reduce negative police-youth interactions.",Michael Gearhart; Kristen A.

We conducted secondary analyses on climate survey (2013-2019; N=5344) and the bystander program (2015-2019; N=14,220) data. Paired sample t-tests examined pre- and post-test scores for the bystander program. Bivariate (chi-square) and multivariate (multinomial logistic regression) analyses of climate survey data examined associations of sexual assault victimization and perpetration by sociodemographic indicators. Knowledge improved significantly after completing the bystander intervention training (t[18,878]=-214.52, p<.001). Approximately 18% of students reported lifetime and 3.1% reported prior year sexual assault with higher victimization among female, bi/pansexual, and students with a disability. We were unable to statistically determine whether the bystander program impacted rates of sexual assault, however, it is possible that the program raised awareness of sexual assault generally, which could have led to increased reporting of past experiences.

The purpose of this study was to understand how older adults in recovery from substance use disorders experienced the transition from in-person to virtual 12-step meetings. We interviewed 11 older adults (age 50+) who self-identified as being members of 12-step programs. Participants completed an online survey including standardized measures assessing depression, anxiety, social isolation, and quality of life. Three themes emerged from interviews: Importance of the program; Promises and Limits of Technology; and Concern for Others. Participants’ high level of commitment to their groups enabled them to adapt quickly to virtual meetings. Participants described their concerns about members of their groups who were unable to make this transition.

Older adults in this study adapted quickly to virtual recovery groups. The social support participants received during groups, whether virtual or in person, may have acted as a buffer protecting them from the isolative effects of the pandemic.",Joseph G.

Juvenile delinquency has a negative effect on victims, communities, and the individual who commits a delinquent act.  However, exposure to the juvenile justice system can be a traumatic event that results in further delinquency – highlighting a need to develop community-based interventions to prevent delinquency.  Collective efficacy theory is a commonly used framework to prevent juvenile delinquency.  Although community-level interventions have been developed based on collective efficacy, research suggests that they are limited in their effectiveness.  This may be due to limitations in our conceptualization of collective efficacy, and our limited understanding of how perceptions of collective efficacy differ between youths and parents.  The present study utilizes data from the Fragile Families Child Wellbeing Study to test parent and youth perceptions of collective efficacy as predictors of self-reported juvenile delinquency.  The results indicate that – although collective efficacy is typically associated with lower levels of juvenile delinquency in neighborhoods – neither parents’ nor youths’ perceptions of collective efficacy are strong predictors of self-reported juvenile delinquency.  The findings suggest that focusing on youth, family, and neighborhood characteristics may maximize the effectiveness of interventions aimed at preventing juvenile delinquency.",Michael Gearhart,,,,,,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,100%,,,English,,Self-reported,0.0

Collective efficacy theory is a widely used theoretical framework for explaining how social cohesion is activated as collective actions.  Because collective efficacy was developed as a criminological theory, the majority of collective efficacy research focuses on the relationship between social cohesion and informal social control.  Conceptually, social cohesion can be activated as civic participation – particularly voting.  Although research examining voting behavior through a collective efficacy framework is scarce, findings suggest that collective efficacy is a useful framework for explaining civic participation.  However, previous research is limited because it lacks key predictors of voting – namely internal efficacy and external efficacy.  This study examines the relationships among social cohesion, internal efficacy, and external efficacy using a nationally representative sample of voters.  Findings support collective efficacy as a useful framework for increasing civic participation.  Further, social cohesion and internal efficacy are key factors predicting civic participation.",Michael Gearhart,,,,,,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,100%,,,English,,Self-reported,0.0

Mutual efficacy was developed as a bridge between the sociological and psychological conceptualizations of collective efficacy.

However, little is known about the individual and neighborhood-level characteristics that predict mutual efficacy.

Collective efficacy is a widely studied theoretical framework.  Originally operationalized as the combination of social cohesion and informal social control, collective efficacy theory is a predictor of multiple positive outcomes.  Conceptual and empirical critiques of collective efficacy theory suggest that social cohesion and informal social control should be modeled as unique constructs.   Further, the current model of collective efficacy theory does not include an explicit measure of efficacy.  Mutual efficacy, defined as community members’ beliefs that collective action will be successful at attaining group goals, will be developed in this manuscript.  The purpose of mutual efficacy is to make efficacy an explicit component within collective efficacy theory.  Three models of collective efficacy theory are compared in this study: (1) a one-factor model of collective efficacy that combines social cohesion and informal social control, (2) a two-factor model of collective efficacy that models social cohesion as a predictor of informal social control, and (3) a mutual efficacy model where the relationship between social cohesion and informal social control is mediated by mutual efficacy.

In sociology, collective efficacy refers to the process by which social cohesion is activated as informal social control.  In psychology, collective efficacy is a construct reflecting the perceived capability of a group.  Previous research supports mutual efficacy as a partial mediator of the relationship between social cohesion and informal social control.  However, mutual efficacy is theorised to be a task-specific construct.  This study contributes to our understanding of mutual efficacy by examining the relationships among social cohesion, mutual efficacy, and two actions: neighbouring and participation in organisations.

After controlling for multiple covariates that may influence flourishing, the models supported that higher levels of neighborhood social cohesion were directly associated with higher levels of flourishing adolescents, and indirectly by positive associations with family resilience for both children and adolescents. No indirect effects between neighborhood physical environments and flourishing were supported by the data for either children or adolescents. However, neighborhood physical environments were positively associated with adolescent flourishing.

Research on PI-PTSS is scarce, though results typically suggest that invasive police behaviors are associated with higher levels of PI-PTSS.  However, this research utilizes a general measure of PI-PTSS, failing to account for unique profiles of PI-PTSS that may be present in the data. Further, research has yet to the relationship between PI-PTSS and co-morbidities. The present study utilizes latent class analysis (LCA) to identify profiles of PI-PTSS, tests predictors of latent class membership, and tests latent classes as predictors of depressive symptomatology. Findings from identified three profiles of PI-PTSS: low PI-PTSS, avoidance, and high PI-PTSS. The odds of belonging to the high PI-PTSS are greater for youth in low-income households, black youth, and youth who have been stopped by the police multiple times.

Neighborhoods with higher levels of collective efficacy are associated with more favorable family outcomes such as lower teen pregnancy rates and less antisocial behavior among children. Collective efficacy is traditionally measured by combining the constructs of social cohesion and informal social control, yet these two constructs may have unique influences on family outcomes. While prior studies have examined collective efficacy’s factor structure, there is limited understanding of this construct among single mother families, who have unique social and economic characteristics. In this exploratory study, we tested a single-factor model and two-factor model separating social cohesion and informal social control to examine the underlying factor structure of collective efficacy with a diverse sample of 2,084 unmarried mothers who participated in the third wave in-home survey of the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing study.

Firearm-related violence is a significant threat to public health and safety in America.  However, research highlights a critical disparity in firearm-related deaths by race.  Researchers often cite implicit bias as a contributing factor for the racial disparity in firearm-related deaths.  In an effort to provide a foundation for potential social work interventions, the present study will test implicit biases towards four racial and ethnic groups (White, Black, Asian, Hispanic/Latino), fear of crime, and the quantity and quality of interactions with neighbors of a different race as predictors of gun ownership.  Findings suggest that implicit bias towards Black, Asian, and Hispanic/Latino individuals is a significant predictor of gun ownership.  Fear of crime and more frequent interactions with neighbors of a different race are also significant predictors of gun ownership.  Taken as a whole, findings suggest that gun owners are more likely to be more vigilant towards people of color because of stereotypical assumptions that racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to be involved with crime.  Social work practice and policy implications include developing interventions aimed at reducing implicit bias and identifying policies that are associated with lower levels of implicit bias among gun owners.",Kristen A Berg; Michael Gearhart; Courtney Jones; Sharon D Johnson,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,,,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,"60%: Writing, analysis, editing, revisions",,,English,,Self-reported,

Residential segregation has created a stark racial and economic divide in the United States.  Prior research suggests facilitating social interactions among diverse groups of neighbors is a particularly difficult – and particularly important step in addressing the legacy of segregation in the United States.  This study examines patterns of neighboring across race using latent class analysis, and identifies individual characteristics associated with frequent neighboring interactions across race.  Analyses found three typologies of neighboring: reluctant neighbors, limited neighbors, and individuals who actively neighbor across race.  Our findings highlight the complexity of studying neighboring – particularly neighboring across race, and demonstrate that neighboring typologies warrants future research – particularly as it relates to why an individual exhibits a particular pattern of neighboring across race.

In Malaysia, restorative justice is a relatively new concept in its criminal justice system and assessing the readiness of police officers in accepting the implementation of restorative justice in the police departments (i.e., restorative policing) is crucial. In this qualitative study, 28 police officers were interviewed regarding their readiness to accept the roles to implement restorative justice through the exploration of three key themes: ownership of crime, police culture, and acceptance of new roles. Our findings indicated that their readiness on the implementation of restorative justice appeared to have patterns which are categorized into cautious, in-the-box, and balanced. The different patterns of readiness provide illumination into implementing restorative policing in Malaysia through the different types of resistance shown.

Juvenile justice, policing, and trauma are key themes in the social work Grand Challenges, highlighting a need for social work researchers to study and address mental health issues that are rooted in the juvenile justice system. Research suggests that police encounters can be traumatic experience for youth. These experiences may result in trauma symptomatology and co-occurring mental health issues like depression and anxiety. However, studies exploring the relationships between trauma symptomatology, depression and anxiety do not typically focus on trauma that is rooted in experiences with the police. The present study utilizes exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis to examine the relationships among police-initiated post-traumatic stress symptoms, depression and anxiety.

Umit,Tokac,Building trauma responsiveness among nursing providers and community-dwelling adults   ,,,2021.0,,,,,In Progress,,,,,Spring,2023,"Problem. Globally about 30% of adults report four or more trauma exposures. A dose-response relationship has been established for trauma exposure and negative health outcomes. The cumulative effects of trauma exposure present a major public health issue in the US, long-term consequences that make sufferers at risk for future health problems such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, depression, diabetes, and premature mortality. Caring for individuals with traumatic stress takes a toll on nursing providers and community-dwelling adults.
Purpose. The purpose of this study was threefold: (a) describe responses before and after a trauma awareness and self-care training intervention focused on participant wellness, (b) to examine the association between pre-training compassion satisfaction score and post-training ARTIC participant attitudes, and c) to describe specific behavior changes that participants were willing to make.  
Methods. The training used a standardized curriculum and group interaction in a one-day session to facilitate learning. A convenience sample was used (n=96). Self-reported measures of attitudes, quality of life, and proposed behavior change were obtained.
Analysis. Bivariate regression analysis and thematic analysis of narrative responses were used to analyze the data.
Results. There was a significant difference between the pre-survey and post-survey total scores (F(1, 118) = 25.43, p<.001), and a positive relationship between Compassion Satisfaction at baseline and the total score of the ARTIC post intervention (F (1,58) =6.8, p<0.05), with an R2 of 0.10. The Alive and Well Program Evaluation asked participants, “what is one behavior you will change as a result of this training?” Six themes were found: self-awareness, self-care, empathy, the trauma lens, changing the narrative, and student centeredness.
Discussion. Our finding of the positive relationship between Compassion Satisfaction at baseline and the total score of the ARTIC post intervention was consistent with findings from previous studies. Qualitative findings that showed positive intentions to change in behaviors were similar to other studies that showed benefits of trauma awareness intervention studies.
Conclusions. Understandings of trauma and how it impacts communities are critical in building interventions for population level health promotion.

Umit,Tokac,Implementing a Novel Self-Care Clock Strategy as Part of a Trauma Awareness Intervention in a University Setting(R),Perspectives in Psychiatric Care,,2021.0,,,,,Submitted,,,,,Spring,2023,"Abstract

Objectives: Helping individuals with traumatic stress takes a toll on caregivers. Whether a Trauma Awareness Intervention with a novel self-care clock strategy can influence attitudes related to trauma-informed care is not known. The purpose of this study was to (a) examine attitudes after compared to before the intervention, (b) explore if higher pre-intervention compassion satisfaction is associated with higher post-intervention attitudes, and (c) describe specific self-care behavior changes participants are willing to make.

Methods: A quasi-experimental study and a qualitative content analysis were completed utilizing a sample of 96 adults. As part of a university initiative, we provided a half-day training using a Trauma Awareness Intervention, a standardized curriculum that also provides self-care strategies. Scales were administered and information on self-care behavior change was obtained.

Results: There was a significant improvement in total ARTIC scores after the intervention compared to baseline (F [1, 118] = 25.43, p < .001). Higher compassion satisfaction at baseline was related to more positive attitudes related to trauma-informed care after the intervention (p < 0.05). Themes about behavior changes were self-awareness, self-care, empathy, applying a trauma lens, changing the narrative, and student centeredness.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that using a trauma-informed care training with a self-care clock had a positive impact. However, whether interventions to enhance compassion satisfaction might lead to more positive attitudes related to trauma-informed care needs to be tested. Initiatives to get trauma-informed care interventions with self-care strategies to the general public are critical in building interventions for population-level wellbeing.
Clinical Impact Statement
Findings provide evidence that a short-term intervention package focused on trauma awareness information and self-care practices improves attitudes related to trauma-informed care. Two pragmatic approaches to extend study findings are proposed with corresponding inquiry questions. The first approach is to implement this intervention within collegiate core curriculum that requires service-learning projects. The corresponding question is: How do college students experience and apply the intervention lessons in their own service-learning projects? The second approach is to embed the intervention into professional development programs in service-focused organizations. The corresponding question is: How do professional development programs orient service professionals to build and sustain trauma-informed communities?

Whether a Trauma Awareness Intervention, part of a larger wellness program, can influence caregivers’ attitudes about trauma-informed care is not known. The purpose of the study was to explore the use of a Trauma Awareness Intervention with nurse and other caregivers at a university setting to test it before rolling it out to larger community groups. A unique self-care clock was used. Methods: A quasi-experimental study and a qualitative content analysis were conducted utilizing 96 adults. We used a standardized curriculum in a one-half day session and measured attitudes related trauma-informed care: underlying causes of problem behavior and symptoms, responses to problem behavior and symptoms, on the job behavior, self-efficacy at work, reactions at work, personal support of trauma-informed care, and system-wide support for trauma-informed care. Results: Using bivariate regression, there were improvements in attitude (p ≤ 0.05) after the intervention compared to baseline. Compassion satisfaction at baseline was related to attitudes after the intervention (β= 0.03, SE= 0.009). Themes about behavior change were: self-awareness, self-care, empathy, applying a trauma lens, changing the narrative, and student centeredness. Conclusion: The intervention including a self-care clock had a positive impact on nurse and community caregivers. An important theme, changing the narrative, suggests re-focusing attitudes from “what is wrong?” to wondering “what happened to individuals?"" that leads to behavioral responses. Understanding how trauma impacts individuals is critical in building future interventions for population-level health promotion.</p>",Allison Brauch; Julie E. Bertram; Anne F.

The health intervention increased activation levels in the sixteen participants by fostering congruency between faith, spirituality, and health. Quantitative methods were used and analysis of surveys. The health intervention placed participants in four health activation levels using the Patient Activation Measure (PAM), a ten-item questionnaire: Stage 1) Does not yet understand the role in managing health, Stage 2) lacks basic understanding and facts about health and the importance of following prescribed medication or health regimen, Stage 3) has the knowledge and understanding of self-health management and will develop and learn new skills to support new health information and behaviors, and Stage 4) are equipped to manage and adjust during relapses with health in moments of crisis.

Key Words:  Faith-based health initiatives, health disparities, community-based participatory research, self-care theory.

The manufacturer should offer only the buy-now alternative if its recourse production is much more costly than advance production. As the recourse production cost decreases, the manufacturer should add a second contract to the portfolio: initially the reserve contract and then the wait-and-see contract. However, when the recourse production is cheaper than advance production, the manufac- turer should drop the buy-now contract from the mix. As such, it is only in a small region, which shrinks with decreasing uncertainty in demand, that the manufacturer finds it optimal to offer all three 
purchasing alternatives.

Qiaohai,Hu,Strategic Outsourcing From a Rival: The Role of Sole Sourcing Commitment,Production and Operations Management,,2019.0,,,,,Revise & Resubmit,,,,,Fall,2019,"Focusing on cost drives, previous studies on horizontal outsourcing neglected the impact of sole sourcing commitment and competition form on firms' sourcing decisions. This paper fills this gap by studying horizontal outsourcing when the firms engage in Bertrand competition and with the possibility of sole sourcing commitment from a rival.  We adopt the framework of a duopolistic multi-stage game that comprised of an incumbent and an entrant. The incumbent has the technology know-how to make a key component in-house, and the entrant, who is a rival of the incumbent in the end product market,  can source the component either from the incumbent or from a supplier that does not participate in the end product market. We find that if the entrant commits to sole sourcing, horizontal outsourcing can occur when the incumbent has a component cost advantage or a small cost disadvantage over the noncompetitive supplier.  When the incumbent has a small cost advantage or disadvantage,  horizontal outsourcing softens downstream market competition. The benefit of price competition is significant so that the incumbent is willing to supply its rival at a loss and the entrant is willing to pay its rival at a price higher than the alternative supplier. If the incumbent has a significant cost advantage and the firms' products are more differentiated, then horizontal outsourcing may strengthen downstream price competition by expanding the total supply of end products. Without sole sourcing commitment, then horizontal sourcing commitment occurs only if the incumbent has a cost advantage, and it only strengthens downstream price competition by expanding the total supply of end products. In contrast, if the firms engage in Cournot competition, sole sourcing commitment is of no consequences and the entrant sources from its rival only if the incumbent enjoys a significant component cost advantage over the noncompetitive source.

Qiaohai,Hu,"Supply Chain Structure, Capital Structure and Product Market Competition",IISE Transactions,,2019.0,,,,,Revise & Resubmit,,,,,Fall,2019,"Existing literature demonstrates that debt financed firms will compete with each other more aggressively than equity financed ones. However, it is not clear how  supply chain structure may  affect this result. This paper  addresses this issue by  studying two  supply chain structures: two  competing retailers source from a common supplier  or  two dedicated suppliers.  I show that the  dedicated suppliers  lower their wholesale prices to induce their retailers to compete more aggressively  when at least one retailer borrows, whereas the common supplier  keeps  its wholesale prices invariant to the downstream retailers' debt.  Consequently, the competition intensifying effect of debt financing is more pronounced, the retailers borrow more and incur a high default risk  with two  suppliers than one. Although the retailers are worse off than not borrowing, the upstream supplier(s) is better off.  Interestingly,  in the asymmetric setting where only one retailer is leveraged, the leveraged retailer obtains a first-mover like advantage, and  this advantage trickles up to  its supplier in the model with two suppliers.  Counter-intuitively, the presence of financial distress costs  may  improve  rather lower the retailers' profits by curtailing the retailers' incentives to borrow, and thereby mitigates the competition intensifying effect of debt. However, because  financially distress exerts a negative externality on the supply chains, it forces the supplier(s) to lower  wholesale prices and sell less to the retailers and thus earn less under both supply chain structures. Additionally, the retailers' debt is a U-shaped function of the degree of product substitution, and that the debt level is monotonically decreasing in the  coefficient of  demand  variability.

Qiaohai,Hu,Subscription Selling: the Role of Consumer Valuation Uncertainty and Competition,Production and Operations Management,,2019.0,,29,,,Revise & Resubmit,,,,,Spring,2019," As subscription  becomes increasingly popular, it is important to understand  when it is more profitable than traditional selling. The literature offers the following explanation: subscription benefits  firms because it enables them to price-discriminate among heterogeneous consumers. This study reveals two new drivers of subscription: an inter-temporal pooling effect in the presence of consumer valuation uncertainty and a competition softening effect.  Consumers subscribe as long as their expected net surplus across periods is nonnegative, whereas they defer their purchase decision after they learn their production valuation under traditional selling. The  inter-temporal pooling effect of subscription attracts consumers who will not purchase under traditional selling to purchase now and also subscribe for future periods, essentially eliminating firms' ex-post information disadvantage. As a result, traditional selling only is suboptimal. A firm should sell only through subscription if consumer valuation uncertainty is moderate; otherwise, it should supplement subscription with traditional selling. Offering a partial refund to subscription is suboptimal in a monopoly setting.  With imminent competition,  subscription  softens anticipated price competition; the firm can either maintain its monopoly status quo  by offering no refund to subscription cancellation or soften the price competition by offering a partial refund to  subscription cancellations.  In contrast,  under traditional selling, the firm competes head-on with an entrant, eliminating both firms'  profit.

Qiaohai,Hu,"Specific Capacity Investment, Sourcing Contract with Renegotiation",IISE Transactions,,2019.0,,32,,,Submitted,,,,,Spring,2019,"In  a supply chain composed of a supplier and a buyer, the supplier  must make two decisions, the buyer-specific capacity  and cost reduction investment for each unit of the installed specialized capacity before uncertainties have been resolved. Because the firms cannot make firm contracting terms ex ante, the supplier often under-builds the capacity and under-invests in the cost reduction innovation.  This paper aims to identify contracts so that the supplier will build and invest in specialized capacity at the first-best level with or without ex post renegotiation after uncertainties have been resolved. Under quantity-only  contracts  the supplier will not agree to build the specialized capacity without potential ex post renegotiation, and it will over-invest but under-build the specific capacity with renegotiation. In contrast, under price-only contract the supplier will under-invest but over-build the specific capacity. Ex post renegotiation improves the channel profits and hence the firms' but does not solve the under-built and under-investment problem.  Quantity plus recourse price initial agreement or option contract can induce the supplier to make channel-efficient decisions with or without renegotiation. However, ex post renegotiation improves the channel  efficiency and therefore the firms' profits. Due to the flexibility of option contracts, the firms renegotiate only if the buyer exercises up options and want to buy more ex post, while ex post renegotiation occurs with certainty under the quantity plus price initial contract.

To avoid double taxation, it permits tax cross-crediting. Through this strategy, global firms can use excess foreign tax credits (FTCs), the portion of foreign tax payments that exceed their home country tax liabilities, generated from a subsidiary located in a high-tax country to offset the tax liabilities of their low-tax divisions. This paper studies manufacturing capacity decisions in the subsidiary of an MNF with tax cross-crediting. Casting the problem on a newsvendor model, and assuming the objective of maximizing the global firm’s worldwide after-tax profits, we show that the optimal capacity decision under the effects of tax cross-crediting can behave very differently from that of the traditional newsvendor model. In particular, we show that an improvement in the firm’s after-tax profitability (through tax cross-crediting, an increased profit margin, or a reduced  tax rate) might reduce the optimal capacity and that the optimal capacity decision under certain circumstances can be made without the knowledge of the demand distribution. We also discuss the issue of motivating the division manager to use an after-tax performance measure with a managerial tax rate.

Qiaohai,Hu,Sourcing From a Rival: Buy Now or Wait,Production and Operations Management,,2019.0,,31,,,Submitted,,,,,Spring,2019,"This paper studies how the timing of sourcing quantity decision under horizontal sourcing affects the firms’ downstream price game:  commit to an order quantity in advance or postpone       it after the price game is settled. Horizontal sourcing may occur as long as there is a cost gap between the firms. If the cost gap is large relative to the degree of consumer heterogeneity, and the sourcing price is moderate, quantity commitment enables the buyer to obtain a larger market share than it would under making-in-house, drives retail prices down, reduces the aggregated consumer traveling costs, and therefore improves consumer surplus; the seller recoups the loss due to market share erosion from the profit gleaned in the component market.  Committed sourcing resulting in      a win-win-win scenario. If sourcing price is high, or if the cost gap is small, committed horizontal sourcing will not affect the price game. In contrast, non-committed sourcing equalizes the firms’ downstream market shares and retail prices, and makes the entrant’s profit invariant to the sourcing price. It may intensify the price game if the cost gap is small; and soften it, otherwise. As the sourcing price increases, or as the cost gap increases, the firms first prefer committed then switches to non-committed sourcing. If sourcing price is set by the firms, letting the cost-efficient firm set it yields the highest industry level profit and social welfare, and both firms will prefer non-committed to committed sourcing.

In addition, we find that optimal coordinated decisions, in comparison with decentralized ones, yield lower inventories, require less cash, take larger short-term loans,  incur a lower probability of financial distress, and yield higher expected dividends net of capital subscriptions. Moreover, long- and short-term debts are substitutes; an optimally leveraged firm needs less long-term debt if it coordinates its short-term decisions than if it decentralizes them.

Qiaohai,Hu,Capital Structure and Supply Chain Capacity Investment,Production and Operations Management,,2019.0,,40,,,Submitted,,,,,Spring,2019,"Because of long lead time associated with capacity investment, a supplier must build the capacity far in advance of the buyer’s production. Due to the uncertainties involved, the supply chain partners cannot commit ex ante to firm future trade terms through court-enforceable contracts. Instead, they rely on informal initial agreement and ex post bargaining. Bearing the full upfront cost, the supplier will under-build the capacity. This paper shows that if the supplier is allowed to recapitalize and borrow after capacity is built, it may use capital structure to influence bargaining with its buyer and thus may adjust its capacity investment ex-ante accordingly. However, the relationship of the capacity and debt is not as simple as the existing literature suggests;  that  is, the supplier will borrow and expands capacity. This paper shows that if the supplier is very powerful, it will finance the capacity with a mixture of debt and equity, and build capacity even lower than if it were equity financed. In this range of power structure, surprisingly, the supplier’s profit improves as the buyer’s bargaining power increases. For a more balanced power  structure,  the supplier may or may not borrow. If it borrows, it will finance the capacity with 100% debt and over-build capacity. If the buyer is very powerful, the supplier will not agree to build capacity if not allowed to issue debt; however,  it will overbuild capacity and finance capacity entirely with debt if  it is allowed to borrow. In this case, debt financing is Pareto optimal.

After uncertainty is resolved, the retailers may trade stock with each other. In addition, they may purchase more from the manufacturer. We identify sufficient conditions for  the existence of pure-strategy equilibria and obtain sufficient conditions for advance stage procurement and recourse stage trading to occur. These structural properties are used in a numerical study that sheds insights into the manufacturer’s and retailers’ procurement contract design preferences and 
how these preferences are affected by production cost structure and demand variability.

Qiaohai,Hu,Global Sourcing Decisions for a Multinational Firm with Foreign Tax Credit Planning,IISE Transactions,,2019.0,,,,,Accepted,,,,,Fall,2019,"Various countries’ tax laws adopt certain forms of a so-called worldwide tax system which levy taxes on their countries’ multinational firms’ global incomes at home country tax rates. To avoid double taxation, they permit tax cross-crediting, i.e., a global firm can use excess foreign tax credits (the portion of foreign tax payments that exceed its home country tax liabilities) generated from a subsidiary (located in a high-tax country) to offset the tax obligations from another subsidiary (located in a low-tax country). This paper studies a multinational firm’s global sourcing decisions at two subsidiaries located in low- and high-tax countries, respectively, with an objective of maximizing its expected worldwide after-tax profit. We characterize the optimal sourcing decisions under various decentralized and centralized after-tax profit-maximizing performance measures. We show that the global firm can devise an easily implementable incentive scheme to optimally coordinate the decentralized sourcing decisions made at the two subsidiaries. We also demonstrate that decentralized policies with after-tax performance measures are more advantageous than the traditional pretax policies when the “tax effects"", i.e., the impacts of certain features of the tax laws (such as tax cross-crediting) on supply chain decisions, are significant.

During the pandemic, some states have required their inmates to produce resources for fighting COVID-19. In New York, inmates are now producing hand sanitizer – an item that is contraband within prisons. Ellis raises the question of how ethical it is to require imprisoned people to produce items at substandard wages for the community’s benefit. Ellis’ essay reminds us that prison labor is all around us. It may be seen in a license plate on a car or in a hospital where healthcare providers use inmate produced hand sanitizer.""

Although managers have struggled with SKU proliferation for decades, research has provided inconsistent guidance, and the cross-functional and cross-firm aspects of the problem were not considered. The purpose of this paper is to explore the factors that favor successful and sustainable SKU rationalization.

Design/methodology/approach
A single case study was used to investigate the implementation of an SKU rationalization project by a national restaurant chain in collaboration with its food distributor. Qualitative data analysis techniques were used to understand managers’ perceptions about the SKU rationalization problem and the financial results that were achieved.

Findings
The findings include seven propositions that begin to formalize theory for SKU rationalization. Cross-functional involvement was both a challenge and a critical success factor, and the supplier was an important resource for managing product variety and complexity.

Research limitations/implications
Seven propositions are provided that increase the likelihood of successfully dealing with SKU proliferation.

Practical implications
SKU proliferation increases supply chain complexity and leads to higher costs. The research reports on an SKU rationalization project that saved a company and its supplier $6.7m.

Originality/value
A previously unexplored theoretical perspective on SKU rationalization was employed that emphasizes cross-functional alignment, buyer–supplier relationships and the impact on financial performance of a firm.",Matias G Enz (Role:Author); Matt A Schwieterman (Role:Author); Douglas M Lambert (Role:Author),Yes,Basic or Discovery Scholarship,Blind Peer Reviewed,International,Research Council,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Lead / Corresponding author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Executives in manufacturing firms have benefited from frameworks created to implement SCM processes, but this is not the case for their counterparts in service companies. The two most cited SCM frameworks for services have methodological and conceptual deficiencies. Drawing upon the service-dominant logic of marketing and using an empirical research approach, we developed supply chain structure maps for nine service firms. Our findings indicate that the supply chain structure maps of service companies are comparable to those in the product-based literature, which supports the service-dominant logic. Then we identified the six key processes that constitute a framework to manage service supply chains. The customer relationship management and the supplier relationship management processes form the critical links in the supply chain and the other four processes are coordinated through this linkage. The service SCM framework provides direction for executives in service firms who need to increase cross-functional integration within their firms and with other members of the supply chain.

Literacy is complex and teaching literacy even more complex. Additionally, because students’ needs change from generation to generation, research on literacy and instruction must evolve, making evidence-based practices that meet the literacy needs of students a moving target. In 2020, the Show Me Literacies Collaborative won a federal grant with the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE). The Show Me Literacies Collaborative began our work by supporting teachers to design literacy action plans for their school. The creation of teacher-generated literacy action plans presents rich opportunities for schools to address and respond to the complexities of literacy instruction. We start this article with an expanded definition of literacy that recognizes the multi-faceted nature of language and literacy. We then describe what literacy action plans are and conclude with our guiding principles for creating teacher-generated literacy action plans.</p>",Tracy L.

The articles in this special issue illustrate the unique local groundings, personal educational experiences, and communities of inquiry emergent from critical global perspectives and point to the importance and distinctiveness of regional and cultural context, the need to analyze power and privilege, and the need to iteratively denaturalize the naturalness of one’s own perspectives in developing in-service and pre-service teachers. In considering the collection of special issue manuscripts as a whole, we had the opportunity to codify what the emerging field of global teacher education considers critical global teaching.  Across the articles we identified four features of teacher’s praxis that prompt deep criticality: glocality, reflexivity, interculturality and worldmaking. These features are not linear, but rather overlapping, layered, and dynamic. They are intended to evolve through educators’ praxis in their contexts, as such, praxis runs across all four features. The article defines and elaborates on each of the four features using quotes from the special issue manuscripts as examples.

This multiple case study examines the writer identity of two PSTs from a midwestern university in the United States. Data collection included a visual metaphorical representation, participant generated reflections in class, and participate generated reflections in practicum. The data suggest that contrasting writer identities exist among preservice ELA teachers and that PSTs can have multiple writer identities that are at odds with each other. One focal participant saw the potential harm of a structured approach to writing instruction that challenged her beliefs and values on writing and writing instruction. Another focal participant wrestled with a separate account of a structured approach to writing instruction, understanding the practical needs in an era of standardized testing while recognizing that such instruction can be limiting. This manuscript reveals the importance of identity work in preservice teacher education courses by asking PSTs to reflect on and later to interrogate their writer identities, contrasting their discoveries with the research on writer-teacher education.

Thus, developing cosmopolitan literacies among students and teachers becomes ever more important. Believing that cosmopolitan literacies are central to being literate in contemporary times, the authors build on their existing project‐based inquiry model to include global themes (e.g., poverty, global water and sanitation, climate change) and cross‐cultural exchange. This theory‐into‐practice article explains the Project‐Based Inquiry Global process and six design features that enable teachers to facilitate collaborative inquiry projects with their students. As students interact during the process, they begin to practice cosmopolitan literacies by engaging in reading, writing, and inquiry with people and topics from around the world, becoming cross‐cultural difference makers.

However, previous research in Indiana has shown that even teachers who believe that global education is important may not be teaching it. The purpose of this study was to describe current K-12 Indiana public school teachers’ description of their practices that promote students’ global readiness using the Teaching for Global Readiness Scale. The conceptual framework Teaching for Global Readiness is an empirically validated model of four dimensions: situated practice in the local context, integrated global learning with the standard course of study, instruction from a critical frame, and transactional experiences where students engage in active learning through intercultural collaboration. Overall, teachers scored highest on the subscale of situated practice (e.g., valuing diversity, breaking down stereotypes), and lowest on transactional experiences that involved technology for cross-cultural collaboration. Teaching experience and travel abroad were not found to be a determining factor for being able to teach for global competence.

On the one hand, inquiry is about learner agency in what and how they learn. On the other hand, critical literacy is about looking at systemic issues. One approach forefronts the personal, the other the political. Effectively integrating the two can be challenging. Part of how we came to this tension is that we both individually had conducted inquiry projects with students. Katie had designed an inquiry around a local issue and Shea around a global issue, but we both had designed the inquiries with the goal of raising students’ critical consciousness. We use the analogy of zooming, to describe how teachers can guide students to zoom in and out and back again throughout an inquiry in order to focus on personal knowledge, political systems, and agency. In this way, students’ are able to see both their proximity to an issue and to analyze the issue from a distance.

The purpose of this case study was to explore preservice English teachers’ reading identities and their perceptions of reading identity development in the context of English classrooms. This study used qualitative collective case design. Data sources included analogy exercise about participants’ reading identities, participant-generated observations of reading identity instruction, questionnaire on reading identity, class discussions about reading identity and final written reflection. Data showed examples of participants’ reading identities as taking a variety of forms, but when discussing what shaped their reading identities, the strongest codes related to positive interactions with people and texts. The data showed that participants related positive reading identities to both reading to learn and reading for pleasure. More participants’ perceived their professional identity as that of a literature teacher than a reading teacher. Future research is needed on how to support preservice teachers’ positive reading identities in English education courses. Our data suggest that learning about reading identity may help preservice English teachers think of reading as something that is developing in themselves as well as their students over a lifetime. By providing space in English methods programs to attend to preservice teachers’ reading lives, we can help them rekindle or find their love of reading. This research is needed because helping preservice teachers construct and enact positive reading identities in turn aids guidance of their future students’ reading identities, and having a positive reading identity is in turn linked to positive student outcomes.

Shea,Kerkhoff,#MeToo in English education,English Education ,,2018.0,51,16-Apr,1,http://www.ncte.org/library/NCTEFiles/Resources/Journals/EE/0511_oct2018/EE0511Oct18Editorial.pdf,Completed/Published,,,,,Fall,2018,"This editorial is about #MeToo in our field, English education. As we shared the experiences that informed our different perspectives, it dawned on us that soliciting input from the ELATE membership would make for richer content and help us do justice to a movement that gained its momentum through the disclosure of stories. To that end, we developed a Qualtrics survey comprised of multiple-choice, numeric-scale, and open-response items. We hesitate to draw on the language of research. We don’t pretend a scientific rigor in our methods because getting at the “truth” of #MeToo in our field wasn’t our aim. We were not expecting the sheer volume of data we received, though, so conventional research methods helped us get a handle on it. Deciding what to focus on for this editorial wasn’t easy. We ultimately chose to highlight recurring themes that most resonated with our respective stances. For Tara, seeing shades of grey  and saying “yes, but . . .” date back to her dissertation days of investigating teacher-student relationships, so questions around blurred lines and ambiguity came to the fore. Shea, though, likes definition and action—to be able to clearly identify the problem at hand and come up with viable solutions for glocal change—so she gravitated toward responses that suggested a pathway to what’s next. We share the responses with these two themes as the organizational structure: blurred lines and what's next.  Our prose can’t capture the extent or the depth of the data, though, so we have interspersed the editorial with text boxes containing sound bites that we hope convey a sense of the pain, frustration, and occasional glimpses of hope that pervaded the open responses. We’ve also condensed results that lent themselves to data tables to give readers a sense of where the numbers fell, though we don’t have the space here to discuss every item. We hope #MeToo and Time’s Up normalize conversations about sexual harassment and abuse in
a way that makes such conversations possible in teacher education contexts
today, commonplace in the near future, and one day unnecessary.

We utilized qualitative exploratory case study methods to investigate 24 pre-service teachers in our two university YA literature courses as they read and discussed All American Boys. Thematic analysis consisted of open coding through the theoretical lenses of critical literacy and critical race theory.

After defining disciplinary literacy in the four core disciplines of English, science, social studies, and mathematics, we developed scales for each discipline and administered it to a snowball sample of professionals nationwide, with 857 respondents. Data showed evidence of disciplinary literacy as a multidimensional construct with three related factors: source literacy, analytic literacy, and expressive literacy. Based on EFA and CFA results, we can conclude that there are at least three types of literacy in operation among the four core disciplines. The three factors of literacy varied significantly by the four core disciplines of English/language arts (ELA), science, history and social studies, and mathematics, supporting the notion that each discipline uses literacy uniquely. This was the first study of its kind to attempt to define, quantify, and validate the construct of disciplinary literacy.

We utilized case study methods to describe Kenyan teachers’ perceptions of innovative teaching and digital literacy while participating in the Inquiry Initiative, a three-day professional development series. Data sources included pre- and post-surveys, participant-generated artifacts, and interviews. Overall, participants embraced learner-centered teaching theoretically but found the lack of technological resources created barriers to teaching digital literacy in a learner-centered fashion. To solve technology challenges, teachers described having students work in groups and using smartphones.

Speaker 2: Bighorn sheep). To foster the development of advanced language, Sunderbeg and Sundberg (2011) proposed prerequisite skills that may engender the emergence of novel, convergent intraverbals. We used a multiple-probe design with both nonconcurrent (across participants) and concurrent (across stimulus sets) components to evaluate the effects of training these prerequisite skills on the emergence of convergent intraverbals with four children with autism. Participants showed the emergence of convergent intraverbals at mastery levels after they displayed mastery performance on all of the prerequisite skills identified by Sundberg and Sundberg, lending support to their characterization as prerequisites.

Andresa,De Souza, Using a Treatment Package to Decrease Disruption Behavior Maintained by Automatic Reinforcement,,,2019.0,,,,,In Progress,,,,,Spring,2023,"Relatively little research has been devoted to the treatment of problem behavior maintained by automatic reinforcement, in particular when the topography of problem behavior involves automatically maintained disruption. Data from the existent literature suggest that consequent interventions might be more effective than antecedent interventions to promote socially significant changes in problem behavior maintained by automatic reinforcement (Rapp & Vollmer, 2005). The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the effects of a treatment package on the levels of disruptive behavior hypothesized to be automatically maintained, of an 11-year-old boy with autism in a school site. We used a multiple baseline design across settings to demonstrate the effects of the treatment on the levels of problem behavior. The treatment package included differential reinforcement of alternative behavior (DRA; i.e., keeping hands close to his own body), blocking and overcorrection of target disruptive behavior. The results demonstrated that the treatment package was effective in decreasing the levels of disruption across all settings. The outcomes of the current study provide a potential treatment option for behavior maintained by automatic reinforcement. We will discuss these results in terms of the basic principles responsible for behavior change.",Virginia Gimenez (Role:Author); Andresa A De Souza (Role:Author),,,,International,,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Lead / Corresponding author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

In this study, we first taught a boy with ASD two initial mands. Immediately thereafter we brought those mands under the conditional discriminative control of a four-component multiple schedule with (a) S1 correlated with one reinforcer available (i.e., edibles), (b) S2 correlated with both reinforcers available (i.e., edibles or drink), (c) S3 correlated with another reinforcer available (i.e., drink), and (d) SΔ correlated with no reinforcer available.

Years of empirical research have repeatedly demonstrated and validated the effectiveness of applied behavior analysis (ABA) as the basis for the intervention for children with autism. Different prevalence rates of ASD are observed on a global scale, and most countries in the world do not have the same level of accessibility to quality ABA services as the United States of America (USA). This is the case in Austria, which currently has only one certified behavior analyst countrywide and only a few sites offering interventions based on ABA. Barriers to the delivery of interventions in Austria involve the complete absence of behavior analysis in Austrian research and higher education programs; limitations related to funding and insurance coverage; and licensure requirements and recognition of behavior analysts as a profession. In this article, we will present our analysis and experience navigating some of these barriers and describe the efforts put forward to overcome the issues of dissemination and barriers for service delivery.

This is the case in Austria, a country in Eastern Europe with great diversity among its inhabitants. It is very likely that the behavior analyst working in Austria will face potential cultural differences due to the presence of cultural diversity. Although technical competency is important to ensure clients will receive the most effective interventions, it is also essential that providers are aware of and responsive to the cultural context to guarantee that clients’ preferences, based on their values, are incorporated into the intervention plan and its strategies. Barriers to culturally sensitive services might involve the differences between the values and cultural practices of families, as well age differences, and the service provider. To overcome these barriers, the behavior analyst should evaluate their own culture incompetency while practicing cultural humility. This could involve the development of cultural awareness, the acquisition of cultural knowledge, and the emission of culturally responsive behaviors. In this article, we will present an overview of some potential cultural barriers and suggest practical steps to overcome cultural differences during service delivery.

We examined the implementation and outcomes of ""community conversation"" events held in 6 geographically and economically diverse locales. Each event used an asset-based dialogue approach called the World Café ( Brown & Isaacs, 2005 ) to solicit ideas from a broad cross-section of community members on improving integrated employment that reflect local priorities and possibilities. Six key themes encapsulated the 1,556 strategies generated by the almost 400 attendees. Although considerable consistency was found among the categories of strategies raised across events, the manner in which those individual strategies would be implemented locally reflected the unique accent of each community. Attendees also viewed these events as promising and productive pathways for identifying next steps for their community.

Findings revealed three key themes: (1) Affinity and Action, (2) Individual Experience of Discrimination, and (3) Systemic Racism and Discrimination Impacting Students of Color. Participants were passionate about advocating for all students and liberating marginalized students from oppressive school structures. However, participants' own experiences with discrimination impacted their well-being and job satisfaction. The participating women utilized several strategies to cope and push for change (e.g., reporting to the human resource personnel). Yet, people in power precluded their efforts and the emotional toll led some participants to question whether they should transition to a new field of practice. Findings from this research support calls for increased attention to Black women in school mental health fields, because they are placed at risk of experiencing work discrimination due to their intersectional identities.</span><br><br><br>Journal Information: The Impact Factor of the Journal of School Psychology 6.033, with a Cite Score of 7.0.

However, school psychologists must continue to find ways to more effectively reduce the gap between research and practice, supporting educational outcomes for all students. Two interconnected strategies that may help bridge this gap include implementation and de-implementation science. Implementation science focuses on adopting practices that have a strong evidence base, and there is some evidence of this practice in school psychology research. However, we identified no research in school psychology in the area of de-implementation science, which focuses on identifying and removing practices that do not have a strong evidence base. We urge school psychology researchers to actively engage not only in implementation but also in de-implementation in order to inform practice and to reach these goals. We provide two examples where school psychology can contribute to this area: reading instruction and mental health services.

(In Revision). Immigrant mental health: Using intersectionality and interdisciplinary practices to promote equity in school-based services. School Psychology Review.<br><p> Immigrant-origin children provide unique challenges for school psychologists and the schools they support. One way to conceptualize the identity of these students is through the lens of intersectionality, which provides context for their lived experience. In addition to factors such as socioeconomic status and race, immigrant-origin children are both bilingual and bicultural. They also share a set of experiences that have the potential to expose them to trauma, as well as qualities that support their resilience and success in their new country. While school psychology often utilizes a deficit perspective, related fields such as counseling psychology can provide a framework for using a strength-based approach. This article provides details on the complex factors forming the identity of immigrant-origin children and provides a positive approach to supporting them in the schools.</p>

<p>The absence of ID-specific psychology training perpetuates pathologizing and diagnostic overshadowing in the ID population; prevents services providers from understanding and supporting their clients; and results in health and educational disparities. This manuscript will delve into the intersection of disability studies and graduate training in psychology and offer curricular strategies for advancing programmatic change for more inclusive service delivery. Meaningful supports needed to (a) fully and effectively utilize proposed curricular strategies and (b) counter physical, programmatic, systemic, and attitudinal barriers within our current training models will be presented.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We will introduce implementation drivers (e.g., disability as diversity, universal design for learning, disability in discussions of power and privilege, dismantling personal unconscious biases) for addressing ableism in course design, course materials, and course work. Using Disability Studies and Disability Justice as our foundation, we will provide a roadmap for preparing ethical, just and inclusive practitioners, trainers, and researchers who will serve and advocate with children with ID and their families.</p>

(Submitted January 2023). Promoting Effective Practice by Problem-Solving Teams Through Intervention Technology. Journal of Educational and Psychological Consultation.
<p>Intervention technology refers to best practices related to intervention selection, implementation, and evaluation and used by problem-solving teams (PSTs) to promote team effectiveness and student outcomes. The Problem-Solving Team Effectiveness Scale (Author, 2020) is a relatively new measure completed by PST members to assess knowledge of intervention technology. This study examined the Problem-Solving Team Effectiveness Scale—Revised (PSTES-R) with an American sample of 369 PST members. Factor and parallel analyses identified four factors: Acceptability and Feasibility, Data-Based Decision Making, Services to Minority Students, and Knowledge of Interventions/ Integrity. Results indicated the PSTES-R possessed adequate internal consistency as well as validity through subtest intercorrelations and known groups, where the PSTES-R consistently differentiated PSTs implementing MTSS and RTI for three or more years from those at earlier stages of implementation. We discuss application of the PSTES-R for professional development with PSTs and the implications for the use of intervention technology, clinical uses of the PSTES-R, and directions for its future research.</p>
<p>The Journal of Educational and Psychological Consultation has an impact factor of 1.603, with a 5-year impact factor of 2.019. The Scopus Cite Score is 2.6. The <em>Journal of Educational and Psychological Consultation (JEPC)</em> provides a forum for improving the scientific understanding of consultation and for describing practical strategies to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of consultation services. JEPC publishes articles and special issues that describe formal research, evaluate practice, examine the program implementation process, systematically review relevant literature, investigate systems change, and carefully document the translation of theory into practice.</p>",Kara Long (Role:Author); Mike Bahr (Role:Author); Joe Nagel (Role:Author); Erin Michelle McClure (Role:Author),,,Blind Peer Reviewed,National,,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Co-author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

To support growth and identity development, students with IDD should have access to all aspects of college life (e.g., activities, relationships, opportunities). Furthermore, students with IDD should have the freedom to take emotional, physical, and intellectual risks relative to those of their peers without disabilities. This leading-edge article is written by practitioners and researchers with and without disabilities associated with the University of Missouri St. Louis IPSE program, Succeed. To center the voices of persons with disabilities, any direct quotations are in italics. In this article, we advocate for increased dignity of risk in IPSE, present a model to assess and make programmatic decisions regarding dignity of risk in IPSE, and highlight five philosophical values that guide our work toward ""messy inclusion.""

Lindsay,Athamanah,Understanding friendships and promoting friendship development through peer mentoring for individuals with and without intellectual and developmental disabilities,International Review of Research in Developmental Disabilities,7/31/2019,2019.0,57,Jan-48,,,Completed/Published,10.1016/bs.irrdd.2019.06.009,,,,Fall,2019,"Abstract: Friendships for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs) provide enhanced community participation and improved quality of life. However, friendships between individuals with and without IDD continue to be scarce with limited opportunities for interaction. In this chapter, we discuss friendship development for individuals with IDD including friendship definitions, characteristics, quality, reciprocity, and satisfaction as well as interpersonal and societal barriers to friendships between individuals with and without IDD. Next, we describe how peer mentoring programs across ages, disability, and settings promote social interactions between individuals with and without IDD and provide opportunities to develop life-long friendships. Then, we propose merging two theories, the Self-Determination Theory (Ryan & Deci, 2000) and the Ecological Systems Theory (Bronfenbrenner, 1976), to use as a guide in creating peer mentoring programs that will support and build the intrinsic motivation and self-determination of individuals without IDD to have the confidence to engage with individuals with IDD. These theories also guide examination of the impact of peer mentoring programs on participants, communities, and society. Finally, we end this chapter with three critical areas for research in friendship development and peer mentoring programs to improve friendship outcomes for individuals with IDD.

In this study, we used a phenomenological research design to explore the impact of a college campus-based peer mentoring program on the experiences and perceptions of participating college peer mentors (N = 13) towards high school students with IDD who were enrolled in a school-to-work transition program housed on campus. Using thematic analysis across four different data sources, we identified three main themes that peer mentors discussed based on their experiences in the program: (a) mentors’ personal development: constructing meaning of self; (b) mentee growth: perceived work and social impact; and (c) campus community benefits: normalizing disability. Peer mentors reported their own attitudes toward individuals with IDD were changed based on participating in the peer mentoring program and they observed improvements in their mentees’ personal and work-related social relationships. We discuss how these outcomes have impacted the peer mentors’ attitudes, career choices, and lives in general. We also provide implications for future research and practice regarding development and implementation of peer mentoring programs in the community.

One intervention that may improve vocational skills and social interactions for
individuals with ASD in the work place is peer-mediated interventions. Peer-mediated interventions (PMI) have consistently documented improvements in academic and social skills for students with ASD in both school-based
and community settings. However, PMI have not been implemented in work-based learning (WBL) settings for transition-aged students with ASD and their general education peers. A multiple baseline across participants’ design evaluated the impact of a PMI on three transition-age youth with ASD in a WBL setting in high school. Results demonstrated an increase in independent engagement in vocational skills and social interactions for all three students with ASD. Furthermore, improvements were observed in the quality of social interactions between the students with ASD and their general education peers across all dyads. Implications for practice, future research, and limitations are discussed.

Lindsay,Athamanah,Applying the self-determination theory to develop a school-to-work peer mentoring programme to promote social inclusion,Journal of Applied Research in Intellectual Disabilities,3/1/2020,2020.0,33,296-309,2,,Completed/Published,10.1111/jar.12673,,,,Spring,2020,"Abstract: Social inclusion of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) is related to positive mental health and social outcomes; yet, individuals with IDD experience societal barriers that limit opportunities for community participation. Providing opportunities for interactions between individuals with and without IDD through peer mentoring may diminish barriers and improve community inclusion. Guided by the self‐determination theory, the current report describes the development of a peer mentoring programme to promote the natural process of building intrinsic motivation and personal growth through opportunities for individuals without disabilities to socialize with individuals with IDD on a large university campus and throughout the surrounding community. The theoretical framework that informed the development of the peer mentoring programme is described, as well as the participants, the setting in which the programme is situated, the structure of the programme, the initial impacts and improvement of the programme over time, including approaches to sustainability, and implications for future research and practice.

Lindsay,Athamanah,Perspectives of Adults without Disabilities on their Friendships with Individuals with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities,Journal of Intellectual Disabilities,,2021.0,,,,,Completed/Published,,,,,Summer,2022,"Abstract: Friendships contribute to positive social outcomes such as the promotion of prosocial behaviors and social well-being and can lead to an overall healthy quality of life. Despite the importance of friendships, little is known about how individuals without disabilities develop and maintain friendships with individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). Using a phenomenological research design, the current study explored the lived experiences of 17 adults without disabilities who discussed the development and maintenance of their friendship with an individual with IDD. Three main themes emerged including 1) factors that facilitated friendship development; 2) factors that contributed to maintenance of the friendship; and 3) impacts of the friendship for both individuals with and without IDD. Implications of the results are discussed as well as future directions for research and policy.

Unfortunately, students with ID often experience limited opportunities to learn and hone these skills while in school. One way to build job and social skills are through a peer-mediated intervention (PMI) in a work-based learning experience (WBLE). A multiple-baseline design across participant dyads with generalization probes was used to investigate the effects of implementing a PMI on job and social skills for students with ID in a WBLE. Results showed that participants demonstrated improvements in job task independence and social interactions. Furthermore, social interaction quality improved after implementing the PMI for most dyads. Limitations and implications for future research are discussed.

The voices of students with significant intellectual and developmental disabilities (SIDD) have historically been sparse in transition
research. Grappling with validity and methodological concerns, researcher most often turn to students with milder disabilities, teachers, parents, and other stakeholders for input about transition services. The purpose of this literature review was to highlight articles published about transition topics that included the perspectives of students with SIDD. This review emphasized research questions, topics, methodologies, demographics, tools, and trends in these studies. Between 1990 and 2015, 11 studies were published that sought input from students with SIDD as stated in the purpose or research questions of the articles in the top 22 special education journals. Specifically, the authors identified strategies used by researchers to facilitate the inclusion of the perspectives of students with SIDD. By acknowledging challenges and
presenting examples of solutions to understanding the various points of view represented by this population of students, this review aimed to empower more researchers to design studies to seek their input.

However, limited research has examined effective practices to initiate a wide range of school, family, and community partnerships. Such knowledge could be especially pivotal to the preparation of special educators for the role of transition specialists. Also, it could be useful for providing important connections among school-based personnel, parents, and community members to link transition goals and transition education. In this study, we examined the experiences of 23 special educators who were enrolled in university graduate studies to become transition specialists. Each led two community conversation events (N = 46 events) in their local school districts. Our examination of the processes they learned to use and the content attendees discussed suggests the conversations were successful in providing these special educators with the capacity to lead collaborations between schools and communities aimed at improving transition education. Recommendations for sustaining collaborations as part of their leadership roles as transition specialists are provided.

While attributes of health literate organizations have been proposed, approaches for strengthening them in healthcare systems with limited resources have not been fully detailed. Methods We conducted key informant interviews with individuals from 11 low resourced health care organizations serving uninsured, underinsured, and government-insured patients across Missouri. The qualitative inquiry explored concepts of impetus to transform, leadership commitment, engaging staff, alignment to organization wide goals, and integration of health literacy with current practices. Findings Several health care organizations reported carrying out health literacy related activities including implementing patient portals, selecting easy to read patient materials, offering community education and outreach programs, and improving discharge and medication distribution processes. The need for change presented itself through data or anecdotal staff experience. For any change to be undertaken, administrators and medical directors had to be supportive; most often a champion facilitated these changes in the organization. Staff and providers were often resistant to change and worried they would be saddled with additional work. Lack of time and funding were the most common barriers reported for integration and sustainability. To overcome these barriers, managers supported changes by working one on one with staff, seeking external funding, utilizing existing resources, planning for stepwise implementation, including members from all staff levels and clear communication. Conclusion Even though barriers exist, resource scarce clinical settings can successfully plan, implement, and sustain organizational changes to support health literacy.",Keri Jupka; Ricardo Wray; Kanak Gautam; Prajakta Adsul; Nancy Weaver; Kristin Wilson,,,,,,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

The Making Change Happen Leadership Academy (MCHLA) was an unanticipated community-driven effort that grew out of SLHS and continues today. The primary goal of the MCHLA is to empower women to gain mastery over their lives and use their power to improve birth outcomes in their communities. Methods Qualitative interviews were conducted with MCHLA participants to determine the impact of participation in the MCHLA on their leadership skills and attitudes. Results Participants reported positive attitudes about themselves including increased confidence and improved parenting skills. Through active participation in project work, they noted increased professional and advocacy skills and recognition of the importance of their voice. As leaders, they recognized the importance of giving and receiving emotional, tangible, and information social support. The small sample prevents us from confidently reporting that findings directly relate to the MCHLA. Discussion Leaders exist in all communities. Public health practitioners may help enhance and develop leaders with tangible support. We need to encourage more MCHLA type programs while systematically evaluating their impact on empowerment in underserved women.",Kate Kasper; Keri Jupka; Lora Gulley; Darcell P Scharff; Ellen Barnidge,,,,,,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Children's hospitals are well positioned to promote these behaviors with evidence-based programming; however, barriers exist to adopting such programs. The purpose of this study was to describe organizational and administrative factors related to the adoption of an efficacious injury prevention (IP) program by children's hospitals in the USA. IP specialists at 232 U.S. children's hospitals were invited to complete a baseline survey, and then offered Safe N' Sound (SNS), an efficacious computer IP program targeting parents of young children. Following this promotion period, specialists were surveyed again to assess their level of SNS adoption. Organizational and administrative factors associated with SNS adoption were identified using conditional random forest models (n = 93). Random forests identified a set of six predictors with potential utility for classifying hospitals as having SNS adoption activity or not; the final pruned classification tree indicated that four of these were best able to differentiate hospitals with and without adoption activity-having a medical director, having other hospital units that provided IP programming, the number of requests the IP unit received within the past year, and the belief of administrative leaders in their responsibility to develop programming all influence decisions.

We translated SNS for implementation in a home visitation organization in order to increase its capacity to effectively address injury prevention and decrease the burden of injury experienced by high-need families. The aim of this study was to identify behavioral and organizational barriers and facilitators to translating and implementing SNS in a home visitation setting. Nurse home visitors (NHVs) participated in semistructured interviews that examined perceptions of program implementation, intervention characteristics, individual characteristics of NHVs, and recommendations for improving implementation. The utility of the program for promoting injury prevention systematically and its alignment with the organization's mission were facilitators of successful implementation. Barriers included NHVs' concerns about overburdening clients and missed educational opportunities related to injury risks not addressed by the program and delayed delivery of educational reports. Findings illustrate the dynamic interactions of intervention characteristics with organizational and individual factors and suggest that customizing implementation to organizational capacity and specific needs may better support successful program implementation in home visitation settings.",Nancy L Weaver; Shannon E Nicks; Ron Tompkins; Maia Elkana; Keri A Jupka; Angela Recktenwald,,,,,,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Although stress has been implicated in structuring the likelihood that individuals will engage in various prenatal health behavior patterns, no studies to date have examined life stress exposure occurring across the entire lifespan, and few have investigated how different types of stressors are comparatively associated with these outcomes. To address these issues, we interviewed 164 women at one of two large Midwestern, urban hospitals after delivering their first infant. We used the Stress and Adversity Inventory (STRAIN) to assess women's lifetime stress exposure severity and ordinary least squares regression models to examine associations between participants' life stress exposure and prenatal health behaviors. As hypothesized, greater lifetime stress exposure was associated with engaging in more negative prenatal health behaviors and fewer positive prenatal health behaviors while controlling for relevant sociodemographic factors and current perceived stress levels. These effects were stronger for negative versus positive health behaviors, and they differed substantially as a function of stressor type, exposure timing, and primary life domain. Stressors occurring over the life course thus have negative consequences for prenatal health behaviors, but these effects are not uniform across different types of life stress exposure.",George M Slavich; Farrah Jacquez; Jennifer Malat; Grant S Shields; Elaina Johns-Wolfe; Teresa Smith,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,Local,Research Board,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Co-author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Robert,Cote,Ethical Perspective: Ethics in The Pharmaceutical Industry: Vioxx Recall,"Journal of Leadership, Accountability and Ethics",2021,2021.0,18,,1,,Completed/Published,,,,,Fall,2020,"The context of this paper examines the industry pressures, that led to the Vioxx Recall in 2004. Current information on the pharmaceutical industry, Federal Legislation and FDA has been updated to provide an ethical perspective comparing the past and present landscape of the industry.  During the early 2000’s, the pharmaceutical industry is going through difficult times due to the external pressures from society. Some of the factors that have created industry pressures are (1) high cost of pharmaceuticals, (2) medications aren’t regulated close enough ensuring they are safe and effective, and (3) consumers lack confidence in pharmaceutical companies, Congress, and governmental agencies. As a result, Congress, pharmaceutical companies, and governmental agencies need to work together as a team to rebuild the confidence of consumers by implementing ethical processes that will drive the pharmaceutical industry in the right direction. By developing, implementing, and evaluation processes to overcome these factors, the pharmaceutical industry can ensure they are doing the right ethical measures to meet the needs of society.

Robert,Cote,Motivating Multigenerational Employees: Is there a difference?  ,"Journal of Leadership, Accountability and Ethics",6/10/2019,2019.0,16,15-29,2,,Completed/Published,,,,1913-8059,Summer,2019,"Today, organizations are faced with a diverse multi-generational workforce that may require different strategies for motivating employees to be engaged in their job and increase job satisfaction. These challenges may be the result of several factors, including trust with management, lack of job recognition, opportunities based on skills, positive relationships, and lack of compensation for their efforts. By evaluating motivational theories, employee’s needs, and behaviors, organizations can develop and implement programs tailored specifically to increase motivation and drive performance. Motivational theories were developed in the 1940’s, 1950’s, and 1960’s and the concepts and principles were applicable to Baby Boomers and previous generations, i.e., Traditionalists or Silent Generation born prior to 1945. The premise of this paper is to further explore the application of motivational theories in all generations. This paper will provide a variety of strategies developed and implemented to motivate employees based on their individual differences. The strategies will take into consideration key factors, including intrinsic (internal) rewards, extrinsic (external) rewards, individual needs, behaviors, personal factors, and organizational factors. Can the findings conclude whether motivation needs are the same or different for the multigenerational workforce?  Further research may be needed to explore the application of motivational theories and motivation programs with generation’s post 1960’s.",Robert Cote (Role:Author),,,Blind Peer Reviewed,National,Honorarium ,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Lead / Corresponding author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Based on current research, dark side leaders can possess destructive traits that result in toxic and negative consequences with employee morale, productivity, and organizational cultures. These traits can range from low risk to high risk and are manageable. Another aspect of this research is to explore inherent genes that may trigger personality disorders based on internal and external pressures within organizations. Personality disorder traits are extreme risk and result in dysfunctional maladaptive behaviors that may not be resolved. Based on the range of dark traits, proposed approaches will provide options for dark side leaders with unethical behaviors, including best practices, recommendations, therapy, and medications.

Shakiba,Enayati,Reliable Supply Network Design with Customer Preferences,European Journal of Operational Research,,2022.0,,,,,Submitted,,,,,Spring,2022,"The classical facility location models assume that a central planner makes both the location and allocation decisions. This is the case, for example, when a firm ships products to its customers from different distribution centers. However, if the customers travel to the facilities to obtain service, they would go to the facility of their choice. That is, once the facilities are open, customers may not comply with the minimum cost allocation of the central planner any more. Furthermore, different customer types may have different preferences over the set of available facilities based on socioeconomic and demographic factors.

We introduce the reliable facility location problem with customer preferences. The proposed model opens facilities and allocates customers to facilities with respect to their preferences. The objective of the model is to minimize the total cost of opening facilities plus the expected service cost. Less preferred facilities serve as a backup if more preferred facilities fail. The proposed model bridges the gap between the location models that consider the preferences of customers  and the ones that consider the reliability of facilities.
We study structural properties of our model formulation and derive valid inequalities to tighten its LP relaxation. 
 We propose two solution algorithms: Benders decomposition and a neighborhood search-based branch-and-cut algorithm. We test the computational performance of these algorithms in our numerical experiments. We also present a sensitivity analysis on facility failure probabilities and disutility cost.

Shakiba,Enayati,Optimal Dynamic Selection of Interventions to Curb Prescription Opioid Pill Diversion,Decision Analysis,,2022.0,,,,,Submitted,,,,,Spring,2022,"The diversion of opioid pills from those with a prescription to individuals without one exacerbates the current opioid crisis by raising the misuse risk, the addiction prevalence, and thus overdose deaths. Many interventions are proposed in practice to address the diversion problem. Some prevent new addiction cases with longer-term effects and some mitigate the harms with shorter-term effects. We employ a  compartmental model for the opioid pill diversion problem and apply the Markov Decision Process to find the optimal state-dependent selection of interventions. The proposed model may serve as a decision-aid tool that allows for an adaptive investment on interventions given the current state of the pill diversion epidemic to minimize both the negative health outcomes of the epidemic and the implementation costs of interventions. We study the impact of quantities chosen for the cost parameters and the effect size of interventions on the structure of the optimal selection of interventions. We show the flexibility of our proposed tool for recommending near-optimal selection of interventions, if preferred  in practice.  Our model confirms that implementing preventive interventions in the early stages of the epidemic is optimal. At later stages, with more infected people, it is optimal to implement mitigating interventions to reduce the number of fatal overdoses. We also show that starting early with preventive interventions is less costly than mitigating the epidemic when a larger proportion become addicted. Finally, we observe that it is cost-effective to do nothing when the susceptible proportion in the population or the effect size of interventions are small.",Sina Ansari (Role:Author); Shakiba Enayati (Role:Author); Julie M.

Sapna,Varkey,Moving publicness forward: Merging Moulton and Merritt’s frameworks to examine managed care organizations,Perspectives on Public Management and Governance,,2021.0,,,,,In Press,,,,,Spring,2022,"Publicness work focuses on the unique characteristics that make an organization more, or less, public, and dates back to the late seventies. Despite the range of publicness research that exists, the characteristics explored remain largely unchanged. However, merging Merritt’s (2019) primary influences that make an organization public and Moulton’s (2009) realized publicness frameworks provides the structure necessary to explore a broader conceptualization of organizational publicness. This study pushes theory forward by examining aspects of publicness beyond political authority-specific characteristics and expanding publicness theory to examine behavioral health managed care organizations (MCOs). Collective case study results show substantial variation among, and within, MCOs, even among a set of public organizations that are assumed to be homogenous and subject to substantial oversight. Findings highlight the value in merging these frameworks to explore a broader conceptualization of publicness.

The Institute for Nonprofits at North Carolina State University identified five nonprofit leadership challenges, through a combination of practitioner experience and academic research, that could serve as a typology. The challenges identified are earning the public trust; aligning mission, methods, and resources; capitalizing on issues associated with diversity; balancing individual interests and the common good; and moving beyond charity to systemic change. This research revisits the academic literature to assess whether these challenges encompass the research agenda of nonprofit and voluntary action academic studies. Using qualitative content analysis, we examined abstracts from three major nonprofit journals from 2005-2017. Results indicate that the five leadership challenges were present in the abstracts of all three journals. Chi-squared analysis showed statistically significant differences in the presence of leadership challenges based on journal, location of the study, and unit of analysis. Validating this typology strengthens the Institute’s efforts and inform research and practice throughout the field.",Jayce Sudweeks (Role:Author); Richard M.

Its development was a trial and error effort driven primarily from clinical experience. Dialectical behavior therapy is a modular and hierarchical treatment consisting of a combination of individual psychotherapy, group skills, training, telephone coaching, and a therapist consultation team. The inherent modularity and hierarchical structure of DBT has allowed for relative ease in adapting and applying the treatment to other populations and settings. New skills have been developed and/or modified due to clinical need and/or advancement in research such as treatment outcomes or mechanisms. There has been an effort to implement DBT skills as a standalone treatment. More research is needed to assess how DBT skills work and for whom.

Sexual functioning is associated with relationship distress and has recently been identified as a predictor of suicidal ideation with female military personnel; however, no studies have examined this association among a treatment-seeking sample of male and female veterans and their partners. Couples (N = 138) completed baseline assessments of sexual functioning, relationship functioning, suicidal ideation, and mental health prior to evaluation for engagement in a couples-based PTSD treatment study. Analyses revealed that decreased sexual pleasure and decreased frequency of sexual intercourse were associated with more recent suicidal ideation for male veterans, whereas increased sexual frequency was marginally associated with increased suicidal ideation for female veterans, controlling for PTSD and depression symptoms, relationship satisfaction, and medications. These findings stress the importance of assessing sexual functioning as a risk factor for suicide and taking into consideration the possibility that sexual functioning may be protective or predictive of suicidality depending on the person and context.",Derek Thomas; Chandra E Khalifian; Min J Sohn; Kayla Knopp; Chelsey R Wilks; Leslie A Morland; Jennalee Wooldridge,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,Local,Research Board,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Lead / Corresponding author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

The present pilot study evaluated whether and how integrating PTSD treatment into an EBP for BPD would improve functional outcomes. Participants were 26 women with BPD, PTSD, and recent suicidal and/or self-injurious behavior who were randomized to receive one year of Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) or DBT with the DBT Prolonged Exposure (DBT PE) protocol for PTSD. Five domains of functioning were assessed at 4-month intervals during treatment and at 3-months post-treatment. DBT + DBT PE was superior to DBT in improving global social adjustment, health-related quality of life, and achieving good global functioning, but not interpersonal problems or quality of life. Results of time-lagged mixed effects models indicated that, across both treatments, reductions in PTSD severity significantly predicted subsequent improvement in global social adjustment, global functioning, and health-related quality of life, whereas reductions in post-traumatic cognitions significantly predicted later improvement in all functional outcomes except global social adjustment.

The High School Transition Program (HSTP) was designed to build social and academic problem-solving skills and engagement during this period of particular vulnerability for adolescents. Students (N = 2664) at six middle schools in the Pacific Northwest completed a universal emotional health screening during the second half of the 8th grade year, and those with elevated depression scores and low conduct problem scores were invited to participate in the trial. Eligible students (N = 497) were randomized to either the HSTP (N = 241) or control (N = 256) conditions. Depression and anxiety symptoms were measured at five time points over an 18-month period using validated self-report measures. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to assess prevention effects and moderators such as baseline symptoms, race, and sex. Results suggested that students randomized to the HSTP group had accelerated rate of reduction in depressive symptoms over time (d = .23) relative to the control group. Students randomized to the HSTP group also had significantly faster rates of change of anxiety scores (d = 0.25). Baseline anxiety severity, race, and sex did not differentially impact the trajectories of symptom outcomes between conditions.

Studies have shown that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depression (MDD), and traumatic brain injury (TBI) increase risk of suicidal behavior in veterans. Limited research has examined anger and social support as factors linked to suicidal ideation, which if demonstrated could lead to new, effective strategies for suicide risk assessment and prevention. Iraq/Afghanistan era veterans (N = 2467) were evaluated in the ongoing Veterans Affairs Mid-Atlantic Mental Illness Research, Education and Clinical Center (MIRECC) multi-site Study of Post-Deployment Mental Health on demographic and psychological variables. Analyses revealed that suicidal ideation in veterans was positively associated with anger and negatively associated with social support. These results remained significant in multivariate logistic regression models controlling for relevant variables including PTSD, MDD, and TBI. Examining interrelationships among these variables, the analyses revealed that the association between PTSD and suicidal ideation was no longer statistically significant once anger was entered in the regression models. Further, it was found that TBI was associated with suicidal ideation in veterans with MDD but not in veterans without MDD. These findings provide preliminary evidence that suicide risk assessment in military veterans should include clinical consideration of the roles of anger and social support in addition to PTSD, MDD, and TBI. Further, the results suggest that suicide prevention may benefit from anger management interventions as well as interventions aimed at bolstering social and family support as treatment adjuncts to lower suicide risk in veterans.",Kirsten H Dillon; Leslie A Morland; Chelsey R Wilks; M A Mackintosh; Shannon M Blakey; H R Wagner; VA Mid-Atlantic MIRECC Workgroup ; Eric B Elbogen,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,National,None,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Lead / Corresponding author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

This cycle of association has prompted a recommendation for psychological treatment of chronic pain to target mechanisms for emotion regulation. The current trial addressed this need by investigating a new internet-delivered treatment incorporating emotional skills training from dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT). Using a single-case experimental design that is suited to heterogeneous populations and can demonstrate efficacy with a small sample, three participants with chronic pain were recruited. Participants received four weeks of online DBT skills training (iDBT-Pain intervention) which incorporated one-on-one sessions over Zoom and a web app. Results revealed compelling evidence for the intervention on the primary outcome of emotion dysregulation and were promising for the secondary outcome of pain intensity. Improvement was also identified on pre-and post-measures of depression, coping behaviors, sleep problems, wellbeing, and harm avoidance, indicating that the intervention may positively influence other factors related to chronic pain. Overall, the trial provides preliminary efficacy for the intervention to improve chronic pain. However, we recommend further investigation of the iDBT-Pain intervention, either in single case trials, which when conducted with scientific rigor may be aggregated to derive nomothetic conclusions, or in a group-comparison trial to compare with usual modes of treatment. PERSPECTIVE: This trial advances understanding of emotion-focused treatment for chronic pain and provides evidence for a viable new technological treatment. Importantly, as an internet-delivered approach, the iDBT-Pain intervention is accessible to those with restricted mobility and remote communities where there are often limited psychological services for people with chronic pain.",Jina Suh; Mary Czerwinski; Nancy E Briggs; Yann Quidé; Jessica Schroeder; Negin Hesam-Shariati; James McAuley; Sylvia M Gustin; Chelsey R Wilks; Nell Norman-Nott,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,International,,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Co-author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Much of the research on this transition has been conducted with English-speaking mental health providers, leaving a gap in understanding related to how this shift has impacted Spanish-speaking treatment providers.  Fifty non-U.S. Spanish-speaking therapists completed a survey related to their use of telecommunication modalities; client population characteristics; professional, ethical, and legal/regulatory issues; and telehealth training and practice. Participants completed the survey at one time point and retrospectively described their use of telehealth both pre-pandemic and during the pandemic.  Most of the 50 Spanish-speaking therapists surveyed reported using telepsychology 58% before COVID-19 versus 84% during the COVID-19 pandemic (χ = 5.76,  < 0.05). Compared with pre-pandemic, the number of hours therapists spent using telepsychology per week increased significantly for early adopter therapists (those who began using telehealth before the pandemic began) ( = -3.18,  = 0.001) and also for late adopter therapists who only began using telehealth during the pandemic ( = -3.74,  < 0.001). Many therapists reported equity issues. Most participants also reported ethical and regulatory concerns regarding security/confidentiality or Health Insurance Porability and Accountability Act.  The rapid adoption of technology to deliver therapy during COVID-19 has spurred growing pains for Spanish-speaking therapists and their underserved clients, and more research is needed to better understand and improve the therapists' adoption of these technologies with diverse patient populations.",Bruno De Sousa; Hunter G Hoffman; Mariana Sampaio; Maria V Navarro Haro; Chelsey Wilks; Azucena Garcia-Palacios,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,International,,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Co-author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Indirect evidence suggests some internalizing and externalizing psychological problems among enlistees onset prior to enlistment. However, the consistency and strength of the associations between pre-enlistment psychological problems and enlistment over time is unknown. We address this uncertainty by examining whether internalizing and externalizing problems in high school predicted subsequent military enlistment using a large cohort-sequential panel study. : The Monitoring the Future study administered baseline surveys from 1989-2014 and biennial follow-up surveys two and four years later to national samples of high-school seniors (N = 20,823). Validated self-report scales assessed internalizing (depression, low self-esteem) and externalizing (risk-taking, school misbehavior, conduct disorder, interpersonal violence, alcohol, and drug use) problems in each survey. Follow-up surveys assessed military enlistment. Logistic regression models were used to estimate associations of problems scales with subsequent enlistment. : School misbehavior in 12 grade, and risk-taking in 12 grade and two years after graduation were associated with significantly elevated odds of enlistment at follow-up. Although modest, these associations were linear and invariant across respondent sex and baseline survey year. : School misbehavior and risk-taking predicted subsequent enlistment and there was no evidence of historical changes in these associations over the course of 25 years; these pre-enlistment psychological problems do not fully explain the high rates of psychological disorders among enlisted military personnel. Further research is needed to determine whether these predictors are associated with negative outcomes during or after military service.",Thomas E Joiner; Ronald C Kessler; Robert J Ursano; Matthew K Nock; Peter M Gutierrez; Andrew King; Samantha L Bernecker; Ke L Zuromski; Chelsey R Wilks; Carol Chu,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,National,None,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Co-author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

This case study illustrates the implementation of a PE protocol into standard DBT treatment, specifically focusing on the management of self-harm and severe dissociation for a client with co-occurring PTSD and BPD. The client entered into treatment with severe and persistent dissociation and a recent history of self-harm, and the case includes consideration of two separate pauses in PTSD treatment related to elevated dissociation and self-harm behaviors. The client successfully completed the DBT PE protocol and results indicate significant improvements in PTSD symptoms as well as outcomes related to self-harm and dissociation.

However, most current tools fail to meet evidence-based principles. In this paper, we describe data-driven design implications for translating evidence-based interventions into mobile apps. To develop these design implications, we analyzed data from a month-long field study of an app designed to support dialectical behavioral therapy, a psychotherapy that aims to teach concrete coping skills to help people better manage their mental health. We investigated whether particular skills are more or less effective in reducing distress or emotional intensity. We also characterized how an individual's disorders, characteristics, and preferences may correlate with skill effectiveness, as well as how skill-level improvements correlate with study-wide changes in depressive symptoms. We then developed a model to predict skill effectiveness. Based on our findings, we present design implications that emphasize the importance of considering different environmental, emotional, and personal contexts. Finally, we discuss promising future opportunities for mobile apps to better support evidence-based psychotherapies, including using machine learning algorithms to develop personalized and context-aware skill recommendations.",Jina Suh; Chelsey Wilks; Jessica Schroeder; Mary Czerwinski; Se A Munson; James Fogarty; Tim Althoff,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,National,Commissioned,Presentation paper,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Co-author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Understanding what factors are associated with functional impairment will enable treatment providers to move those diagnosed with BPD beyond symptomatic recovery and toward a life worth living. This paper investigated the trajectories and predictors of functional outcomes for suicidal women with BPD (N = 99) during a treatment outcome study of Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT). Results revealed that participants had statistical and clinical improvements in functioning. Individuals with high emotion dysregulation displayed poorer psychosocial functioning at the subsequent assessment period and slower rates of change, which was also seen in reverse for one psychosocial functioning variable. Skills use was not related to individual trajectories in functioning. This study highlights the relationship of emotion dysregulation to functioning within a sample of suicidal women with BPD as well as the importance researching multiple domains in functioning.

Chelsey,Wilks,The importance of physical and mental health in explaining health-related academic role impairment among college students,Journal of psychiatric research,1/29/2020,2020.0,123,54-61,,,Completed/Published,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.01.009,32036074,PMC7047531,1879-1379,Fall,2020,"Research consistently documents high rates of mental health problems among college students and strong associations of these problems with academic role impairment. Less is known, though, about prevalence and effects of physical health problems in relation to mental health problems. The current report investigates this by examining associations of summary physical and mental health scores from the widely-used Short-Form 12 (SF-12) Health Survey with self-reported academic role functioning in a self-report survey of 3,855 first-year students from five universities in the northeastern United States (US; mean age 18.5; 53.0% female). The mean SF-12 physical component summary (PCS) score (55.1) was half a standard deviation above the benchmark US adult population mean. The mean SF-12 mental component summary (MCS) score (38.2) was more than a full standard deviation below the US adult population mean. Two-thirds of students (67.1%) reported at least mild and 10.5% severe health-related academic role impairment on a modified version of the Sheehan Disability Scale. Both PCS and MCS scores were significantly and inversely related to these impairment scores, but with nonlinearities and interactions and much stronger associations involving MCS than PCS. Simulation suggests that an intervention that improved the mental health of all students with scores below the MCS median to be at the median would result in a 61.3% reduction in the proportion of students who experienced severe health-related academic role impairment. Although low-cost scalable interventions exist to address student mental health problems, pragmatic trials are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions in reducing academic role impairment.",David D D Ebert; Cl A Mellins; Ronald C Kessler; Jordi Alonso; Ekaterina Sadikova; Corina Benjet; Ronny Bruffaerts; Jennifer G Green; Philippe Mortier; Randy P Auerbach; N A Sampson; Chelsey R Wilks; Pim Cuijpers,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,,Research Board,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Lead / Corresponding author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

I played a significant role in determining inclusion criteria, developing the code book, coding articles, and editing the manuscript. Abstract: To better understand the existing research for teaching workplace social skills to individuals with severe disabilities, we conducted a systematic review of the literature across five databases between the years 1975 and 2020. This review examined study characteristics, intervention efficacy, and methodological soundness. We identified a total of 26 studies across 78 participants with severe disabilities. There were 18 intervention components used and a total of five studies found to have strong positive effects on the dependent variables. Only one study was of methodological soundness. Our findings suggest there is limited evidence to support effective interventions for teaching workplace social skills to individuals with severe disabilities.

To support growth and identity development, students with IDD should have access to all aspects of college life (e.g., activities, relationships, opportunities). Furthermore, students with IDD should have the freedom to take emotional, physical, and intellectual risks relative to those of their peers without disabilities. This leading-edge article is written by practitioners and researchers with and without disabilities associated with the University of Missouri St. Louis IPSE program, Succeed. To center the voices of persons with disabilities, any direct quotations are in italics. In this article, we advocate for increased dignity of risk in IPSE, present a model to assess and make programmatic decisions regarding dignity of risk in IPSE, and highlight five philosophical values that guide our work toward ""messy inclusion.""

In 2014, the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) established a policy focus on CIE as the goal of vocational services for youth and individuals with disabilities. In addition, WIOA created provision for Pre–Employment Transition Services (Pre-ETS) to ensure that state vocational rehabilitation (VR) agencies focused sufficient resources toward transition-age youth. This study examined a sample of WIOA state implementation plans in depth using content analysis to identify how state VR agencies prioritized the provision of Pre-ETS services to youth with disabilities. Analysis of state plans resulted in three emergent themes: (a) instructional priorities, (b) instructional contexts, and (c) networks of stakeholders. We discuss the implications of these themes for future research, policy, and practice related to the employment of individuals with disabilities.

An online questionnaire was emailed to high school special education teachers in four states who had a state issued teaching license in intellectual disability. A total of 266 teachers completed the questionnaire. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to answer the research questions. Students participated in a variety of work-based learning experiences, with more students participating in school experiences than community experiences. The majority of work experiences were in one of three career clusters: (a) hospitality and tourism, (b) business, management, and administration, or (c) general work skills. Amount of time spent in work experiences varied greatly, with students spending more time in school experiences than community experiences. Student support needs and grade level were related to participation in community experiences. Grade level was also related to the amount of time students spent in school and community experiences.

Analysing state archival data on prison highway and forestry camps between 1915 and 2000, we frame the persistence of these practices as evidence of a penal labour palimpsest. We demonstrate how the agency and interpretive innovation of penal administrators – as the architects and interpreters of this palimpsest – served as a stabilising mechanism akin to, but distinct from, existing theories of path dependence. Zooming out from the intricacies of the historical record, we position this case as revealing some of the limits of strict theories of path dependence and, instead, as offering a more dynamic understanding of the complex, intersecting and malleable ways in which history matters.</span>",Philip Goodman (Role:Author); Kaitlyn Rose Quinn (Role:Author),,,Blind Peer Reviewed,,,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Co-author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Kaitlyn,Quinn,"""Good Intentions Pave Many Roads. Not All of Them Lead to Hell"": Understanding Volunteers' Work with Criminalized Women",Social Problems,,2023.0,,,,,Submitted,,,,,Summer,2023,"<p>The idea of relationships between volunteers and criminalized individuals within non-profit organizations evokes richly positive imagery of benevolence, inclusion, and social bridging. Yet, these assumptions are under-theorized and largely unsubstantiated. We know little about how volunteers form relationships with criminalized individuals outside of research highlighting the value of shared experiences of incarceration for greater understanding, connection, and trust within peer-led initiatives. This is problematic given that many volunteers neither have lived experience of incarceration nor experience navigating the kinds of structural barriers and social exclusions that criminalized individuals regularly face. However, volunteers’ organizational roles frequently presume that they can form meaningful connections with, and offer appropriate support to, individuals who are navigating a very different set of social circumstances. This ethnography of women-centered non-profit organizations in Canada examines the possibilities of relationship formation across these differences, highlighting their promises as well as their risks. Specifically, this research explores: (i) how volunteers attempt to form relationships with criminalized women, (ii) the visions of helping that encourage volunteers to relate to criminalized women in distinct ways, (iii) the organizational contexts in which these differing approaches are embedded, and (iv) the consequences of these differences for criminalized women.</p>",Kaitlyn Rose Quinn (Role:Author),,,Blind Peer Reviewed,,,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

The result is an increasingly competitive field of social service provision in which organizations must differentiate themselves in the struggle over funding, contracts, symbolic authority, and potential clients. We explore this struggle by examining the distinct roads to reentry constructed at four PVS organizations in Ontario, Canada. Our analysis initiates a dialogue between individual narratives and organizational discourses, contending that the road to reentry is coauthored among organizations and criminalized individuals—albeit on unequal terms. Our findings reveal that there are significant pressures for criminalized individuals to perform narrative labor to align themselves with organizational understandings of reentry. Such pressures include: the denial of services or social assistance payments, threats of being returned to prison for “inadequate” participation in rehabilitation, and risks of not being considered for coveted “professional ex” positions at PVS organizations. In light of these empirical findings, we also offer a conceptual reflection on the challenges criminalized individuals likely face accessing services from multiple organizations with differing roads to reentry, suggesting that navigating these diverse roads not only requires narrative labor, but also narrative dexterity.</span></p>",Philip Goodman (Role:Author); Kaitlyn Rose Quinn (Role:Author),,,Blind Peer Reviewed,,Research Board,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Lead / Corresponding author,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) Insight Grant,,,,English,,Self-reported,

This article investigates women’s experiences exiting prison in Canada to deepen understandings of post-carceral trajectories and their implications. It combines feminist work on transcarceration and Bourdieusian theory with qualitative research undertaken in Canada to propose the </span>(trans)carceral habitus<span> as a theoretical innovation. This research illuminates the continuity of criminalized women’s marginalization before and beyond their imprisonment, the embodied nature of these experiences, and the adaptive dispositions that they have demonstrated and depended on throughout their lives. In doing so, this article extends criminological work on carceral habitus which has rarely considered the experiences of women. Implications for resettlement are discussed by tracing the impact of criminalized women’s (trans)carceral habitus (i.e. distrust, skepticism, vigilance about their environments and relationships) on their willingness to access support and services offered by resettlement organizations.</span>",Kaitlyn Rose Quinn,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,,Research Board,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,,,,English,,Self-reported,

The purpose of the present study was to investigate risk factors for attrition among young children receiving trauma-focused therapy. Study participants were 189 treatment-seeking children aged 3-5 years (M = 4.86 years, SD = 0.71; 54.1% female, 47.7% White) and their nonoffending legal guardian(s). Child and family characteristics, number of traumatic events, and pretreatment posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) were examined in relation to two attrition definitions: (a) clinician-rated dropout and (b) whether the child received an adequate treatment dose (i.e., 12 or more sessions). Although 70.3% of children prematurely terminated therapy per their clinician, a nearly equivalent portion (67.4%) received an adequate treatment dose. Family characteristics were largely not associated with attrition, although residing farther from the clinic was related to clinician-rated treatment dropout, OR = 0.96. As expected, higher levels of externalizing symptoms were associated with clinician-rated dropout and inadequate dose status, ORs = .95 and .96, respectively, whereas lower levels of trauma-related anger were related to clinician-rated treatment completion, OR = 1.03, and lower levels of PTSS and sexual concerns corresponded with an increased likelihood the child received an inadequate treatment dose, ORs = 1.03 and 1.02, respectively. Thus, child and family factors appear to play a small role in predicting attrition; however, higher levels of externalizing problems and lower levels of PTSS may increase the risk for dropout.

The objective of this study was to examine the contributions of trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms in predicting length of time to conception and utilization of infertility testing and treatment. Two hundred and forty-six trauma-exposed females ( = 36.69, SD = 10.82, Range = 19-59; 62.2% white) who had either been pregnant or had tried to become pregnant were included in the study. Participants' level of trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms were examined in relation to length of time to conception and use of infertility testing and treatments. Infertility was present in 16.7% of the sample, 12.4% of participants had seen a doctor regarding infertility and 9.9% of participants had undergone fertility testing or treatments. PTSD was significantly related to longer length of time to conception, use of infertility testing and treatment and number of infertility testing and treatments, after controlling for covariates. Cumulative trauma, defined as number of traumatic exposures, was marginally related to use of infertility testing and treatments, but not to length of time to conception or number of infertility testing and treatments. Neither cumulative trauma nor PTSD was associated with self-reported infertility diagnosis. PTSD, but not trauma exposure, may be a risk factor for reduced fecundity and increased use of infertility treatment and testing among women.

However, very little information is known regarding the relations between trauma exposure, PTSD, and aggression among non-veteran women. Furthermore, research has not examined the associations between trauma exposure, PTSD symptoms, and aggression using the APA DSM-5 PTSD criteria. The primary aim of the current study was to investigate the relationships between trauma exposure, PTSD symptoms, and aggression among women. The secondary aim was to examine the specific PTSD symptom clusters in relation to indices of aggression. A total of 217 civilian, trauma-exposed female undergraduate students participated in the study (M = 24.30, SD = 6.83, 63.2% White). Higher levels of trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms corresponded with anger (B = .47, 95% CI = [0.11-0.83]; B = .11, 95% CI = [0.05-0.16], respectively) and verbal aggression (B = .50, 95% CI = [0.21-0.78]; B = .06, 95% CI = [0.01-0.10], respectively). PTSD symptoms, but not cumulative trauma exposure, was associated with hostility (B = .23, 95% CI = [0.14-0.59]), whereas physical aggression was only related to trauma exposure (B = .69, 95% CI = [0.31-1.06]). Furthermore, there was a significant indirect effect of cumulative trauma through PTSD symptoms on anger and verbal aggression (B = .15, 95% CI = [0.05-0.32]; B = .09, 95% CI = [0.02-0.20], respectively). Trauma-exposed civilian females with higher levels of PTSD symptoms may be at increased risk for several indices of aggressive behavior. Furthermore, PTSD symptoms may better account for some, but not all, aspects of aggression in trauma-exposed women.

Further, few studies have examined multiple forms of trauma such as exposure to community violence and several likely important familial and environmental factors have yet to be investigated in the context of SBPs. The use of a more comprehensive ecological model of child, trauma-related, family, and environmental risk factors may help to further delineate the factors that contribute to the development of SBPs. Objective: The aim of the current study was to build upon previous research by utilizing an ecological model that includes child, trauma-related, caregiver and familial, and environmental factors as potential predictors of SBPs. Participants and Setting: The present study was conducted with 1,112 8-year-old children (51.6% female; 48.9% Black) and their primary caregivers from the Longitudinal Studies in Child Abuse and Neglect (LONGSCAN) study. Results: Several child, caregiver, and familial factors, as well as sexual and physical abuse demonstrated bivariate associations with SBPs. A number of these factors remained significant in a regression model, such as child’s living arrangement, child’s aggressive behaviors and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), sexual and physical abuse, caregiver’s psychological difficulties, and children’s perceptions of family health. Conclusions: The findings highlight the role of select child, trauma-related, caregiver and familial, and environmental factors in the context of SBPs and also demonstrate the need to examine multiple levels of children’s environments when investigating SBPs.

Rachel,Wamser,"Children’s Coping Following Sexual Abuse: The Roles of Abuse Characteristics, Abuse Stress, and Maternal Support",Journal of Child and Family Studies,,2020.0,29,514-525,,,Completed/Published,,,,,Spring,2020,"Objectives: Although the use of coping strategies is recognized as playing a vital role in predicting the development of trauma-related symptoms, little research has identified what factors may contribute to the utilization, and perceived efficacy of, coping strategies following childhood sexual abuse (CSA). Research has not determined whether aspects of the CSA (e.g., duration, severity) and CSA-related factors such as abuse stressors (e.g., coercion, threats), abuse-related events (e.g., familial disruptions, legal system involvement), and maternal emotional support and blame/doubt correspond with children’s coping use and perceived effectiveness. Methods: The current study investigated whether CSA characteristics, abuse stress, and maternal support were related to children’s utilization and perceived efficacy of active/social, internalized, angry, and avoidant coping strategies among 141 sexually abused children aged 7–12 (M= 9.72, SD= 1.50). Results: Children used nearly 7 types of coping strategies (M= 6.71, SD = 1.63). Longer CSA duration was associated with utilization of internalized and avoidant coping, and maternal blame/doubt predicted the use of avoidant coping. Girls utilized angry coping more frequently than boys. CSA characteristics and abuse stress were largely unrelated to children’s perceived coping efficacy. Minority children reported higher levels of perceived efficacy of internalized strategies than white children. Conclusions: CSA duration may be important in understanding children’s utilization of internalized and avoidant coping strategies and maternal blame/doubt may be related to children’s use of avoidant coping. However, CSA characteristics and abuse stress may ultimately have little bearing on sexually abused children’s use and perceived efficacy of coping strategies.

Although non-Criterion A stressors, such as neglect or foster care placement, are related to PTSS, they have not been adequately compared to Criterion A events in relation to indices of parenting. The current study investigated whether Criterion A and non-Criterion A stressors were associated with more negative parenthood beliefs and parental behavior. The study also examined whether trauma exposure and stressful life events, compared to PTSS, best accounted for any observed links to parenting-related beliefs and parental difficulties. Methods: Two hundred and forty-three parents (Mage = 37.59; SD = 8.35; 61.6% female; 54.6% White) were included in the study. Results: Path analyses revealed that non-Criterion A events were tied to more negative parenting-related perceptions of one’s partner and social relationships and lower levels of parental support (range βs = -.20 - .23). Even after controlling for PTSS, exposure to non-Criterion A events remained associated with more negative parenting-specific beliefs regarding one’s partner (β = -.17) and marginally to perceptions of relationships (β = -.13), yet was related to higher levels of parenting satisfaction and involvement (range βs = .18 - .21). Criterion A events were unrelated to parenting perceptions and behavior, irrespective of PTSS. Conclusions: Non-Criterion A exposure may exhibit stronger ties to parenting-related beliefs than exposure to Criterion A events. Stressful life experiences, along with PTSS, may then be important to address to improve parenting outcomes among stress-exposed parents.

Rachel,Wamser,The Gun Behaviors and Beliefs Scale: Development of a New Measure of Gun Beliefs ,Psychology of Violence,,2020.0,,,,,Completed/Published,,,,,Spring,2020,"Objective: Gun violence is a serious public health concern that is currently grossly understudied. Gun attitudes are a potential risk factor for gun violence, yet factors relating to perceptions of guns have not been identified. Further, the existing measures of gun beliefs do not comprehensively assess gun behaviors and gun-related beliefs such as the perceived advantages of gun carrying and socially-related gun perceptions. The purpose of this study was to develop a more complete and psychometrically sound tool to measure gun perceptions, the Gun Behaviors and Beliefs Scale (GBBS). Methods: Four hundred and thirty participants were recruited from a Midwestern University or Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) (Mage = 30.03, SD = 12.06, Range = 18-63; 58.8% female; 73.7% White) to conduct an exploratory factor analysis (EFA). A second sample of 360 participants (Mage = 28.41, SD = 11.92, Range = 18-65; 56.9% female; 65% White) was used for the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Results: The EFA yielded 5 subscales that were largely consistent with expectations: Safety and Control, Emotional Risk, Neighborhood Factors, Gun Presence, and Social Perceptions. The CFA supported the measure’s factor structure. In both samples, the GBBS had good internal consistency (Range αs = .79 - .96) and demonstrated evidence of convergent and divergent validity. Gun beliefs on the GBBS corresponded with reported gun behaviors. Conclusions: The study resulted in the development of a novel self-report measure of both gun behaviors as well as gun beliefs that may be useful in researching gun behavior, aggression, and gun violence.

Prior research has demonstrated that there are gender differences in trauma exposure as well as trauma-related symptoms; however, gender discrepancies have not previously been examined in the context of child survivors of complex trauma. The aim of the present study was to determine whether there are gender differences in both caregiver and child-reported trauma exposure and symptoms among 167 children who have experienced complex trauma (3-18 years, M = 9.90, SD = 3.92; 61.67% female). Male children were somewhat more likely to have been exposed to domestic violence, while female children were more likely to have experienced sexual abuse as well as more likely to have been abused by a caregiver. Gender differences were observed for several of the caregiver-reported symptom domains, with female children exhibiting higher levels of depression, dissociation, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) hyperarousal symptoms, and total PTSD symptoms. Female children also self-reported higher levels of sexual concerns, and marginally more re-experiencing and total PTSD symptoms. Secondary analyses utilizing only children who experienced sexual abuse revealed that gender differences largely remained, again with females manifesting higher levels of symptoms. Thus, following complex trauma, female children may be at higher risk for trauma-related difficulties, which has implications for research and clinical interventions.

Method: Participants included 1281 bereaved youth aged 12–21 years (M=15, SD=1.8; 62.1% female), from the National Child Traumatic Stress Network Core Data Set. Results: Generalized linear mixed‐effects regression models controlling for demographics and other traumas revealed that youth bereaved by multiple deaths had higher posttraumatic stress scores than youth bereaved by a single death (Estimated difference ±SE=3.36 ± 1.11, p=0.003). Youth bereaved by suicide were more likely to report experiencing suicidal thoughts or behaviors (AOR=1.68, p=0.049) and alcohol use (AOR=2.33, p<0.001) than youth bereaved by natural causes. Youth bereaved by homicide were at greater risk for substance use than youth bereaved by natural death (AOR=1.76, p=0.02). Compared to parentally bereaved youth, youth who lost a peer were more likely to use alcohol (AOR=2.32, p=0.02) or other substances (AOR=2.41, p=0.01); in contrast, parentally bereaved youth were more likely to experience depression compared to those who experienced the death of an adult relative or unrelated adult (range of AOR: 0.40 to 0.64, p‐values<0.05). Conclusion: These bereavement‐related contextual factors can serve as early markers of mental and behavioral health problems among bereaved youth.

Rigorously constructed tools for assessing PCBD are lacking, especially for youth. This study evaluated the validity and clinical utility of the PCBD Checklist, a 39-item measure designed to assess PCBD criteria in youth aged 8 to18 years. Test construction procedures involved: (a) reviewing the literature regarding developmental manifestations of proposed criteria, (b) creating a developmentally informed item pool, (c) surveying an expert panel to evaluate the clarity and developmental appropriateness of candidate items, (d) conducting focus groups to evaluate the comprehensibility and acceptability of items, and (e) evaluating psychometric properties in 367 bereaved youth (M = 13.49, 55.0% female). The panel, clinicians, and youth provided favorable content validity and comprehensibility ratings for candidate items. As hypothesized, youth who met full PCBD criteria, Criterion B (e.g., preoccupation with the deceased and/or circumstances of the death), or Criterion C (e.g., reactive distress and/or social/identity disruption) reported higher posttraumatic stress and depressive symptoms than youth who did not meet these criteria, η = .07-.16. Youth who met Criterion C reported greater functional impairment than youth who did not, η = .08-.12. Youth who qualified for the ""traumatic bereavement specifier"" reported more frequent posttraumatic stress symptoms than youth who did not, η = .04. Findings support the convergent, discriminant, and discriminant-groups validity, developmental appropriateness, and clinical utility of the PCBD Checklist.

High rates of sleep problems have been documented among trauma-exposed adults, particularly those diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); however, research with trauma-exposed children is relatively limited. Research specifically with child samples is critical due to the numerous developmental and functional implications that may result from sleep impairment. Characteristics of the traumatic event may play a key role in understanding sleep difficulties, yet, these associations are not well understood among trauma-exposed children. The current study therefore investigated whether aspects of the traumatic event (i.e., type, nature, chronicity, age of onset, removal from home, and complex trauma) were related to higher levels of sleep disturbances among 276 treatment-seeking children ages 6-18 years (M = 10.88, SD = 3.39; 63.4% female; 62.7% Black). Sleep problems were common in this sample. Domestic and community violence exposure were associated with higher levels of select sleep difficulties, as were interpersonal trauma, chronic trauma, a trauma that began early in life, and complex trauma. Nonetheless, type of trauma and characteristics of the traumatic event were largely unrelated to sleep problems on either caregiver's or children's reports. Removal from the home was not linked with sleep impairment. Although findings signify the relevance of sleep disturbances among trauma-exposed children, trauma characteristics may have limited influence on sleep problems.

Gun attitudes are a potential risk factor for gun violence; however, factors related to gun attitudes have not been identified. Mental illness such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is commonly discussed as a key factor in gun violence, despite research lacking in this area, and it is unknown whether symptoms of PTSD and probable PTSD are associated with more positive attitudes toward guns. The aim of the current study was to investigate the relations between PTSD symptoms and gun attitudes among 265 undergraduate students who experienced at least one interpersonal traumatic event ( M = 24.69 years, SD = 7.15 years, 75.6% female, 61.1% White). Path analysis revealed that individuals with PTSD symptoms above clinical cutoff were not more likely to have more positive gun attitudes. However, the PTSD symptom clusters evinced distinct relations with gun attitudes. Intrusion and avoidance symptoms were related to gun beliefs regarding protection, with intrusion symptoms being linked to a stronger belief that guns provide protection from crime and victimization (β = .23), whereas avoidance symptoms were inversely associated with this belief (β = -.22). Interestingly, neither trauma related in feelings and thoughts nor arousal and reactivity corresponded with gun attitudes. Certain PTSD symptom clusters may be relevant in understanding gun beliefs, with specific symptoms exhibiting distinct ties to gun attitudes.

Much of the prior literature is limited by the use of small sample sizes, measures of support without adequately reported psychometric properties, and inadequate or inconsistent definitions of support, which hinders the ability to accurately identify key predictors. Further, some potentially important predictors of parental support remain unexplored, including child-reported abuse stressors (e.g., family conflict, nonsupportive disclosure responses). The present study aimed to better delineate predictors of maternal belief and emotional support by examining the links between child, maternal, and family factors, and abuse characteristics as reported by both mothers and children. Two hundred and forty-seven treatment-seeking children (M age = 9.24, SD = 3.74) and their non-offending mothers were included in the study. Select demographic factors (i.e., child's age, minority status), abuse characteristics (i.e., use of penetration, repeated CSA incidents, and amount of CSA characteristics known), and child-reported abuse stressors were tied to levels of maternal belief and/or emotional support. Maternal and family characteristics were unrelated to support. The child's age and whether the abuse occurred more than once remained robust predictors of both aspects of support in multivariate analyses. The amount of CSA information known to the mother predicted emotional support, which may signal the utility of increasing parental knowledge of the abuse to bolster their emotional support. Findings indicate that there are several factors that may influence levels of maternal support, and children who experience certain types of CSA may be at greater risk for lower levels of belief and support.

The current study investigated whether children's use and perceived efficacy of avoidant, internalized, angry, and active/social coping strategies were associated with caregiver- and child-reported posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), and caregiver-reported internalizing and externalizing symptoms among 202 sexually abused children (8-12 years;  M = 10.47 years, SD = 1.70 years). Children reported using approximately eight types of coping strategies (M = 8.29, SD =2.50). Regression models indicated that internalized and angry coping were associated with child-reported PTSS. In contrast to expectations, none of the types of coping strategies were linked with caregiver's reports of PTSS or internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Interestingly, perceived efficacy of coping was largely unrelated to symptoms, with only perceived efficacy of avoidant coping inversely related to child-reported PTSS. Perceived efficacy was not tied to caregiver's reports of children's symptoms. Coping strategies may be associated with children's, but not caregiver's, reports of children's trauma-related difficulties. Furthermore, perceived efficacy of coping strategies may also be largely unrelated to children's symptoms, or children may have limited insight regarding the efficacy of their coping strategies. To further inform trauma-focused interventions that support effective long-term coping, future research should investigate which coping strategies children perceive to be efficacious, as well as potential reasons why.

Black children endorsed a greater number of trauma types and were more likely to have experienced community violence and have been placed in child protective custody than White children. Caregivers of White children endorsed higher levels of select internalizing symptoms and social concerns whereas Black children reported higher levels of sexual concerns than White children. White children who experience complex trauma may be at higher risk for some trauma-related difficulties. Alternatively, caregivers of White children may perceive them to have, or be more willing to acknowledge, higher levels of symptoms than Black children. Future work is needed to further investigate the role of race in disclosure of trauma exposure and related symptoms.

Gun violence among adolescents is similarly high, accounting for 18.7% of all firearm injuries from 2010 to 2016. Despite these statistics and evidence showing that TDV continues into adulthood as IPV, gun-related TDV has not received the same level of attention as adult IPV. In this scoping review, we are guided by the following questions: (1) what are the known risk and protective factors for gun-related TDV across micro (individual, interpersonal), mezzo (school, neighborhood), and macro (policy, social norms) domains? (2) What are the future directions for this area of research? Methods: We conducted a scoping review of eight academic databases to identify peer-reviewed studies examining risk and protective factors for gun-related TDV published in 1999–2019. Results: Our search returned few unique results (N = 16). Most of the published studies described the shared individual risk factors of gun carrying/access and TDV. Mezzo studies discussed TDV within the context of peer aggression or youth delinquency and gun carrying. There were zero macro studies meeting our search parameters. Conclusion: Our review suggests that adolescence may confer a unique blend of risk factors for both firearm and relationship violence, yet the intersection of these issues has received relatively little attention compared to gun violence in adult relationships. Areas for future inquiry involve increased surveillance of this issue and interventions addressing the shared risks for gun carrying/access and TDV.

Here, we argue that it is critical to identify factors that underlie impaired social functioning as well as processes that mediate the beneficial health effects of positive relationships in individuals exposed to CM. Key research recommendations are presented, focusing on: (1) identifying attachment-related alterations in specific inter- and intrapersonal processes (e.g., regulation of closeness and distance) that underlie problems in broader domains of social functioning (e.g., lack of perceived social support) in individuals affected by CM; (2) identifying internal (e.g., current emotional state) and external situational factors (e.g., cultural factors, presence of close others) that modulate alterations in specific social processes; and (3) identifying mechanisms that explain the positive health effects of intact social functioning. Methodological recommendations include: (1) assessing social processes through interactive and (close to) real-life assessments inside and outside the laboratory; (2) adopting an interdisciplinary, lifespan perspective to assess social processes, using multi-method assessments; (3) establishing global research collaborations to account for cultural influences on social processes and enable replications across laboratories and countries. The proposed line of research will contribute to globally develop and refine interventions that prevent CM and further positive relationships, which - likely through buffering the effects of chronic stress and corresponding allostatic load - foster resilience and improve mental and physical health, thereby reducing personal suffering and the societal and economic costs of CM and its consequences.

Specifically, it is unclear what factors are placing individuals with a history of child maltreatment (i.e., sexual abuse, physical abuse, and witnessing intimate partner violence [IPV]) at greater risk for subsequent adult victimization (i.e., sexual assault and IPV). Existing theoretical and empirical work on revictimization suggest that multiple risk factors are likely present within this framework (e.g., posttraumatic stress symptoms [PTSS], emotion dysregulation, and risk-taking behaviors). Prior research has suggested that PTSS are often linked with these other risk factors, and it is possible that the development of PTSS following child maltreatment may be related to the development or maintenance of additional factors that increase the likelihood of revictimization. The purpose of this review was to synthesize findings regarding risk factors that place maltreated individuals at greater risk for adult revictimization. Approximately 228 studies were identified following a thorough search of the peer-reviewed literature using multiple databases (PsycINFO, PILOTS, and Google Scholar). Each study was critically analyzed for relevance. The included studies were used in our review of prevalence, specific risk factors that have been identified, and unanswered questions in this literature. PTSS were noted to be particularly important in the revictimization framework, and thus, a novel model of revictimization was also proposed where PTSS are illustrated as being associated with the development and maintenance of other factors within the revictimization framework.",Hannah E Walker; Rachel Wamser-Nanney,,,,,,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

The field's knowledge of risk factors for dropout is growing; however, one aspect of the child's environment that remains unexamined is maternal support following the CSA disclosure/discovery. Maternal support has been theorized to play a valuable role in influencing children's outcomes after CSA and may be relevant in understanding attrition. The objective of the current study was to investigate the associations between children's symptoms, relationship to the perpetrator, and maternal support in relation to premature termination from TFT among 186 sexually abused children (M = 9.24 years, SD = 3.72, 67.3% female). Two operational definitions of attrition were used: (a) clinician-rated dropout (i.e., clinician's ratings of whether the child completed treatment) and (b) whether the child received an adequate treatment dose treatment (i.e., ≥12 sessions). Maternal marital status was the only factor associated with clinician-rated treatment dropout, OR = 2.35, whereas maternal support and blame/doubt were unrelated. Living farther from the clinic was tied to an increased risk of receiving an inadequate treatment dose, OR = 0.96. Replication of these findings is needed, particularly using a clinician-administered measure of caregiver support; yet, maternal emotional support and blame/doubt may not evince strong ties to dropout from TFT among sexually abused children. Additional work is needed to discern if there are key subgroups for whom support is more strongly related to the risk of premature termination following CSA.",Rachel Wamser-Nanney,,,,,,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Knowledge regarding what factors may be related to discordance is limited, and maternal support in relation to trauma-related symptom agreement has yet to be investigated. The aim of the present study was to examine the associations between discordance and both maternal emotional support and blame/doubt in caregivers' and children's reports of trauma-related symptoms in sexually abused children. Participants were treatment-seeking, sexually abused children (N = 122) aged 8-12 years (M = 9.45 years, SD = 1.09; 70.5% female, 57.4% White) and their nonoffending caregivers. Low intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) indicated the presence of significant discordance across symptom types, with caregivers reporting higher levels of trauma-related difficulties, ICCs = -.21-.22. Older children were more likely to disclose higher levels of anger and sexual concerns than younger children, βs = .18-.33. Children's gender, race, and relationship to their caregiver were not related to symptom discordance. Further, maternal emotional support and blame/doubt were not associated with caregiver-child concordance for any examined difficulties. Assessment of both caregivers' and children's perceptions of trauma-related symptoms is vital given the likelihood of discordance in child and caregiver reports of symptom levels. Although maternal emotional support and blame/doubt may not be linked to concordance with regard to trauma-related difficulties, child age should further be considered as a potentially important factor in understanding caregiver-child symptom concordance.",C L Campbell; Rachel Wamser-Nanney,,,,,,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

However, no studies have examined the racial disparity in posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) during COVID-19. Grounded in ecological theory and racial trauma framework, we investigated racial disparity in PTSS and three possible mechanisms, 1) COVID stress, 2) direct racism, and 3) indirect racism, for these disparities using a large U.S. national sample. Results indicated that POC reported higher levels of PTSS than White Americans. The PTSS racial disparity was accounted more by direct and indirect racism than by the COVID-19-specific stressors, after controlling for age, gender, education, income, parent status, adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), and intimate partner violence (IPV). Additional fine-grained analyses for Hispanic/Latinx Americans, Black/African Americans, and Asian American and Pacific Islanders by and large corroborated the above findings. Our findings highlighted the deleterious impact of the ongoing racism pandemic on the POC community as a public health crisis in addition to the COVID-19 pandemic.Supplemental data for this article is available online at at http://doi:10.1080/08964289.2021.2006131.",Via N Nguyen-Feng; Annett Lotzin; Rachel Wamser-Nanney; Xiang Zhou,,,,,,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Yet, as few studies have examined these links in a multivariate manner, it is unclear which symptoms are most strongly related to SBPs and ISBPs. Research regarding children's reports of their difficulties and SBPs and ISBPs is also very limited. The current study investigated the relations between both caregiver- and child-reported trauma-related symptoms and SBPs and ISBPs among 248 treatment-seeking sexually abused children (ages 6-12; M = 8.06, SD = 2.52; 64.5% female; 55.6% white). Children's caregiver-reported trauma-related sexual concerns and anger were associated with SBPs. For ISBPs, only caregiver-reported sexual concerns were related to ISBPs. Surprisingly, none of the child-reported symptoms were associated with either SBPs or ISBPs. Trauma-related sexual concerns and anger may be tied to SBPs, whereas other clinical difficulties may be less strongly implicated. Trauma-related sexual concerns may be most important in understanding interpersonally focused SBPs. Children's self-reported difficulties may be unrelated to caregiver-reported SBPs, or these results may be a function of a low degree of caregiver and child symptom concordance.

Children’s reports of abuse stressors have not been previously examined and may provide novel information. Posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) have also been linked with SBPs but have not been consistently accounted for in prior studies, which may obscure the true relationships between abuse characteristics and stressors with SBPs. Moreover, the term SBP consists of a range of behaviors, including interpersonally-focused SBPs (ISBPs), and the relationships between abuse characteristics and stressors may differ in the context of ISBPs. Objective: The present study determined whether caregiver-reported abuse characteristics, child-reported abuse stressors, and PTSS, were associated with both SBPs and ISBPs. Participants and setting: Two-hundred and fifty-four sexually abused children (ages 2–12; M = 7.69, SD = 2.67; 58.7 % female; 52.8 % white) participated in the study. Results: Child- and caregiver-reported level of PTSS were related to SBPs, and trends were noted for greater caregiver-reported abuse severity and child-reported abuse-related stressors. When ISBPs were examined, boys, younger children, greater CSA severity, and higher levels of PTSS were associated with higher levels of ISBPs. Conclusions: Level of PTSS may be important in identifying children at risk for SBPs and ISBPs, and CSA severity may be more relevant in the development or maintenance of ISBPs specifically.

Further, the associations between PTSS and parenting outcomes utilizing the most recent DSM-5 post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) criteria are unknown. The aims of the current study were to determine: (a) whether trauma exposure and PTSS are related to parenting indices; (b) if trauma exposure is associated with parenting factors indirectly through PTSS; and (c) whether the  PTSD symptom clusters are each linked with parenting outcomes. Participants were 225 trauma-exposed parents (M = 36.81; SD = 8.32) from a Midwestern University or Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Cumulative trauma had an indirect effect on parental satisfaction, support, involvement, limit-setting, and autonomy via PTSS. The specific PTSD symptom clusters also demonstrated distinct ties to parenting outcomes. Higher levels of alterations in reactivity and arousal symptoms were associated with lower parental support and satisfaction, as expected. Avoidance symptoms were also inversely related to parental autonomy. However, a positive relationship was noted between intrusion symptoms and support, and changes in cognitions and mood were unrelated to parenting indices. PTSS may better explain decrements in aspects of parenting than trauma exposure. Certain types of PTSD symptoms, particularly trauma-related changes in reactivity and arousal, may be relevant in understanding and improving parenting outcomes among trauma-exposed parents.

This is problematic as negative and unrealistic beliefs regarding parenthood and children may be a key mechanism by which PTSS increases vulnerability for adverse parenting outcomes. The aims of the study were to examine whether PTSS and the specific posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom clusters were related to more negative parenting perceptions and to more unrealistic beliefs regarding children's development among 212 trauma-exposed parents (M = 36.68 SD = 7.38; 60.9% female; 54.3% White). Higher levels of PTSS corresponded with more negative parenting perceptions and more unrealistic expectations of children. Intrusion, avoidance, and negative alterations in cognitions and mood were not associated with parenting perceptions. Trauma-related alterations in arousal and reactivity were related to more negative parenting-related beliefs regarding one's child and oneself. PTSS, particularly trauma-related changes in arousal and reactivity symptoms, may be relevant in understanding perceptions of parenthood and beliefs regarding children's development. These symptoms may be targeted via trauma-focused treatments to increase adaptive parenting outcomes for parents who have experienced trauma.

Method: This uncontrolled pilot feasibility study examined a sample of patients (n = 71) hospitalized due to violent injury at a Level 1 Trauma Center in [Location Redacted for Masked Review] between January 2013 and May 2014. Patients first participated in a brief assessment to identify risk factors for violence/violent injury. A single MI session then targeted risk behaviors identified for each patient. Proximal outcomes, including motivation for change and behaviors to reduce risk, were examined at 2 weeks and 6–12 weeks postdischarge. Distal outcomes, including fighting, weapon-carrying, and gun-carrying, and other violence risk factors were examined at 6- to 12-week follow-up. Results: An estimated 95 patients were offered participation, 79 (83.2%) agreed to participate, and 73 (76.8%) completed the risk assessment. Of these, 71 had at least 1 violence/violent injury risk factor. Behaviors to reduce risk were significantly greater at 2-week and 6-to 12-week follow-up (p values < .05). Fighting, weapon-carrying, and gun-carrying were significantly reduced at 6- to 12-week follow-up (p values < .05).

Yet, a recent meta-analysis indicates that this widely held belief may actually have limited empirical support. The lack of correspondence between maternal support and children's symptoms may be the result of the limitations of the prior literature including the use of maternal support measures with inadequate psychometric properties. The aim of the present study was to utilize the only published measure with sufficient psychometrics properties, the Maternal Self-Report Support Questionnaire (MSSQ; Smith et al., 2010), to determine the relationships between maternal support and demographic and family characteristics, parent-reported children's symptoms, and aspects of the traumatic event in a treatment-seeking sample. The sample included 252 treatment-seeking children (M=8.86, SD=3.85; 67.5% female, 59.5% White) and their mothers, who completed the MSSQ and other measures at pre-treatment. Mothers of older children, White children, and mothers with greater educational attainment reported higher levels of Emotional Support. Single mothers were more likely to report higher levels of Blame/Doubt than married mothers. Characteristics of the traumatic event, such as sexual abuse duration and number of sexual abuse incidents were negatively correlated with Emotional Support. Maternal support was related to relatively few of children's symptoms and was not associated with levels of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Although several demographic and family characteristics may be related to maternal support, it is a relatively weak predictor of children's outcomes.

Although both adversities may impact children’s mental health, studies have not yet attempted to disentangle the effects of parental illness versus those of parental death with regard to children’s psychological functioning. Further, there has been little empirical investigation of potential factors that may diminish risk for psychopathology following either of these adversities. The current study evaluated levels of anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in youth age 7–13 grappling with either parental cancer (N = 31) or parental death (N = 32) and examined potential predictors of these mental health outcomes across both groups of children. Youth contending with parental cancer exhibited lower levels of PTSS than children who had experienced the death of a parent, but both groups exhibited similar levels of anxiety and depression. Expressive coping was associated with lower levels of PTSS, anxiety, and depression across both groups. An interaction effect revealed that for the bereaved group only, positive parental reinforcement and supportive caregiver communication were inversely associated with PTSS. These findings provide a foundation for future work designed to identify factors associated with distinct mental health outcomes among children facing parental cancer and/or parental death.

The purposes of the current study were to (1) examine the relationships between support and children's sexual behaviors and (2) determine whether support is related to sexual behaviors after controlling for known predictors among 161 treatment-seeking children (6-12 years old; M = 8.70, SD = 2.69) and their nonoffending mothers. In the bivariate analyses, emotional support was negatively related to children's sexual behaviors, whereas maternal blame/doubt was positively correlated with sexual behaviors. Nonetheless, after controlling for other predictors, emotional support predicted developmentally related sexual behaviors but not sexual abuse-specific sexual behaviors. Levels of emotional support and blame/doubt predicted children's total sexual behaviors, after accounting for identified predictors, suggesting that support may play a small role in understanding children's sexual behaviors.

Method: Seventy-two gun violence victims reported on their gun violence involvement and gun violence risk factors (e.g., gun ownership, gun carrying, gun arrests, impulsivity, perceptions regarding violence) at hospital bedside. Results: Childhood DV and CV exposure were both associated with increased gun violence involvement as well as numerous gun violence risk factors. Effect sizes were generally medium to large (M d = .53). Conclusion: Childhood traumatic events, such as DV and CV, may be important antecedent risk factors for gun violence.

The role of pretrauma beliefs about power and control, however, remains unclear. Though a strong pretrauma belief in power and control may similarly be protective, we predicted such a belief may actually be a diathesis for PTSD. When exposed to trauma, individuals with a strong pretrauma belief in power and control may believe they should have prevented the trauma and/or their acute reactions. Such expectations may lead to negative self-beliefs and a higher level of PTSD symptoms. Longitudinal structural equation modeling in a sample of combat soldiers (N = 305) supported our hypothesized model. Stronger predeployment power and control beliefs predicted more negative postdeployment self-beliefs, β = .15, p = .035, 95% CI [.11, .18], and in turn, a higher level of PTSD symptoms, β = .08, 95% CI [.01, .15]. Prior combat exposure moderated these effects in that soldiers with no prior combat experience evidenced the hypothesized associations, whereas those with moderate or high prior combat exposure did not. Resilience interventions for soldiers who are first entering combat may thus benefit from promoting acceptance of uncontrollable events in addition to agentic change skills.

Rachel,Wamser,White matter fiber bundle lengths are shorter in cART naive HIV: an analysis of quantitative diffusion tractography in South Africa,Brain imaging and behavior,11/6/2017,2017.0,,,,,Completed/Published,10.1007/s11682-017-9769-9,29110194,PMC5936682,1931-7565,Fall,2017,"This study examines white matter microstructure using quantitative tractography diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (qtdMRI) in HIV+ individuals from South Africa who were naïve or early in the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. Fiber bundle length (FBL) metrics, generated from qtdMRI, for whole brain and six white matter tracts of interest (TOI) were assessed for 135 HIV+ and 21 HIV- individuals. The association between FBL metrics, measures of disease burden, and neuropsychological performance were also investigated. Results indicate significantly reduced sum of whole brain fiber bundle lengths (FBL, p < 0.001), but not average whole brain FBL in the HIV+ group compared to the HIV- controls. The HIV+ group exhibited significantly shorter sum of FBL in all six TOIs examined: the anterior thalamic radiation, cingulum bundle, inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculi, inferior frontal occipital fasciculus, and the uncinate fasciculus. Additionally, average FBLs were significantly shorter select TOIs including the inferior longitudinal fasciculus, cingulum bundle, and the anterior thalamic radiation. Shorter whole brain FBL sum metrics were associated with poorer neuropsychological performance, but were not associated with markers of disease burden. Taken together these findings suggest HIV affects white matter architecture primarily through reductions in white matter fiber numbers and, to a lesser degree, the shortening of fibers along a bundle path.

Prior studies may have failed to find a relationship between maternal support and children's outcomes due to the methodological weaknesses of the prior literature such as the use of maternal support measures without adequately reported psychometric properties. Moreover, relatively few studies have investigated whether maternal support corresponds with children's own self-reported symptoms. The aim of the present study was to utilize the only published measure of maternal support with sufficient psychometrics, the Maternal Self-Report Support Questionnaire (MSSQ; Smith et al., 2010), to determine if levels of pre-treatment support are associated with children's self-reported trauma-related symptoms among 165 treatment-seeking children (M=10.85, SD=3.09) and their non-offending mothers. Levels of maternal emotional support corresponded with few of children's outcomes, and when relationships were observed, emotional support was related to higher levels of symptoms. Maternal levels of blame and doubt were only associated with dissociative symptoms. Maternal support therefore appears to be an ineffective predictor of children's post-disclosure trajectories and raises the possibility that maternal support is linked with poorer functioning.

Yet considerably less work has been focused on sleep disturbances among trauma-exposed children, especially preschoolers. Pediatric research is paramount in light of the numerous developmental and functional implications that may result from sleep impairment. Prior studies have also documented disagreement between caregiver’s and children’s reports of trauma-related symptoms; however, the level of concordance rates regarding sleep difficulties is unknown in this population. The present study investigated the rates of multiple types of sleep disturbances using caregiver’s and children’s reports as well as caregiver-child concordance rates regarding these difficulties. Three hundred and forty-two treatment-seeking children ages of 3–18 years (M = 9.68, SD = 4.00; 61.1% female, 60.4% Black) and their caregivers were included in the study. Sleep disturbances were common in this sample, and children endorsed higher levels of sleep symptoms (range 46–72%) than their caregivers (range 14–51%). Nearly half (47%) of preschool children evinced significant sleep impairment per their caregiver. Inter-rater agreement between caregiver’s and children’s reports for all sleep symptoms were below acceptable levels (range κ = 0.01-.13), indicating that the concordance rate for caregiver-child trauma-related sleep problems is quite low. Findings illustrate the relevance of sleep disturbances among trauma-exposed children and point to the need to assess both caregiver’s and children’s symptoms regarding sleep impairment.

Yet, the literature has largely focused on sexual revictimization, while relations between maltreatment and other adult victimization types (e.g., intimate partner violence [IPV]) are less clear. Further, associations between emotion dysregulation and both child and adult trauma exposure have been identified, but aspects of dysregulation (i.e., nonacceptance of emotional responses, difficulties engaging in goal-directed behavior, impulsivity, lack of emotional awareness, limited access to ER strategies, and lack of emotional clarity) have received less attention. This study aimed to: (1) investigate the associations between maltreatment and adult victimization and the six ER dimensions while accounting for PTSS, and (2) determine whether there are indirect effects between maltreatment and adult victimization through each ER component. Seven hundred and forty-four undergraduates from two universities participated in the study ( = 21.48,  = 4.12; 80.9% women; 56.2% white). Maltreatment and PTSS were directly linked with adult victimization ( = 0.14,  = 0.01, respectively). PTSS was inversely associated with each ER aspect ( = 0.02-0.10). Unexpectedly, neither maltreatment nor adult victimization was related to the ER dimensions, and no indirect effects were observed between maltreatment and adult victimization through emotion dysregulation. These findings suggest that specific components of emotion dysregulation may not be tied to trauma exposure outside of PTSS. Further, it may be that the ER dimensions are not differentially related to increased risk for adult victimization.",Lacy E Jamison; Kari N Thomsen; Hannah E Walker; Kat H Howell; Rachel Wamser-Nanney,,,,,,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

At the individual level, higher emotion dysregulation was associated with higher PTSS and lower resilience; anger severity was not related to either outcome. At the relational level, more friend support was negatively associated with PTSS. Friend and family support were positively related to resilience. At the contextual level, community cohesion was positively associated with resilience, but not PTSS, and community disorder was unrelated to both outcomes.

Nonetheless, attrition from TF-CBT is quite common, and children who do not receive the full intervention may continue to suffer from trauma-related symptoms. Rates of premature termination have varied across studies, and to date, no meta-analyses have been conducted regarding dropout from TF-CBT. The objective of the present study was to conduct a meta-analysis of the rates of attrition from TF-CBT, as well as review factors related to premature termination from this intervention. A total of 22 studies were available for inclusion in this meta-analysis. The prevalence of attrition was 33.9% (95% CI [26.2%, 42.5%]) from 2,059 children receiving TF-CBT. Clinician-rated attrition was 38.5%, and 17.5% did not receive an adequate dose of TF-CBT (e.g., 12+ sessions). Further, the study type was related to differing rates of dropout, with randomized controlled trials having a much lower attrition rate. Regarding risk factors for premature termination, the emerging literature suggests that a child's age, racial-ethnic minority status, and symptom levels may evince some ties to attrition. Caregiver, family, therapist, and treatment factors remain underexplored in relation to premature termination; however, preliminary work suggests that lack of caregiver attendance and difficulty in the child-therapist relationship may be related to attrition.

The present study aimed to (a) examine the links between partner perceptions, three PTSD symptom clusters (i.e., avoidance, negative alterations in cognitions and mood, changes in arousal and reactivity), and aspects of parenting (i.e., support, satisfaction, involvement) and (b) determine if partner perceptions moderate these relationships. Method: In total, 225 trauma-exposed parents (M = 36.87, SD = 8.32, 64% female, 52.9% White) were assessed via self-report measures. Results: As expected, the negative alterations in cognitions and mood and arousal and reactivity clusters were negatively associated with partner perceptions (r = −.17 and −.24, respectively) and all three parenting indices (rs = −.15 to −.35). Avoidance symptoms were unrelated to partner perceptions but were tied to parental support and satisfaction (rs = −.15). Partner perceptions moderated the relationships between negative alterations in cognitions and mood and support and satisfaction (βs = .02), as well as changes in arousal and reactivity and support (β = .02). Conclusions: Parents with negative alterations in cognitions and mood and arousal and reactivity symptoms who perceive their partners negatively may be at higher risk for experiencing lower levels of parental support or satisfaction. Additionally, the negative links between the aforementioned symptom clusters and parenting disappeared in the context of positive partner perceptions, indicating a potential protective factor.

Rachel,Wamser,Caregiver-Child Symptom Concordance: Links to Premature Termination From Trauma-Focused Therapy,Journal of interpersonal violence,6/13/2020,2020.0,,8.86E+14,,,Completed/Published,10.1177/0886260520929654,32538294,,1552-6518,Summer,2020,"Rates of attrition from child trauma-focused treatment are high, yet few predictors of premature termination are known. Caregiver-child symptom discrepancies are common in this population and have been related to treatment outcome. However, research has not examined whether caregiver-child symptom concordance is associated with attrition. The aim of the study was to determine whether pretreatment caregiver-child symptom agreement predicted premature termination from trauma-focused treatment. Two hundred and sixty-nine treatment-seeking children ages 8 to 12 (M = 9.97, SD = 1.49; 64.7% female, 51.3% Black) and their non-offending caregivers were included in the study. Two operational definitions of attrition are as follows: (a) clinician-rated dropout, and (b) whether the child received an adequate dose of treatment (i.e., 12 or more sessions), which were used to more thoroughly examine premature termination. Rates of attrition were high (68.1% clinician-rated premature termination, 37.4% received inadequate dose). Levels of symptom concordance between caregivers and children were low across symptom difficulties (intraclass correlations = .003-.16). Lower levels of discordance for posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) were associated with an increased likelihood of receiving an adequate dose of treatment (odds ratio [OR] = 1.03). Nonetheless, unexpectedly, higher levels of caregiver-child discordance for anxiety symptoms at pretreatment predicted both clinician-rated treatment completion and adequate dose (ORs = .97, .96, respectively). However, caregiver's and children's perceptions of children's trauma-related difficulties may not converge, and thus, both reports are important to assess. Symptom disagreement regarding PTSS may help identify families at risk for attrition.

Although nonsexual trauma exposure has been linked to aggression, the associations between sexual assault and aggression are understudied. Further, the DSM-5 conceptualization of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) includes a symptom related to aggression, and associations between symptom clusters and aggression with regard to the new criteria are underexplored. The present study aimed to (a) examine the relations between sexual assault and indices of aggression (i.e., physical/verbal aggression, anger, and hostility) after accounting for PTSS and (b) investigate PTSD symptom clusters in relation to aggression among 263 women (M = 29.03 years, SD = 11.71; 67.6% white). Path analysis revealed that sexual assault was unrelated to indices of aggression, βs = .003-.08; however, PTSS was consistently linked with increased aggression, βs = .22-.49. Results indicated specificity in the associations between the symptom clusters and aspects of aggression. Negative alterations in cognitions and mood corresponded with increased physical aggression, β = .28, and hostility, β = .38, and avoidance was related to verbal aggression, β = .19. Hyperarousal was also tied to higher levels of anger, hostility, and verbal aggression, βs = .21-.33. Nonetheless, lower levels of intrusion symptoms were associated with increased anger and hostility, β = -.26. With regard to understanding women's risk for aggression, PTSS may be more relevant than sexual assault. Further, there may be specificity related to the type of PTSD symptoms and aspects of aggression.

Rachel,Wamser,Understanding Gun Violence: Introduction to the Special Issue on Gun Violence,Psychology of Violence,,2021.0,,,,,In Press,,,,,Spring,2023,"Objective: Gun violence is a pressing public health concern, particularly in the United States. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, 2020 was a record-breaking year with 43,551 deaths attributed to gun violence in the U.S., with almost 20,000 classified as murder/unintentional death and more than 24,000 classified as suicide (Gun Violence Archive, 2021). Black men are 10 times more likely to die from gun violence than are white men (CDC, 2020c). Yet, in proportion to these sobering statistics, researchers’ knowledge of the range of causes and possible remedies remains negligible. The purpose of this Special Issue of the Psychology of Violence devoted to Gun Violence was to highlight and spur additional, psychologically-oriented research regarding firearm violence. Method: This Special Issue consists of seven original U.S.-based studies that address various aspects of gun violence, including individual, geographical, psychological, and sociological factors associated with attitudes towards guns, gun policies, and gun violence. Results: Individually and collectively, these studies provide novel insights regarding different types of gun perceptions and beliefs. These works consider a wide range of factors including media exposure, beliefs about the link between mental illness and gun violence, cumulative trauma, masculinity norms, regional norms, and trust in law enforcement. Discussion: This Special Issue is intended to spark greater interest in working to mitigate firearm violence and encourage researchers across scientific disciplines to collaboratively apply their theoretical perspectives and methodologies to reduce the devastating, but understudied, U.S. gun violence epidemic.

Rachel,Wamser,"Trauma exposure, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and attitudes towards guns",Psychology of Violence,,2020.0,,,,,Completed/Published,,,,,Fall,2020,"Objective: Although gun violence is a significant public health concern, many aspects of gun violence remain grossly understudied, including factors that shape firearm perceptions and beliefs. Trauma exposure and levels of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSSs) may play a role in understanding gun attitudes; however, these putative associations have not been empirically determined. The aim of the study was to investigate if cumulative trauma, specific violent trauma types (i.e., violent death, and physical, weapon, and sexual assault), and PTSS are related to more positive gun attitudes. Method: A total of 495 adults from Amazon Mechanical Turk (18.5%) or a midwestern university (81.4%; Mage = 25.81 SD = 9.88, 59.5% female, 71.2% White) participated in the study. Results: Cumulative trauma was associated with more progun rights beliefs but not with perceptions that guns provide protection from victimization or deter crime. Despite expectations, PTSSs were not tied to gun attitudes. In the model with the specific types of violent trauma, weapon assault was related to a stronger endorsement that guns offer protection, whereas physical assault was inversely associated with this belief. None of the four types of violent trauma nor PTSS were related to beliefs regarding gun rights or guns and crime. Conclusion: Although PTSS was consistently unrelated to gun attitudes, cumulative trauma exposure may correspond with gun rights beliefs. There also appears to be distinctions in type of violent trauma exposure and discrete gun attitudes.

However, the interactions between childhood interpersonal trauma, religious coping, and psychological outcomes are less clear. This study examined whether aspects of religious coping moderated the associations between cumulative childhood interpersonal trauma and mental health outcomes, such as post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and resilience. Participants included 525 undergraduates from two universities (Mage = 20.04, SD = 1.71; range = 18-24; 57.7% White; 82.1% female). In both the positive and negative religious coping models, cumulative childhood interpersonal trauma was related to PTSS (b = 6.66; b = 6.10, respectively). While positive religious coping was not associated with PTSS (b = .01), it was linked to resilience (b = .69). Negative religious coping was significantly related to PTSS (b = .75) but not resilience (b = -.20). No significant interactions were identified between aspects of religious coping and cumulative childhood interpersonal trauma. While religious coping was directly related to both positive and negative mental health outcomes, it may not be associated with the relationships between childhood interpersonal trauma exposure and clinical outcomes. Such findings offer valuable information on malleable factors that may contribute to adaptive and maladaptive functioning following childhood adversity.

This is problematic as negative and unrealistic beliefs regarding parenthood and children may be a key mechanism by which PTSS increases vulnerability for adverse parenting outcomes. The aims of the study were to examine whether PTSS and the specific posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom clusters were related to more negative parenting perceptions and to more unrealistic beliefs regarding children’s development among 212 trauma-exposed parents (Mage = 36.68 SD = 7.38; 60.9% female; 54.3% White). Higher levels of PTSS corresponded with more negative parenting perceptions and more unrealistic expectations of children. Intrusion, avoidance, and negative alterations in cognitions and mood were not associated with parenting perceptions. Trauma-related alterations in arousal and reactivity were related to more negative parenting-related beliefs regarding one’s child and oneself. PTSS, particularly trauma-related changes in arousal and reactivity symptoms, may be relevant in understanding perceptions of parenthood and beliefs regarding children’s development. These symptoms may be targeted via trauma-focused treatments to increase adaptive parenting outcomes for parents who have experienced trauma.

Rachel,Wamser,Sexual Behavior Problems and Premature Termination from Pediatric Trauma-Focused Treatment Among Sexually Abused Children,Journal of traumatic stress,6/1/2020,2020.0,,,,,Completed/Published,10.1002/jts.22518,32479696,,1573-6598,Summer,2020,"Premature termination from child trauma-focused treatment is common; however, the role of children's level of symptoms as a risk factor for attrition remains uncertain. In particular, children's sexual behavior problems (SBPs) have received scant attention in the prior attrition literature, and no known studies to date have thoroughly examined SBPs in relation to premature treatment termination. The current study investigated whether higher levels of children's SBPs were associated with increased risk for attrition from trauma-focused treatment in a sample of 242 sexually abused children aged 2-12 years (M = 7.48 years, SD = 2.68; 64.5% female, 54.1% White). To assess the potential associations between SBPs and treatment dropout more thoroughly, two definitions of attrition were utilized: (a) clinician-rated dropout and (b) whether the child received an adequate dose of treatment (i.e., 12 or more sessions). Whereas only 34.3% of the children completed treatment per their clinician, 69.4% received an adequate dose of treatment. In contrast to the study hypotheses, neither development-related nor sexual abuse-specific SBPs were associated with either clinician-rated dropout or adequate dose status, ORs = 0.99-1.00. Sexual acting-out behaviors in sexually abused children may not correspond with attrition from trauma-focused treatment at multiple points of treatment. Given the heterogeneity of SBPs, further assessment of whether attrition patterns differ across subgroups of children who exhibit SBPs is needed.

Further, even though mediators and moderators are conceptually distinct, maternal support has been theorized to be both a mediator and a moderator of symptoms, and it is unclear if support acts as either among sexually abused children. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether caregiver-reported maternal support mediates or moderates the relationships between sexual abuse severity and children's trauma-related symptoms. The study included 235 treatment-seeking children ages 3-16 (M = 8.85, SD = 3.77) and their non-offending mothers. Contrary to expectations, caregiver-rated maternal support did not mediate nor moderate the relationship between abuse severity and children's symptoms (range Bs =.002 -.03). Caregiver-rated maternal support may play a small role in mitigating sexually abused children's trauma symptoms. Irrespective of abuse severity, children with less supportive mothers may not be at heightened risk for experiencing higher levels of trauma-related difficulties.

Considerably less is known regarding what factors may correspond with parenting attitudes, particularly among at-risk samples. In line with theoretical models of the determinants of parenting, the aim of the study was to investigate correlates of parenting attitudes among child, caregiver, family, and neighborhood factors. Participants and settings/methods: The study included 1071 4-year-old children (48.8 % female; 55.7 % Black) and their caregivers from the Longitudinal Studies in Child Abuse and Neglect (LONGSCAN) study. Results: Numerous factors were consistently related to more positive parenting attitudes (i.e., more appropriate parenting expectations, greater empathy, and valuing non-physical punishment), including greater educational attainment, caregiver history of child sexual and physical abuse, lower levels of children’s internalizing symptoms, greater family income, and lower levels of psychological aggression. Lower levels of caregiver depressive symptoms, greater number of maltreatment allegations, use of nonviolent discipline, and less severity of stressful life events were tied to more adaptive parenting attitudes in one or two domains. Conclusions: Caregiver, child, familial, and environmental factors, as well as child maltreatment, may be important in determining parenting attitudes. Identification of the drivers of parenting attitudes may aid identification and intervention efforts with high-risk samples of caregivers to help improve parenting outcomes.

The aim of the current study was to examine the degree of concordance between children's and caregivers' reports of trauma-related difficulties and determine whether any child or family characteristics were associated with symptom agreement. Three hundred thirteen trauma-exposed children (M = 9.55,  SD = 1.77; 65.2% girls, 51.3% Black) and their nonoffending caregivers seeking treatment were included in the study. Children's and caregivers' reports of trauma-related difficulties were related, but low intraclass correlation coefficients indicated poor concordance across symptoms. Child's gender was associated with levels of concordance for several trauma-related difficulties (e.g., anxiety, depression, anger, dissociation, and sexual concerns), with lower symptom agreement for girls. Child's age, minority status, and relationship to caregiver emerged as factors related to levels of concordance for certain trauma-related symptoms. Child's gender, age, minority status, and relationship to caregiver may predict symptom discordance for select trauma-related difficulties, whereas other family factors such as caregiver marital status and income may be unrelated. Given the importance of caregiver-child concordance in treatment success, additional research should investigate other factors that may influence trauma-related symptom agreement.

Research has not determined if PTSD symptoms correspond with more negative expectations of parenthood and unrealistic beliefs regarding children's developmental milestones. Negative and unrealistic preparenthood and developmental expectations are tied to problematic parenting-related outcomes; thus, these beliefs are important to examine within the context of PTSD. The aim of the current study was to examine whether PTSD is related to negative parenthood expectations as well as more unrealistic perceptions of children's development. Included in the study were 368 trauma-exposed adults who had yet to become parents (M = 25.92 years, SD  = 7.11; 68.2% female; 63.8% White). Structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed that probable PTSD was associated with more negative parenting expectations, βs = -.08--.16.

However, higher levels of intrusion symptoms were related to more positive expectations of parenthood and more realistic development expectations, βs = .17-.25. The data were a satisfactory fit for the model. Thus, PTSD may be relevant in understanding perceptions of parenthood, which may be important to address and ultimately improve parenting outcomes among parents with PTSD.

However, there are discrepancies regarding the factor structure of event centrality, as the factor structure may differ depending on the nature of the trauma. Event centrality has predicted posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); yet, few studies have taken into account other key cognitive predictors of PTSD, such as posttraumatic cognitions. The PTSD symptom clusters also remain largely unexamined, despite potential specificity in their ties to event centrality. The aims of the current study were to: (a) examine the factor structure of event centrality and whether the structure differs following interpersonal versus noninterpersonal trauma; (b) investigate whether event centrality predicts PTSD symptom clusters beyond posttraumatic cognitions; and (c) determine if the associations between event centrality, posttraumatic cognitions, and PTSD are equivalent between trauma types. The study aims were examined utilizing 263 college students (M = 24.54, SD = 6.29; 79.8% female; 58% White). Event centrality was best represented by one factor, which was consistent between groups. Structural equation models indicated that event centrality and posttraumatic cognitions regarding the self predicted each of the PTSD symptom clusters across groups, βs = .27-.58. However, event centrality was more strongly related to avoidance symptoms among individuals who experienced a noninterpersonal trauma. For both the interpersonal and noninterpersonal groups, event centrality had equivalent ties to each cluster. Even after accounting for negative trauma-related beliefs, event centrality appears to be relevant in understanding posttrauma functioning.

One hundred seventy-two children aged 6-18 (M = 10.53, SD = 3.36; 64% female, 64% Black) and their caregivers were included in the study. Two operational definitions of attrition were utilized: (1) clinician-rated dropout and (2) whether the child received an adequate dose of treatment (i.e., 12 or more sessions). Rates of clinician-rated attrition were high (76.2%); however, 73.8% received an adequate dose. Despite expectations, higher levels of rule-breaking and aggressive behavior were related to clinician-rated dropout (B = 0.59, .63, respectively) but were not significant predictors in a logistic regression model. Child-reported symptoms were unrelated to clinician-rated attrition. Higher levels of caregiver-reported anxiety/depression, somatic complaints, and trauma-related difficulties corresponded with adequate dose (rs = 0.52-1.06). Yet only caregiver-reported sexual concerns predicted adequate dose in a regression model ( B = 1.09). Caregiver- and child-reported symptoms may be unrelated to clinician-rated treatment completion and appear to play a small role in understanding whether the child received an adequate dose of treatment.

Rachel,Wamser,Guns and intimate partner violence among adolescents: A scoping review,Journal of Family Violence,,2020.0,,,,,Completed/Published,10.1007/s10896-020-00193-x,,,,Fall,2020,"Purpose: Intimate partner violence (IPV) among adolescents, or teen dating violence (TDV), is a significant public health issue that may affect up to two-thirds of youth aged 12–18. Gun violence among adolescents is similarly high, accounting for 18.7% of all firearm injuries from 2010 to 2016. Despite these statistics and evidence showing that TDV continues into adulthood as IPV, gun-related TDV has not received the same level of attention as adult IPV. In this scoping review, we are guided by the following questions: (1) what are the known risk and protective factors for gun-related TDV across micro (individual, interpersonal), mezzo (school, neighborhood), and macro (policy, social norms) domains? (2) What are the future directions for this area of research? Methods: We conducted a scoping review of eight academic databases to identify peer-reviewed studies examining risk and protective factors for gun-related TDV published in 1999–2019. Results: Our search returned few unique results (N = 16). Most of the published studies described the shared individual risk factors of gun carrying/access and TDV. Mezzo studies discussed TDV within the context of peer aggression or youth delinquency and gun carrying. There were zero macro studies meeting our search parameters. Conclusion: Our review suggests that adolescence may confer a unique blend of risk factors for both firearm and relationship violence, yet the intersection of these issues has received relatively little attention compared to gun violence in adult relationships. Areas for future inquiry involve increased surveillance of this issue and interventions addressing the shared risks for gun carrying/access and TDV.

However, little is known about the topological organization of whole-brain networks and the corresponding association with cognition. As such, we examined structural whole-brain white matter connectivity patterns and cognitive performance in 29 HIV+ young adults (mean age = 25.9) with limited or no HIV treatment history. HIV+ participants and demographically similar HIV- controls (n = 16) residing in South Africa underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neuropsychological testing. Structural network models were constructed using diffusion MRI-based multifiber tractography and T1-weighted MRI-based regional gray matter segmentation. Global network measures included whole-brain structural integration, connection strength, and structural segregation. Cognition was measured using a neuropsychological global deficit score (GDS) as well as individual cognitive domains. Results revealed that HIV+ participants exhibited significant disruptions to whole-brain networks, characterized by weaker structural integration (characteristic path length and efficiency), connection strength, and structural segregation (clustering coefficient) than HIV- controls (p < 0.05). GDSs and performance on learning/recall tasks were negatively correlated with the clustering coefficient (p < 0.05) in HIV+ participants.

Further, the impact of the threonine variant on cognitive function remains unknown. The present study utilized multiple indices of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neuropsychological assessment to examine the integrity of specific white matter tracts and cognition between individuals with homozygous genotypes of M268T (MetMet n=27, ThrThr n=27). Differences in subcortical hyperintensity (SH) volume were also examined between groups. Results indicated that the threonine variant was associated with significantly reduced integrity in the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) and the cingulate gyrus segment of the cingulum bundle (cingulum CG) compared to those with the methionine variant, and poorer cognitive performance on tests of attention/processing speed and language. Despite these associations, integrity of these tracts did not significantly mediate relationships between cognition and genetic status, and SH did not differ significantly between groups.

While previous studies have established age-related changes in white matter (WM) diffusion using DTI, the impact of age on gray matter (GM) diffusion remains unclear. The present study utilized DTI metrics of mean diffusivity (MD) to identify age differences in GM/WM microstructure in a sample of healthy older adults (N = 60). A secondary aim was to determine the functional significance of whole-brain GM/WM MD on global cognitive function using the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). Participants were divided into three age brackets (ages 50-59, 60-69, and 70+) to examine differences in MD and cognition by decade. MD was examined bilaterally in the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes for the primary analyses and an aggregate measure of whole-brain MD was used to test relationships with cognition. Significantly higher MD was observed in bilateral GM of the temporal and parietal lobes, and in right hemisphere WM of the frontal and temporal lobes of older individuals. The most robust differences in MD were between the 50-59 and 70+ age groups. Higher whole-brain GM MD was associated with poorer RBANS performance in the 60-69 age group.

When examined in preclinical studies, a cysteine to serine substitution in the C31 dicysteine motif of the HIV-C Tat protein (C31S) results in less severe brain injury compared to other viral clades. By contrast, patient cohort studies identify significant neuropsychological impairment among HIV-C individuals independent of Tat variability. The present study clarified this discrepancy by examining neuroimaging markers of brain integrity among HIV-C individuals with and without the Tat substitution. Thirty-seven HIV-C individuals with the Tat C31S substitution, 109 HIV-C individuals without the Tat substitution (C31C), and 34 HIV- controls underwent 3T structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Volumes were determined for the caudate, putamen, thalamus, corpus callosum, total gray matter, and total white matter. DTI metrics included fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD). Tracts of interest included the anterior thalamic radiation (ATR), cingulum bundle (CING), uncinate fasciculus (UNC), and corpus callosum (CC). HIV+ individuals exhibited smaller volumes in subcortical gray matter, total gray matter and total white matter compared to HIV- controls. HIV+ individuals also exhibited DTI abnormalities across multiple tracts compared to HIV- controls. By contrast, neither volumetric nor diffusion indices differed significantly between the Tat C31S and C31C groups. Tat C31S status is not a sufficient biomarker of HIV-related brain integrity in patient populations.

Reduced EF and CPS are known to correlate with age-related frontal-lobe volume loss. However, it remains unclear whether white matter microstructure in these regions is associated with age-related decline in EF and/or CPS. We utilized quantitative tractography metrics derived from diffusion-tensor MRI to investigate the relationship between the mean fiber bundle lengths (FBLs) projecting to different lobes, and EF/CPS performance in 73 healthy aging adults. We measured aspects of EF and CPS with the Trail Making Test (TMT), Color-Word Interference Test, Letter-Number Sequencing (L-N Seq), and Symbol Coding. Results revealed that parietal and occipital FBLs explained a significant portion of variance in EF. Frontal, temporal, and occipital FBLs explained a significant portion of variance in CPS. Shorter occipital FBLs were associated with poorer performance on the EF tests TMT-B and CWIT 3. Shorter frontal, parietal, and occipital FBLs were associated with poorer performance on L-N Seq and Symbol Coding. Shorter frontal and temporal FBLs were associated with lower performance on CPS tests TMT-A and CWIT 1. Shorter FBLs were also associated with increased age. Results suggest an age-related FBL shortening in specific brain regions related to poorer EF and CPS performance among older adults. Overall, results support both the frontal aging hypothesis and processing speed theory, suggesting that each mechanism is contributing to age-related cognitive decline.",Jacob Bolzenius; Ashley M Behrman-Lay; Christina Usher; Thomas E Conturo; Stephen Correia; David H Laidlaw; Elizabeth M Lane; Jodi M Heaps; Laur E Salminen; Laurie M Baker; Ryan Cabeen; Erbil Akbudak; Xi Luo; Peisi Yan; Robert H Paul,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,International,Research Board,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Co-author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Sixty-four HIV-infected adults on HAART were assigned a CPE score using a published ranking system and divided into high (≥7; n = 35) and low (<7; n = 29) CPE groups. All participants completed neuropsychological testing in addition to structural neuroimaging. Neuropsychological tests included measures known to be sensitive to HIV with values converted into standardized scores (NPZ-4) based on published normative scores. A semi-automated methodology was utilized to assess brain volumetrics within cortical (grey and white matter) and subcortical (thalamus, caudate, putamen) regions of interest. Analyses assessed NPZ-4 and brain volumetric differences between HIV+ individuals with high and low CPE scores. No significant differences in brain integrity were observed between the two groups.

Our aim was to determine, in a South African cohort of PWH (N = 148), (a) how much variation in reported rates was due to method used to define cognitive impairment and (b) which method correlated best with MRI biomarkers of HIV-related brain pathology. Participants completed detailed neuropsychological assessment and underwent 3 T structural MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We used the neuropsychological data to investigate 20 different methods of determining HIV-associated cognitive impairment. We used the neuroimaging data to obtain volumes for cortical and subcortical grey matter and total white matter and DTI metrics for several white matter tracts. Applying each of the 20 methods to the cognitive dataset resulted in a wide variation (20-97%) in estimated rates of impairment. Logistic regression models showed no method was associated with HIV-related neuroimaging abnormalities as measured by structural volumes or DTI metrics. We conclude that for the population from which this sample was drawn, much of the variation in reported rates of cognitive impairment in PWH is due to the method of classification used, and that none of these methods accurately reflects biological effects of HIV in the brain.

This study examined CR as a potential moderator of cognitive performance and brain integrity as defined by FBL. Sixty-three healthy adults underwent neuropsychological evaluation and 3T brain magnetic resonance imaging. Cognitive performance was measured using the Repeatable Battery of Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). FBL was quantified from tractography tracings of white matter fiber bundles, derived from the diffusion tensor imaging. CR was determined by estimated premorbid IQ. Analyses revealed that lower scores on the RBANS were associated with shorter whole brain FBL (p = 0.04) and lower CR (p = 0.01) CR moderated the relationship between whole brain FBL and RBANS score (p < 0.01). Tract-specific analyses revealed that CR also moderated the association between FBL in the hippocampal segment of the cingulum and RBANS performance (p = 0.03). These results demonstrate that lower cognitive performance on the RBANS is more common with low CR and short FBL. On the contrary, when individuals have high CR, the relationship between FBL and cognitive performance is attenuated.

Twenty-five HIV+ patients, 21 HIV+/HCV+ patients, and 25 HIV- controls were included in this study. All HIV+ individuals were stable on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART; ≥3 months). All participants completed MRI and neuropsychological measures. Clinical variables including liver function, HIV-viral load, and CD4 count were collected from the patient groups. DTI metrics including mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD), and fractional anisotropy (FA) from five subregions of the corpus callosum were compared across groups. The HIV+/HCV+ group and HIV+ group were similar in terms of HIV clinical variables. None of the participants met criteria for cirrhosis or fibrosis. Within the anterior corpus callosum, significant differences were observed between both HIV+ groups compared to HIV- controls on DTI measures. HIV+ and HIV+/HCV+ groups had significantly lower FA values and higher MD and RD values compared to HIV- controls; however, no differences were present between the HIV+ and HIV+/HCV+ groups. Duration of HIV infection was significantly related to DTI metrics in total corpus callosum FA only, but not other markers of HIV disease burden or neurocognitive function. Both HIV+ and HIV+/HCV+ individuals had significant alterations in white matter integrity within the corpus callosum; however, there was no evidence for an additive effect of HCV coinfection. The association between DTI metrics and duration of HIV infection suggests that HIV may continue to negatively impact white matter integrity even in well-controlled disease.",D Clifford; B M Ances; R H Paul; J M Heaps-Woodruff; P W Wright,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,International,Research Board,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Lead / Corresponding author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Jodi,Woodruff,Missouri Primary Care Health Homes successfully reduce inpatient and emergency department utilization. A brief report.,,,2019.0,,,,,Completed/Published,,,,,Spring,2019,"<p>To determine healthcare utilization outcomes for Primary Care Health Home participants compared to a matched control group. Missouri Medicaid paid claims data for the years 2011-2017 were used to investigate ER and hospitalization events comparing 8,970 adults (18-64) receiving primary care in a Health Home setting to 8386 propensity score matched adult control participants who received primary care in non-Health Home settings. Participants were excluded from analyses if they were enrolled in managed care or Medicare at any point from 2011-2017. Decreases in healthcare utilization for ER visits and hospital length of stay were observed for both the PCHH and control groups. Additionally, an interaction between each of the utilization measures and Medicaid eligibility months was observed. <span> </span>On average, enrollees in the PCHH had fewer ER visits, hospital admissions, and hospital days with increasing number of months of Medicaid eligibility compared to the control group. These results indicate that patients with complex, chronic medical conditions who are enrolled in Health Home programs may have greater benefits from longer exposure to the program and consistent Medicaid coverage. </p>

The present study examines the correspondence between white matter fiber bundle length and behavioral inhibition in 37 community-dwelling older adults (aged 51-78 years). Participants underwent neuroimaging with 3 Tesla MRI, and completed a behavioral test of inhibition (i.e., Go/NoGo task). Quantitative tractography derived from diffusion tensor imaging (qtDTI) was used to measure white matter fiber bundle lengths (FBLs) in tracts known to innervate frontal brain regions, including the anterior corpus callosum (AntCC), the cingulate gyrus segment of the cingulum bundle (CING), uncinate fasciculus (UNC), and the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). Performance on the Go/NoGo task was measured by the number of commission errors standardized to reaction time. Hierarchical regression models revealed that shorter FBLs in the CING (p < 0.05) and the bilateral UNC (p < 0.01) were associated with lower inhibitory performance after adjusting for multiple comparisons, supporting a disconnection model of response inhibition in older adults. Prospective longitudinal studies are needed to examine the evolution of inhibitory errors in older adult populations and potential for therapeutic intervention.",Thomas E Conturo; David H Laidlaw; Ryan P Cabeen; Robert H Paul; Paola M Garcia-Egan; Jodi M Heaps-Woodruff; Laur E Salminen; Rebecca N Preston-Campbell; Lila Balla,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,International,Research Board,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Co-author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

It draws conceptual comparisons between the Housing First approach to chronic homelessness and the Med First approach to pharmacotherapy for OUD, and compares state certification standards for substance use disorder (SUD) treatment (the traditional approach) to Med First guidelines for OUD treatment. Finally, the Perspective details how Med First principles have been practically implemented. : Med First principles emphasize timely access to maintenance pharmacotherapy without requiring psychosocial services or discontinuation for any reason other than harm to the client. Early results regarding medication utilization and treatment retention are promising. Feedback from providers has been largely favorable, though clinical- and system-level obstacles to effective OUD treatment remain. : Like the Housing First model, Medication First is designed to decrease human suffering and activate the strengths and capacities of people in need. It draws on decades of research and facilitates partnerships between psychosocial and medical treatment providers to offer effective and life-saving care to persons with OUD.",Ned Presnall; Rachel P Winograd; Tim Rudder; Lauren Green; Alex Duello; Phil Horn; Claire Wood; Erin Stringfellow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 2018, this exceeded $19 billion across 23 states. To put that amount into perspective, 2018 federal spending on Title I programs was $15.8 billion. This revenue stream is often ignored in analyses of state aid for K–12 and its distribution across districts. Until recently, accounting standards did not require pension plans to report these implicit subsidies to the school districts, so they did not typically know the size of their subsidy. In some important cases, it was missing from state totals for education aid. In the first comprehensive tabulation of these data, we show that this subsidy can be as much as $2,400 per pupil, as it is in Connecticut. In Illinois, it comprises an additional 56% of state spending on K–12 on top of all formula and categorical aid.",Robert M Costrell (Role:Author); Collin Hitt (Role:Author); James V Shuls (Role:Author),,,Blind Peer Reviewed,National,Research Council,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Co-author,Laura and John Arnold Foundation,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Description: Enrollment in school choice programs is growing, so is overall support for school choice. Many have analyzed what demographic characteristics impact attitudes towards school choice. This article adds to the literature by exploring the interaction between personal decisions regarding school choice and broader support for school choice programs. Focus groups were conducted in St. Louis and Kansas City with 35 parents of school-age children. Participant responses indicate that school choice programs illicit mixed emotions from parents. Most participants personally support school choice and exercise choice themselves by sending their children to magnet, charter, or private schools. At the same time, they have reservations about broader school choice programs. As Schelling (1978) suggests, these individuals act in their own self-interest despite the impact it might have on the aggregate. More to the point, they are willing to express choice themselves, but deny it to others.

Description: From funding to teacher quality, inequities exist between school districts. This paper adds to the literature on inequities by examining the impact of pension plan formulas on pension benefits. Using data from the salary schedules of 464 Missouri school districts, this paper analyzes how various final average salary calculations would impact the benefits of teachers in different districts. All of the schools in this analysis belong to Missouri’s Public Employee Retirement System, which is a defined-benefit pension plan. A teacher’s benefit in this plan is based on her years of experience and her final average salary. The system uses a three-year final average salary calculation. This captures salaries when they are most inequitable, at the end of the schedule. When more years of service are used in the final average salary calculation, inequities in benefits are reduced, but not eliminated.

Description: State policy makers are constantly looking for ways to improve teacher quality. An oft tried method is to increase the rigor of licensure exams. This study utilizes state administrative data from Arkansas to determine whether raising the cut-scores on licensure exams would improve the quality of the teacher workforce. In addition, the study explores the trade-offs of such a policy decision. It is concluded that raising the required passing score on the Praxis II would increase the quality of the teacher workforce, as measured by value-added student achievement. This change, however, would be accompanied with an important trade-off as it would reduce the number of minority teachers and potentially lead to negative outcomes in disadvantaged schools.

Description: This paper explores school choice through the prism of school finance. The design of school choice programs, specifically how they are funded, has important implications for the legality of a program and with issues related to equity. These matters are incredibly important as states continually grapple with questions related to adequacy and equity in school finance. As school choice programs continue to expand, they offer an opportunity not just to expand educational options, as proponents suggest, but to improve how we fund education for all students. This paper explores the issues related to school finance and school choice litigation, and then offers a school choice model that might be used to increase equity in finance and in educational options.

This may happen in Defined Benefit pension plans because they often do not base benefits on contributions, but on a formula, which takes into account a short window of time. Using two sources of data, school district salary schedules and actual teacher salaries for Missouri teachers, we estimate the prevalence of salary spiking. We do this by using seven years of actual salary data to forecast a worker’s final three years then compare this forecast to the individual’s actual wages. While we find evidence of salary spiking in all our samples and models, our estimates of spiking vary considerably across years. This suggests that some macro factors in the economy, possibly the lingering impacts of the great recession, may affect estimates of salary spiking.",Joseph Lux; James V Shuls,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,International,None,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Lead / Corresponding author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Ryan,Carpenter,Do alcohol-related consequences and how they are evaluated predict consumption during and days until the next drinking event?,Psychology of addictive behaviors : journal of the Society of Psychologists in Addictive Behaviors,5/24/2021,2021.0,35,587-596,,,Completed/Published,10.1037/adb0000747,34424029,PMC8382882,1939-1501,Fall,2021," Alcohol-related consequences are most often examined as outcomes of alcohol use. However, it is also possible that experiencing consequences may predict future drinking behavior. The predictive power of consequences on future drinking behavior may involve both objective experiences of consequences and subjective evaluations of those consequences (i.e., how positive, how negative). The purpose of the present study was to understand how positive and negative alcohol-related consequences-and evaluations of those consequences-predict elements of the next drinking event among college students.  96 participants reported alcohol use and related consequences over a 28-day daily assessment period.  Survival analysis and multilevel modeling were used to examine the influence of positive and negative consequences from a given drinking event on latency to and number of drinks consumed at the next drinking event. Contrary to hypotheses, subsequent drinking was not impacted by recent consequences nor how they were perceived.  Though theoretically, experiencing alcohol consequences may impact proximal drinking behavior, findings suggest that, in the current sample, other factors have greater importance in the latency between drinking events and amount of alcohol consumed. Future work should continue to identify event-level predictors that impact behavior at the next drinking event, and ways drinkers attempt to avoid repetition of drinking consequences other than simply drinking less (e.g., protective behavioral strategies), as such factors would be valuable targets for intervention.

We conducted a systematic literature review of 35 Ambulatory Assessment and Daily Diary studies of NSSI, to achieve three aims. First, we reviewed descriptive evidence on NSSI acts. On average, studies observed 1.6 acts per participant, but evidence regarding methods, pain, and context was sparse. Second, we reviewed evidence on NSSI urges. On average, studies reported 4.3 urges per participant. Urges were also associated with increased negative affect and predicted later acts. Third, we reviewed evidence on the Four-function Model of NSSI. Eight studies partially supported negative intrapersonal reinforcement, showing increased negative affect pre NSSI, but, of these, only four studies supported decreased negative affect post NSSI. Additionally, only three studies supported positive intrapersonal reinforcement, showing decreased positive affect pre and increased positive affect post NSSI. Evidence for the interpersonal functions was limited to two studies and inconclusive. We recommend assessing the intensity, frequency, and context of acts and urges, as well as pain and urge duration in future studies. We also recommend follow-up prompts after acts and urges to better track affect trajectories, and a detailed assessment of interpersonal events.",Sara E Schmitz; Johanna Hepp; Inga Niedtfeld; Ryan W Carpenter; Lisa M Störkel; Christian Schmahl,,,,,,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Co-author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

BPD is characterized by dysregulated emotion. Given previously observed relationships between emotion dysregulation and pain, we hypothesized that components of this dysregulation-elevated and labile negative affect and emotion sensitivity-would account for the relationship between BPD features and various pain complaints in a chronic pain patient sample. Specifically, we hypothesized that negative affect would indirectly predict pain through higher emotion sensitivity to pain, operationalized as pain anxiety sensitivity. To test these hypotheses, we administered a series of self-report measures to 147 patients at a chronic pain treatment facility. As expected, BPD features predicted pain severity (β = .19, p = .029), activity interference from pain (β = .22, p = .015), and affective interference from pain (β = .41, p < .001). Using path analyses, we found that the associations between BPD features and pain severity and interference were accounted for by serial indirect pathways through affective lability then pain anxiety and, to a lesser extent, through trait anxiety then pain anxiety. This is the first study to demonstrate roles for affective lability and pain anxiety sensitivity in the association between BPD features and chronic pain complaints in a chronic pain sample.

A close understanding of the phenomenology of NSSI urges and the contexts in which they occur is therefore warranted. We used ambulatory assessment to examine the environmental, interpersonal, and affective contexts of NSSI urges. We recruited 56 participants with borderline personality disorder who reported on urges and contexts for 21 days with six random daily prompts, resulting in 5,750 completed assessments. Twenty-two participants reported 160 NSSI urges. We provide extensive descriptive results characterizing the interaction partners, activities, and events participants reported in association with NSSI urges. Results from a logistic multilevel model using the full sample (testing associations between all contexts and urges simultaneously) revealed that urges were more likely to occur at higher levels of negative affect, when rejection was experienced, and later in the day. Urges were not associated with disagreements or feeling let down, being at home versus away, being alone versus in company, socializing versus doing another activity, and it being a weekday versus weekend. Additional growth curve analysis for negative affect using the subsample of 22 participants who reported urges showed that, over the course of urge days compared with nonurge days, negative affect increased before urges, peaked during the urge, and then decreased, approximating a quadratic curve. We conclude that urges occurred primarily in the context of negative affect and rejection, which is consistent with theories on intra- and interpersonal functions of NSSI.

The present study replicated these between-person associations and extended past research by assessing whether the FFM explains within-person variance in the manifestation of momentary BPD symptoms in the presence or absence of close social contact (CSC). We measured CSC and the BPD core symptoms negative affectivity, impulsivity, and interpersonal problems in 74 BPD patients and in a clinical control group of 40 depressed patients over the course of 28 days, 6 times a day. The FFM domains showed specificity in predicting momentary BPD symptoms and interacted with CSC in doing so. In particular, for BPD individuals only, momentary impulsivity and interpersonal problems were associated with higher neuroticism and extraversion and lower agreeableness, and these associations were especially strong in situations involving CSC. Negative affectivity was predicted by neuroticism for both groups of individuals, and this association was generally unaffected by CSC. Overall, experiencing CSC was positively associated with momentary BPD symptoms. Thus, both the FFM and CSC were associated with BPD patients' experience of symptoms in everyday life. Furthermore, specific FFM trait domains were particularly impactful in contexts where BPD symptoms are more likely to be manifested, providing further evidence that person-by-situation interactions are important for understanding BPD symptoms in the moment.

They were shown to covary in the daily lives of patients in a recent ambulatory assessment study (Hepp et al., 2017) that observed comparatively larger positive associations between interpersonal stressors and negative affect in individuals with BPD than those with depressive disorders. The present study sought to replicate these findings, collecting data on hostility, sadness, fear, and rejection or disagreement events from 56 BPD and 60 community control participants for 21 days, 6 times a day. Using identical statistical procedures, the positive associations between momentary rejection/disagreement and hostility, sadness, and fear were replicated. Again replicating the original study, the rejection-hostility, rejection-sadness, and disagreement-hostility associations were significantly stronger in the BPD group. Time-lagged analyses extended the original study, revealing that rejection was associated with subsequent hostility and sadness more strongly in the BPD group, as was disagreement with subsequent hostility and fear. Though small, we argue that the observed group differences reflect meaningful pervasive responses in a daily life context. Future research should consider these when implementing affect regulation strategies that are applicable in interpersonal contexts for all individuals, but particularly those with BPD.

We used ecological momentary assessment to examine the effects of DTC during daily-life drinking episodes in a sample of current drinkers (N = 110; 52 individuals with borderline personality disorder and 58 community individuals). Multilevel models were used to test whether momentary and episode-level endorsement of DTC-depression and DTC-anxiety motives would be related to increased subjective drinking-contingent relief and decreased depression and anxiety during drinking episodes. Momentary DTC-anxiety predicted greater subsequent drinking-contingent relief, and greater episode-level DTC-anxiety and DTC-depression predicted greater drinking-contingent relief during the episode. However, we did not find decreased depression and anxiety following endorsement of DTC-depression and DTC-anxiety. Instead, we found that greater episode-level DTC-depression was associated with increased depression. Thus, findings suggest that individuals' negative affective states may not improve during DTC despite endorsing drinking-contingent relief. This discrepancy warrants further attention because subjective relief likely reinforces DTC, whereas awareness of one's change (or lack of change) in affect may provide valuable counterevidence for whether alcohol use is an effective coping strategy.

Physical health, and specifically pain, is one such domain that has gone understudied. Although evidence suggests that BPD is associated with chronic pain, few studies have examined nonchronic pain in the disorder. The current study used ambulatory assessment to examine momentary physical pain in everyday life in BPD outpatients ( = 26) and community comparisons (COM;  = 26) not in treatment for chronic pain ( = 5,458). We predicted and observed that BPD outpatients would report greater pain intensity and greater pain variability than COM comparisons. We also examined the relationship of pain and emotion dysregulation, a core feature of BPD, by testing the association between pain and negative affect concurrently and lagged over time. We predicted that momentary pain and negative affect would be associated in both groups, but that pain would predict negative affect more strongly in the BPD group. As predicted, concurrent pain and negative affect were associated in both groups, and groups differed significantly in terms of the association of lagged pain and next-assessment negative affect, with a negative association in the COM group. The current study represents a preliminary first step, finding that pain is relevant to the everyday experience of BPD individuals. This pain propensity may contribute to the elevated prevalence of BPD in chronic pain samples. Further, BPD individuals demonstrated emotional reactivity to pain, suggesting that pain may be a contributor to emotion dysregulation in this disorder.

In this pilot project, we assessed the effect of a painful thermal stimulus on drinking topography in a virtual reality bar environment using real alcohol-containing beverages. We also examined psychosocial factors that may account for individual differences in pain as an antecedent for alcohol use. Participants ( = 20,  = 25.65 years, 55% female, 15% Hispanic/Latino/a/x) completed a psychosocial screening battery before completing two counterbalanced alcohol self-administration sessions. In each, participants experienced either painful heat (44 °C) or nonnoxious warmth (38 °C). Sip interval (s) and sip volume (g) were measured. Effects of pain on drinking topography were assessed using multilevel models. Multilevel models assessed associations of pain-related changes in topography with hypothesized vulnerability factors. Analyses indicated a significant interaction of pain condition and sex on sip interval ( = -.16.96,  = .015, 95% CI [-30.75, -2.97]), such that painful heat significantly decreased sip interval in men ( = 16.38) but not women ( = -.45). No effect of pain on sip volume was detected ( > .49). Exploratory analyses indicated significant interactions such that the effect of the painful heat condition was stronger in individuals with higher levels of greater negative urgency but the opposite effect for pain catastrophizing. Results suggest acute pain has sex-contingent effects on drinking topography, such that men drank more rapidly while experiencing painful heat. Furthermore, analyses indicated that individuals with greater negative urgency, regardless of sex, may be at elevated risk for hazardous alcohol use when experiencing pain.

First, we present data from a 5-day daily diary protocol. We recruited a large sample ( = 321 at Day 1) screened for a history of self-identified mental health issues and weekly alcohol use. Participant adherence was good (82%) even without in-person contact. Alcohol use patterns conformed to theoretical expectations: Participants were more likely to drink on Fridays and Saturdays than other days, men drank more than women, and higher Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT; Saunders et al., 1993) scores were associated with an increased likelihood of use and more overall drinking on a given day. Second, we present data from 429 Prolific participants screened for a history of mental health issues who completed assessments 2 weeks apart with strong retention ( = 377; 88%). We compare these data with the data from undergraduates ( = 529) to demonstrate Prolific's utility for conducting psychometrically oriented substance use research. Internal consistency estimates for measures from the Prolific data matched or exceeded those from the undergraduate data. Furthermore, measure scores showed strong temporal stability, and factor structures (e.g., AUDIT item-level structures) conformed to theoretical expectations.

Craving is a fundamental feature of addiction and disorder, yet the contexts in which craving occurs and is associated with substance use is still under-researched. We examined alcohol craving and consumption in a sample of 56 BPD individuals and a comparison group of community drinkers (COM;  = 60) who carried electronic diaries for approximately 21 days. BPD individuals reported more craving than COM individuals in most contexts. Compared to COM individuals, elevated craving in BPD individuals was paralleled by more drinking when at work, at home, and with romantic partners, coworkers, and children.

Building from laboratory data supporting associations between cue exposure, stress, and craving, this study tested whether these associations generalize to real-world settings and examined whether a well-vetted neurocognitive control capacity, i.e., working memory (WM), moderated associations. Youth ( = 85; 15-24 years) completed baseline and ecological momentary assessments. Cue exposure and participants' average stress predicted higher craving. Youth with weaker WM experienced stronger craving at higher-stress moments but not when faced with cues. Interactions were present for both previous-moment and same-moment stress.

This study sought to identify internal and situational influences on unplanned marijuana use among youth ages 15 to 24 years (N = 85; 48% female; 27% age <18 years). Additionally, we disentangled person-level associations from within-person day-to-day influences. Ecological momentary assessment methods captured affective (positive: energized, excited, sociable, happy, relaxed; negative: bored, tense, sad, stressed) and situational factors in real-world settings during a 1-week monitoring period. Participants reported no plan to use on 51% of days (269/527), and youth ultimately used marijuana on 35% of these unplanned days. At the day level, on days when youth spent more time in the presence of marijuana-related cues than they typically do, they used more grams on planned days and less on unplanned days. Regardless of use plans, youth were more likely to use on days when they spent more time with using friends and if they reported greater availability of marijuana in general across the monitoring period. At the person level, youth who generally reported higher positive affect, relative to other participants, used more on planned days and less on unplanned days. Regardless of use plans, youth who generally reported greater craving and time in the presence of marijuana-related cues used more grams, whereas youth who generally reported greater negative affect used less. Together, findings revealed several factors, with clear clinical relevance, which may explain why some youth struggle to control their marijuana use.

However, findings from daily life studies examining the interaction of motives and affect to predict alcohol use are mixed. Individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD) may be particularly susceptible to drinking for the purpose of changing affective states, representing a population in which these patterns may be more readily identifiable in daily life. We tested whether drinking motives moderate daily life associations between affect and drinking in individuals with BPD. Regular drinkers with BPD ( = 54; 81.5% female) completed ecological momentary assessments approximately 6-10 times daily for 21 days. We tested whether the interactions between (a) person-level coping motives and NA so far that day (i.e., cumulative-average NA), and (b) person-level enhancement and cumulative-average PA were associated with subsequent drinking. We also tested whether effects differed for the initiation versus continuation of a drinking episode. Using generalized estimating equations, the interaction between coping and cumulative-average NA was positively associated with momentary drinking, with some evidence for a stronger relation during the continuation of drinking. The interaction between enhancement motives and cumulative-average PA was positively associated with initiation but negatively associated with continuation of drinking. Our novel approach of using cumulative-average affect and distinguishing initiation and continuation of drinking allowed us to examine differential momentary patterns across the drinking episode, and results suggest that awareness of motives as well as affect leading up to and during drinking may be a useful intervention target.

Yet, the conditions that predict momentary changes in craving in real time among adolescents remain unclear.  This study examined the interactive effects of momentary risk-taking propensity and affect on adolescents' alcohol craving by leveraging ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methods.  Participants were 29 adolescents ages 15-19 years (55% female; 69% White; 10% Black; 17% Hispanic); 45% met criteria for alcohol dependence. Following a laboratory session that captured self-report and behavioral assessments, including the well-established Balloon Analog Risk Task (BART), participants completed multiple daily assessments of alcohol craving, positive and negative affect, and risk propensity for approximately one week. Momentary risk propensity was captured in real-world settings via an EMA behavioral task (""Balloon Game"").  Mixed-effects models with EMA reports (Level 1) nested within participants (Level 2) revealed the majority (74%) of variability in ""Balloon Game"" performance was due to within-person, momentary, fluctuations. Greater momentary positive affect predicted increased alcohol craving, but only when participants exhibited heightened risk-taking propensity. Negative affect did not influence the relation between momentary risk-taking and craving.  Momentary fluctuations in positive affect predicted acute increases in craving but only in moments when adolescents demonstrated higher levels of risk-taking propensity, as captured with an EMA-delivered behavioral task. Momentary risk-taking assessments offer new avenues to substantiate dominant theories on the driving mechanisms of craving and alcohol use among adolescents.",Tim Janssen; Noah N N Emery; Ryan W Carpenter; Robert Miranda; Hayley Treloar Padovano,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sample consisted of 1,787 participants from an outpatient treatment facility. Confirmatory factor analysis replicated the existence of Positive and Negative Activation subscales. Logistic regressions, as hypothesized, found that Positive Activation was positively associated only with bipolar disorder, while Negative Activation was associated with almost all disorders.

The cat has one major blood group with three serotypes; the most common blood type A being dominant to type B. A third rare blood type is known as AB and has an unclear mode of inheritance. Cat blood type antigens are defined, with N-glycolylneuraminic acid being associated with type A and N-acetylneuraminic acid with type B. Blood type AB is serologically characterized by agglutination using typing reagents directed against both A and B epitopes. While a genetic characterization of blood type B has been achieved, the rare type AB serotype remains genetically uncharacterized. A genome-wide association study in Ragdoll cats (22 cases and 15 controls) detected a significant association between blood type AB and SNPs on cat chromosome B2, with the most highly associated SNP being at position 4,487,432 near the candidate gene cytidine monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase. A novel variant, c.364C>T, was identified that is highly associated with blood type AB in Ragdoll cats and, to a lesser degree, with type AB in random bred cats.

We identified and coded 63 articles that used IRT on empirical data published in industrial-organizational and organizational behavior journals since 2000. Results show that typical usage for IRT conforms to best practices in several ways; however, in other ways, such as testing for and reporting model fit, there is still significant room for improvement. Next, we surveyed academic and practitioner members of the Society for Industrial-Organizational Psychology (SIOP) on their experiences and attitudes toward IRT. We conclude that IRT is one area where practice outpaces science. There is a cadre of practitioners that consider IRT essential to their professional life. For others, however, IRT is seen as less relevant. Based on our coding analyses and survey results, we provide suggestions on how to better incorporate IRT into organizational research and practice.",Garett Coleman Foster; Hanyi Min; Michael J Zickar,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,,,,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Lead / Corresponding author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

While the field of organization development has historically focused on developmental aspects of personality tools, other disciplines such as industrial-organizational psychology have emphasized its psychometric properties. The importance of data-driven insights for talent management (e.g., the identification of high potentials, succession planning, coaching), however, is placing increasing pressure on all types of applied behavioral scientists to better understand the stability of personality tools for decision-making purposes. The current study presents research conducted with 207 senior leaders in a global consumer products organization on the use of personality assessment data over time and across two different conditions: development only and development to decision making. Results using three different tools (based on the Hogan Assessment Suite) indicate that core personality and personality derailers are generally not affected by the purpose of the assessment, though derailers do tend to moderate over time. The manifestation of values, motives, and preferences were found to change across administrations.

Companies are rapidly adopting new tools and approaches in a variety of what has traditionally been core areas of I-O psychology such as performance management, employee attitudes, recruiting, testing and assessment, and career development.  Increasingly, however, these new approaches have little to no research backing behind them and they do not tend to be the focus of I-O theory and research.  We call this trend anti-industrial and organizational psychology (AIO) as we believe these forces to do not advance the field for long-term strategic impact.  We present a framework that describes how AIO practices are adopted by organizations, and how industrial-organizational (I-O) psychologists often gravitate away from these practices rather than actively help to separate the wheat from the chaff.  We found support for our hypothesis through a brief analysis of Industrial and Organizational Psychology: Perspectives on Science and Practice, the peer-reviewed journal of the Society of Industrial and Organizational Psychology (SIOP).  In this analysis, we found that only 10% of the focal articles from 2008 to 2016 represented topics that we call frontier, emerging areas in organizations but where there is no research support for them.  We propose a set of recommendations for the field of I-O psychology and call for a more strategic approach to identifying and vetting new TM trends in order to increase the relevancy and impact of I-O for our key stakeholders.",Garett Coleman Foster; Amanda C Shulll; Allan H Church; Seymour Adler; Christopher T Rotolo; James W Smither; Karen B Paul; Alan L Colquitt,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,National,,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Co-author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

METHODS: This cohort included 546 athletes, > or =18 years old, who were free from injury at the beginning of the study. This investigation focused on the relative risk of athletes from 4 main sports (football/soccer n= 161, track and field, n= 106, basketball, n = 120 and rugby, n= 159). RESULTS: Seventy- five lost-time injuries (n= 75) in both male and female athletes who sustained abrasions, concussion, contusion, dislocations, laceration, fainting, fractures, sprains and strain injuries were reported. There was an increased risk of sports injuries among athletes who didn’t undergo pre-participation evaluation compared to those who did. The relative risk for sports injuries in athletes without pre-participation evaluation was greater in rugby (relative risk, 211.2, 95% CI, 13.6 - 33.88), followed by football/soccer (relative risk, 210.61, 95% CI, 3.1 - 33.78), followed by track and field (relative risk, 95% CI, 9.0- 23.17) and basketball (relative risk, 121.8, 95% CI, 7.56 to 19.63). CONCLUSION: Pre-participation evaluation is an important risk factor in sports injury acquisition.

African American women have disparate rates of trauma exposure and subsequent PTSD that is often considered in relation to their religion, spirituality, and the availability of social support. The present study adds to the existing literature by examining various religious behaviors and social support among 101 African American women who were distinguished based on the problem generating nature of their traumatic event. Almost all of the women experienced an event (91%), of which a majority of the events qualified as traumatic (61%), and a quarter of the women who experienced an event (27%) experienced the additive influence of PTSD. A majority of the women reported frequent religious behaviors such as daily prayer (80%) and taking religious advice or teaching into consideration (67%). Most also reported the availability of social support. There was a higher probability of being in the additive PTSD group if women had ever married and reported poorer health.

This study examines the religious/spiritual practices of 106 African American women when addiction is present. Stratified sampling was based on addiction status: no addiction (n=58); addiction to one of either alcohol, marijuana, or cocaine (n=22); and addiction to two or more of the substances (n=26). Using items from the Religiosity Scale to assess belief in God, religious behaviors, commitment and connection, analyses revealed that the majority of the women (84%) believe God exists and is active in their lives. However not all demonstrated formal religious behaviors or have a commitment or connection to religious activities. Women addicted to two or more substances were more likely to report religious behaviors, commitment, and connection such as regular personal religious-based reading/studying and having a feeling of religious commitment compared to women with no or only one addiction. Women with co-occurring addictions may utilize religious-based practices in an attempt to alleviate their emotional pain. Further exploration of religious/spiritual practices and co-morbid substance addiction is needed, as this research may be vital to implementing effective interventions with this population.",Sha Lai L Williams; Joseph G.

This qualitative study assessed clinical social worker, psychiatrist and patient navigator strategies to increase depression treatment among low-income minority cancer patients participating in the ADAPt-C clinical depression trial. Patient care retention strategies were elicited through in-depth, semi-structured interviews with nine behavioral health providers. Using grounded theory, concepts from the literature and dropout barriers identified by patients, guided interview prompts. Retention strategies clustered around five dropout barriers: (1) informational, (2) instrumental, (3) provider-patient therapeutic alliance, (4) clinic setting, and (5) depression treatment. All strategies emphasized the importance of communication between providers and patients. Findings suggest that strong therapeutic alliance and telephone facilitates collaborative team provider communication and depression treatment retention among patients in safety-net oncology care systems.

Mitchell,Millstein,Unlocking Cost Saving Opportunities Hidden in Hospital Tier Contracts,Omega-International Journal of Management Science,,2021.0,,,,,Submitted,,,,,Fall,2021,"The outbreak of COVID-19 intensifies the immense financial challenges that hospitals face. Spending on medical supplies alone accounts for up to 40% of a hospital’s expenses and continues growing faster than labor costs, making it a prime focus of hospital executives. A major challenge to reduce medical supply costs is the exceptionally complex tier pricing structures offered by suppliers. The interdependencies among pricing tiers at a facility (hospital) and network level, along with the existence of physician preference items and asymmetric product substitutability, make it essential for healthcare organizations to use prescriptive analytical approaches to achieve spend optimization. In this paper, we present a novel mathematical programming model to validate current spending patterns, and to optimize procurement decisions, among multiple suppliers with complex tier pricing schemes. The model includes substitutability of products across suppliers, and can also incorporate physician preferences. The application of the model to real-world cases achieves 13% to 35% overall savings on medical supply costs by shifting purchases to exploit tier pricing schemes. We demonstrate that while physician preference items in general have been highly criticized for inflating medical supply costs, only a few may be “critical” for reducing costs and should be the focus of management resources. Results also reveal that reducing product variety does not necessarily decrease product acquisition costs, and the current contracting structure may not encourage product standardization which hospitals have been trying to achieve.",Mitchell Alan Millstein (Role:Author); Liu Yang (Role:Author),Yes,Applied or Integration/Application Scholarship,Blind Peer Reviewed,National,None,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Co-author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,

Designing an effective omnichannel distribution network requires determining the location, number and capacity of warehouses, as well as allocating online and retail demands to facilities (stores or warehouses). Optimal omnichannel designs are influenced by the percentage of online demand, the level of competition and supply chain costs. This study evaluates three designs for omnichannel fulfillment: ship-from-store, ship-from-warehouse, and a hybrid approach that pools inventory in regional warehouses with local stores.  We vary the percent of total demand from online orders and the effect of competition on the online demand market share.  We consider three prototypical products of widely differing cost characteristics and formulate a mixed integer linear program to optimize the location, number and capacity of omnichannel warehouses for each design.  Results show how the facility locations and optimal channel design changes for each prototypical product in response to an increasing percentage of online demand, and increasing competition.

These patterns might be related to differential resistance among host populations reflecting intrinsic characteristics of both the host and the pathogen. In hematophagous parasites, in particular, the structure of host hemoglobin can influence parasite development and reproduction. Though variation in avian hemoglobin has been documented across altitudinal gradients, little is known about hemoglobin variation as it relates to infection by the parasites causing avian malaria. We sequenced the αA -globin subunit of Coereba flaveola (Bananaquit), and related sequence variation to avian malaria infection frequency and parasite lineage identity. We found no association between αA -globin haplotype and infection by particular parasite lineages among all locations, nor any protective association between globin haplotype frequency and the proportion of individuals infected within populations. Phylogeographic structure and genetic variation at the αA -globin locus, including a highly variable intron, is largely concordant with the mitochondrial cytochrome-b locus for these same populations, supporting this marker as an independent and variable target with potential application in biogeographic analyses.

Devin,Banks,Examination of the indirect effect of alcohol expectancies on ethnic identity and adolescent drinking outcomes,The American journal of orthopsychiatry,1/28/2019,2019.0,89,600-608,5,,Completed/Published,10.1037/ort0000390,30688482,PMC6661203,1939-0025,Fall,2019,"Although overall rates of alcohol use tend to be lower among racial/ethnic minority youth compared to White youth, consequences associated with use tend to be more severe. Identifying factors that prevent alcohol use is crucial to reducing its impact among minority adolescents. One such factor is ethnic identity, which involves gaining clarity about one's ethnic background and regard toward one's ethnic group. Strong ethnic identity has been found to work through antidrug beliefs to decrease minority youth's substance use. The current study extends previous literature by examining whether specific alcohol cognitions-alcohol expectancies-explain the promotive effect of ethnic identity on alcohol use and severity of alcohol use among minority youth. Participants were 113 ethnic minority youth ages 12-18 (M = 15.27). Most participants were male (66%) and identified as non-Hispanic African American/Black (70%), followed by Hispanic/Latino (15%), multiracial (12%), and American Indian/Native American (3%). Participants completed self-report measures of ethnic identity, positive and negative alcohol expectancies, and hazardous drinking, which were analyzed in an indirect effects model. Results indicated that ethnic identity was inversely related to negative alcohol expectancies. A significant indirect effect of ethnic identity on severity of alcohol use through negative alcohol expectancies was found. However, no indirect effect was found for positive alcohol expectancies. Findings suggest that strong ethnic identity serves as a promotive factor preventing alcohol use for ethnic minority youth, in part through more negative alcohol expectancies, and may be a beneficial target for intervention programs to reduce alcohol use among this group.

However, limited research has been conducted on the mechanisms through which family and peer factors increase risk for substance use among juvenile justice involved youth. The current study examined both the direct and indirect effects of family and peer substance use on youth's substance use (alcohol and illicit drug use). We also examined whether this relationship differs by race. 226 detained youth (81.9% male; 74.3% Black) were recruited from an urban county in the Midwest and completed a clinical interview and substance use assessment battery. A direct effect of family/peer risk on illicit drug use was found for all youth, though the effect was stronger among White youth. Results also supported the indirect effect pathway from family/peer risk to both illicit drug use and alcohol use through pro-drug attitudes. This pathway did not vary by race. These findings suggest that interventions should focus on targeting both family/peer risk and pro-drug attitudes to reduce substance use. Given the racial difference in the direct effect of family/peer risk on illicit drug use, there may be other factors that influence risk more strongly for White youth, which warrants further investigation.",Tamika C B Zapolski; Matthew Aalsma; Alexandra Hershberger; Riche L Clifton; Devin E Banks,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,International,,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Co-author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,7.0

Based on the social ecological framework, the current paper provides a comprehensive, narrative review of the past 14 years of literature examining HIV/STI risk, including risky sexual behavior, among heterosexual African American youth and a conceptual model of risk among this population. The review found that individual psychological and biological factors are insufficient to explain the sexual health disparities faced by this group; instead, structural disadvantage, interpersonal risk, and community dysfunction contribute to the disparity in HIV/STI outcomes directly and indirectly through individual psychological factors. The conceptual model presented suggests that for African American youth, (1) HIV/STI risk commonly begins at the structural level and trickles down to the community, social, and individual levels, (2) risk works in a positive feedback system such that downstream effects compound the influence of structural risks, and (3) contextual and individual risk factors must be considered within the advanced stage of the epidemic facing this population. Despite advanced HIV and STI epidemics among heterosexual African American youth, multisystemic interventions that target structural risk factors and their downstream effects are posited to reduce the disparity among this high-risk population.",Tamika C B Zapolski; Devin E Banks (Role:Author); Devon J Hensel,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,International,None,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Lead / Corresponding author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,1.0

Such consequences are amplified among concurrent substance users. Although sex and racial/ethnic differences in single-substance use have been observed, the current literature is inconclusive as to whether differences exist in the prevalence of concurrent use. The current study used data from the 2011-2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health to examine typologies (single and concurrent patterns) of alcohol, marijuana, and cigarette use among current adolescent users age 12-18 by sex and race/ethnicity. Participants were 14,667 White, Hispanic, African American, Asian, and Native American adolescents. The most common typology was alcohol only, followed by concurrent use of alcohol and marijuana. Weighted prevalence estimates indicated that adolescent females were more likely to be current users of alcohol only, whereas male adolescents were more likely to belong to all other typologies. Compared to Whites, racial/ethnic minorities had larger proportions of marijuana only users and were generally less likely than or equally likely to be concurrent users. One exception was for African American adolescents, who were more likely to be alcohol and marijuana users than their White counterparts. Results suggest that concurrent substance use is common among U.S. adolescents, making up over 40% of past-month use, but typologies of use vary by sex and race/ethnicity. Preventive interventions should consider all typologies of use rather than only single substance exposures and address patterns of use that are most pertinent to adolescents based on sex and race/ethnicity.",Devin E Banks; Philani Mpofu; Alia T Rowe; Tamika C B Zapolski,,,Blind Peer Reviewed,International,,Article,Yes,Journal-Research / Scholarly / Literary,Lead / Corresponding author,,,,,English,,Self-reported,32.0
